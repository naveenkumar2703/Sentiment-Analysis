3	Never mind the bollocks... Here's the Queen Victoria Pub. Just opened a few months ago, the pub has -many- beers on tap and the staff is friendly.  At $6.50+ a pint the prices are a bit steep.Food takes a bit of time to prepare but is well worth the wait (which is what you'd be doing for longer at Kady's). The Riv needed this pub in a bad way to offset the other establishments which are (or were) not as good as this place.They are constantly out of pancakes and it wouldn't hurt getting some better coffee and more staff as there is nothing -worse- than being seated then ignored for 25 minutes or more.Cheers!
3	This place was not ready to be descended upon by Defcon 18, so they were packed for lunch.  It was kind of a bad sign when the server needed to go ask if they had Bass on tap.I ordered the rare roast beef sandwich on sourdough with rocket, this per the description.  While the roast beef was rare, it was neither served on sourdough but marble rye with iceberg lettuce, not rocket.  Still it was a decent sandwich, served with chips, that were edible.Service was slow, the girl had no idea what she was doing, especially when she walked around the establishment for 10 minutes holding my credit card.
5	Food was fabulous beers were cold and Peter was the best as always!
5	The Queen Vic pub is authentic inside which I love. I've eaten a few times at the pub and I've had the fish and chips, sausage rolls, and the cornish pasty all of which were delicious. The food came out in no time at all, it was hot, fresh, and most of all really tasty. I saw a yummy looking spotted dick so I must try that next time I'm in there.
5	This place is awesome. Truly English and authentic. The staff is funny and the food is YUM!!!! A variety of entertainment every weekend. Love it!
3	The Fish sandwich is a little bit oily and the coleslaw wasn't fresh, but the smoked salmon sandwich & friench fries were good and fresh.
3	I've been here only once, and that was for a Roller Derby afterparty, so I'm gonna reserve more stars until I return on a regular night perhaps.  Otherwise, I'd gladly give it 4 stars for the awesome dance party that broke out.  The DJ was definitely busting out the most "get your ass on the dancefloor" tunes, and people were having a lot of fun.  I guess I could post some hot n scandalous pictures of the ladies leg wrestling, but I'm way too classy* (*=lazy) to do that.It's a much larger space than you would initially think, as the bar/restaurant winds back in to a large back room with darts and a pool table.  The prices were pretty reasonable compared to other places on the Strip ($6 for a Guinness).  After way too many beers people needed sustenance, and much (nonvegan) food was ordered.  I got fries.  Now, in my drunken haze I did not consult anyone to see if these might be fried in the same oil as meaty things (and they probably were), but damn those were about the best fries I've ever had.  British style chips, old chap.  With lots of malt vinegar.  Each one was crispy on the outside and delightfully creamy on the inside.  Other people got stuff like English breakfast, club sammiches, and chicken pot pie.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their stuff.  Check it out for some late night food and pints, and maybe a wild dance party if it's Roller Derby night.
4	My new Vegas destination, when Im in town. Wish I could have found the time to go back for more food...but thats no excuse cause the kitchen is open 24 hrs.Classic British food served by Brits... And so far the widest draft beer selection i have found on the strip.I'll be back again, and again, and again!
5	Hands down, the best thing about this place was the service. Nowhere else in Vegas is half as attentive, kind or warm-hearted in relation to its customers as this establishment was. I was checked up on in the least intrusive way I could imagine at a very regular rate. Everything I asked for was brought immediately and in abundance. The host/server/waiter was such a lovely person and he really stopped the plummeting enjoyment of my day and turned it right back up by being so wonderful. Really, words can't do it justice, so I will stop trying.This was more than a breath of fresh air in Las Vegas. I had battled other establishments trying to get service for food on the day that I arrived and therefore showed up *very* exasperated. The menu was exactly what I wanted, since I tend to call myself a pub food connoisseur. I ordered the roast beef sandwich and here is a major warning: it will burn you alive. It looks innocent, very moist and delicious with thick well seasoned fries on the side, but a demon lies beneath the surface. I took a bite and the horseradish was so thick and undiluted that I felt my mouth, nose, throat, stomach and somehow the upper back of head begin to burn. I found that the curry sauce was a great way to cool it down, by the way-- also a great addition to the yummy fries.My fiancee and I ordered chicken fingers to go with it as a part of the happy hour special for $3, as advertised on the table. When the bill came, it cost $9.50some for the chicken though, so when we asked the wonderful host about it he informed us that the promotion on the table was no longer available and he didn't know why the advertisement was still on the table, but he would take 10% off of our bill, which we grudgingly accepted. A minute later he walked back with the bill at 50% off. Amazing! I had planned on leaving a higher than average tip because of the wonderful service, but we ended up leaving an almost 100% tip because of how spectacular it was to be treated so well at a restaurant. I would recommend this place 100%-- the food was wonderful (though spicy), the music was very refreshingly good, classic rock and the service was out of this world. What more could a person want?
4	What's better than a 24 hour pub? A 24 hour pub in VEGAS that is able to serve anything from  hot wings to pancakes with a pint of a draft beer of your choice (from Guinness to a Blackened Tan to other British drafts) or  any other bottled brews or cocktails of your choice at 4:30AM! This was practically the most chill pub I have been to. They have really rocking music and an awesome cook and host/bartender! I almost forgot  I was inside The Riviera and that is was nearing 6:00AM!
3	Yes, I had another Groupon and I'm sure glad I did. I've heard about this place for a while, but I have never ventured over to the Riviera to check it out. We finally made it. I even braved the Riviera parking and lived to tell about it. Hehe.We walked into the Queen Vic and were pleasantly surprised by the decor. Nothing like you'd expect for being located in the Riviera. We were seated in a back booth and I think this is where we went wrong. Our server was not very attentive and it took her forever to even notice we were there, despite attempts to get her attention as she wandered by. She finally came to get our drink order. When it was time to order, we again had a hard time locating her. The place wasn't packed, so I really don't know what was taking her so long. She finally took our order and we waited...and waited...and waited. Finally our food came out, after what seemed quite a bit of time. I ordered the chicken curry pie which was yum yum. My fella got the chicken and mushroom pie and my friend ordered the Cornish Pasty. We all agreed on four stars for the food alone, but I had to drop one for the lousy service. I have to say, I think the service was an anomoly, since no one else seemed to be having any trouble with service, so I tend to blame our server in particular. I definitely look forward to trying this place out again. The food was delicious, I'll just be careful not to be seated in this particular server's area. Hopefully I can make it a four star review after my next visit.
5	Stumbled upon this place last night..Wow what a cool place!Just wanted to check it out and have a beer..but ended up getting a scotch egg..it was so good..I actually think it was the best one that  I have ever had. Great service..great decor..really fun place! Really looking forward to coming back!!
3	Fish & Chips made with the traditional cod, served with peas as well.  Light and fluffy, generous portions, reasonably priced.Burger was delicious, with just the right amount of charbroiled taste, I chose fries, but you have several items to choose from.Service was friendly and fast, although I was with someone who knows everyone there, so I don't know if it would be the same if I went alone.Of course 'futbol' was on the various flatscreen TVs, two Italian teams were playing.  That's fine with me since soccer is the only sport I really follow.Would love to go again and try something more 'Brit' from the menu, just wasn't feeling too adventurous on this first outing.Cheers!
3	What a surprise to find a place in the Riviera that is actually popular. Queen Vic is of course a English style pub, and because of that, I made my choice to try the fish and chips here.I know Sysco Foods when I smell it, and this is fish and chips made with Sysco Foods. I'm not knocking the distributor, I'm just saying that it's a very distinctive taste that I found in many of their foods.The fish was tasty, I give them a plus for that. The chips were not crispy, more soft and limpy. If you like limpy fries, you can have mine because I like crispy crunchy fries.Here is a quick tip, go sign up for the Riviera's players club, you get 10$ off food at Queen Vic's.
3	This place has a good beer selection, friendly & effecient staff, and a nice relaxed vibe to it.  The food is pretty good, not great, but good.  Maybe it's just me, but every know and then its nice to sit at a bar in Vegas that doesn't have a VP machine built into it.Also, if you are looking for British sports, this seems to be a good place.  Alas, I just don't get that crickett.
2	The wife and I decided to use up our Groupon here for an early dinner  this evening.Being a "Commonwealther" all things from "The Mother Country" usually go down pretty well with me, however QVP was a really mixed bag.The first thing I thought when we were seated was "nice flags, sheesh it's loud in here". I know it's a pub, but there wasn't really the relaxed atmosphere here that I associate with British pubs - instead there were a lot of people loudly cheering a basketball game - like in any US sports bar.. Right off the bat this was a problem for me, so please understand in advance that this is a review of Queen Vic as a dining experience and not as a bar.Being Australian, I naturally thought I'd try the "Aussie beef pie" which, despite not being pie-shaped was OK enough. Tiny considering the $13 price tag, but pretty tasty considering the great quality of the filling. Not what I'd call an authentic Australian pie, but decent as something all its own. The pie came with some cold and nondescript mashed potatoes with cooked peas and carrots. After polishing off my $13 pie in about half a dozen mouthfuls I knew I was going to be hungry later (fortunately Riviera has a tasty Indian restaurant in the food court so we decided to pick up some stuff from there for later on this evening).Service was friendly but very slow. I felt like the drinkers got the lion's share of the attention and there was at least 25 minutes that went by between our plates being cleared and us getting out the door, It was a little disconcerting to have my credit card taken only to see the same server walking around taking someone's order several minutes after they disappeared with my card. They did apologize for the slowness, so that was OK, but it didn't round off an already mediocre experience very nicely.Overall I think you'll probably like QVP if you're into bars and drinking and would like a bit of comfort food to go with your drinks. As an Australian my experience here didn't make me feel whisked away into a familiar Commonwealth vibe and the place just isn't really for me.
4	If your looking for a British Pub to watch some EPL or European games in Las Vegas this is the place to go. It's a Gem inside the Riviera Hotel.  Not the best Hotel in Vegas but once you go and find the place you will be surprised.  There is seating outside the place with a TV which I thought it was cool.  Once inside there is a huge panoramic screen where you can watch the game with a bar in the center.  Overall the atmosphere was great as they serve pretty much every beer you can find. I am definately coming back here to watch some Footie if I am in Vegas!!
5	Was in Vegas 3 nights, had dinner here twice and breakfast once!  First night music loud and didnt really match the decore. But food was awesome i had the toad n' hole. Wife had the ?something pasty? It was awesome also.... The gravy is to die for!  Had breakfast there the following morning and dinner again on our last night. Awesome awesome awesome.
5	I recently purchased a Groupon for this restaurant before my husband and I headed to Las Vegas. Thanks to some Groupon bucks, I paid $2 fo $45 worth of food, so I wasn't too concerned about the quality. I figured it was super cheap food and it's a pub, so they've at least got to have a decent burger. But this place delivered!! We went on a Friday afternoon and it was decently busy. There was one waitress working her tail off, and the hostess was doing everything she could to help. Normally I would have docked them a star for the lack of appropriate staff, but their extra effort redeemed themselves. All this before we even got the food!We ordered Scottish eggs for a starter. When the hostess brought them out she apologized that they were out of the special mustard, but she recommended a curried mustard. We obliged and she brought it back. The Scottish eggs were AMAZING.... and the curried mustard was the key! We let her know that she had made a great suggestion!For our lunch, I ordered the Boboti Pie and my husband order the Toad in the Hole. Both incredibly flavorful and you could tell, homemade to perfection! The Boboti pie was a curried beef served with mashed potatoes and vegetables. Neither my husband or I finished all our food because we were stuffed!By the end of our meal, the pub had died down a bit and the waitress spent a good amount of time talking to us about the three owners and their dream of opening an English pub. She was super friendly and had a lot of passion about the food they serve. A diamond in the ruff for sure! Worth walking through the Riviera to find this gem!
3	We went to Queen Vic on a Saturday evening after watching some very entertaining Sin City Roller Girls' roller derby action at the Riviera. The decor of this place makes it look like someone took a real English pub and slapped it onto the side of the Riviera. We had a nice meal of fish and chips with some delicious Boddington's.The service was very adequate at first. The server was friendly and prompt. But when the roller derby let out and filled up the Queen Vic for the after party, he FREAKED OUT. I can understand being a little stressed out, but this was a complete and utter melt down.This is a good place to go to if you already happen to be at the Riviera, but there are a few other British pubs or beer places that have better locations, food and just as good or better beer selection.
3	The first night we stayed at the Riveria we ate here. I had a Corned beef sandwich with too much mustard and the meat was cold, it should have been served hot. WTF?Then my husband had sausage rolls -- delish! He also had fish and chips -- Delish! The 3 dollar soda was FLAT and disgustng. But that was the same way around the whole place. So dont mind it. Dont get a soda, have some bangors!
5	I'm pretty sure this is my new favorite spot in Vegas! I have been here for a loong time and I have been to all the great "local" spots...or I thought I had. My friend and I were hanging out one weekday evening and he said "I'm taking you to the Riv." And my first thought was "okkkkaaaayy the Riv...sooooper..." but as soon as i walked up to this bar I knew we were in for a good time. We sat down and I ordered my usual Jim Beam and diet and wowzers the bartender had a heavy hand...made for a very happy gal! The staff from the bartender to the bar back and the servers were SO personable and engaging. I ended up having an amazing night there and crowned it my new fave spot in Vegas. Later with the Crown and Anchor...Queen Vic it is ;)
5	I had a Groupon for this place so wanted to give it a try since it was near our hotel. First of all, the people working here are super helpful and nice, have awesome recommendations and really do a great job. Food is great, got the shepherds pie and roast beef sandwich. The pies here are great! Super yummy, and normally I'm not sure about food I don't normally eat but these are good! Good beer list with a lot of British beers to try, and my boyfriend said the bloody Mary's were awesome. Overall A+!
3	A few weeks back my family and I were staying at the Riviera and decided to try out the Queen Vic pub for breakfast. To be honest I have had better. The food was decent and the only real thing I liked were the bangers, and that was after we had sent back the overcooked ones. The service was down right rude. It seemed as if they were understaffed; however, that doesn't give a server the right to have attitude. When one of our bangers was served overcooked, we asked for a new one, and the server actually said oh, no its not. I'm paying almost $15 for breakfast, I think I don't think it is to much to ask for it to be served right. Overall so so, prices were a bit much compared to quality.
1	The worst service in the Riviera.  We gave this pub several tries since we had 2 groupon certificates to use & we were in Vegas for Rollercon and this pub hosted some events for Rollercon.Awful, dreadful service.  The food was fine the help was awful.
4	The food was pretty good but the music was seriously blasting out my eardrums.  Just drove for 13 hours, it was 4 am, time to turn the crappy screamo music down. Wish I would have checked the coupon book the riviera gave me before I ate here. There was a good coupon I would have used!
1	PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't think us Brits eat food like this!!Being an Ex-pat, I miss home cooking....so while on a Vegas trip I as recommended to this place....I'll start with the good as it's short and simple...Yes many of our classic and traditional pubs look like this, with the pictures, flags, wooden stools ect..great selection of drinks (they even knew what a snakebite was(not the cocktail)Now the BAD! (moany old man coming out)The menus were very interesting and i thought if the food is any good then they are for sure on a winner.So waited at the door for 10 minutes to be seated in a dead quiet pub (hummm STRANGE ME THINKS)waited 15 minutes to order drinks (even bloody stranger) why the long wait in a pub with maybe MAYBE 3 other people.then drink came with no ice (BUT DAMAN DID'T YOU ASK FOR ICE?) NO the waitress who clearly did not want to be there asked if i would like ICE.(WHAT AND STILL NO ICE) WEIRD!So i thought is this of things to come!YEP!Ordered the food after waiting 30 minutes after the 15 minutes it took to get the drinks. so total time in pub so far 50 minutes and just got drinks and placed food order!i ordered the Sheppard's Pie (should be Lamb in Sheppard's and Beef in Cottage Pie)And my wife ordered the fish and chips.Sheppard's Pie was (beef), Peas were cold and hard as hell, and the chips are NOTHING like British CHIPs.The fish was greasy and over cooked.But we wouldn't  know any of this for another 20 minutes cause that's how long it took! so total time so far: 1 hour and 10 minutes!Had 3 mouthfuls of something that was ment to be a Sheppard's Pie and my wife ate 1 piece of fish and maybe handful of chips.The Manager came over and said she is sorry about the time but the waitress that had be serving us, was due to change shift! OK HANG ON A SEC! She's been serving us for over and hour and she was due to change shift? WHEN? after we leave????As for the food the Manager said it was a new cook!yeah love that excuse!so i pull out my wallet and said oh damn sorry i would like to pay but this is my NEW wallet, so i haven't trained it to hold money yet!!!ok so seriously, i took the bill paid the check total cost $42Total time in PUB: TOO BLOODY LONG
4	Definitely glad I found this place. If you go, make sure you order something that has the gravy, its effing amazing. I'll probably go back just because of it, haha.I had their Bangers and Mash and it was pretty slammin'.-Great pints: They've got nitro so their Guinness and Boddingtons come out great... they even had Kilkenny on nitro too, that was a first for me :D-Rugby: I came in at 2am and saw them hosting a big RWC, Blacks v Pumas, it was good to see a solid amount of people out for the match at the pub too.
4	The mixed reviews made us a little nervous but we were pleasantly surprised. Great food tried the curry chicken pie and fish sandwich both were delicious! Fun ambiance and our service was prefect.
4	I was craving some good beer and a hearty pub meal.. I would normally seek out an Irish pub but while doing a search I came across Queen Vic and was intrigued!  Being local I will sometimes avoid pubs in casinos because they never really have that "pub" vibe, Queen Vic really does feel like a real pub when you enter.   We went in mid-afternoon and the place was quiet but overall somewhat busy, I'd be curious if at dinner time it would be a lot busier/louder.  As for the mrs and I the quiet pub feel was what we were looking for... lots of good import and domestic beers available on tap, some footie on the telly and belly warming food.We did a little research and found a restaurant.com certificate so we saved a little that way and were able to try more of the menu.  We had the British sampler of sausage rolls and my fav Scotch eggs... hands down one of the best Scotch eggs I've ever had on either side of the pond!  For dinner I got the Steak and Kidney Pie which had excellent onion/brown gray to go with it and some very nice puff pastry wrapped around it.  The mrs got the toad in the hole, bangers, onions, brown gravy served inside a very large yorkshire pudding.  All very good indeed. I hate to say negative things when we had such a positive experience because I do think this could become a regular hangout for me but the cost of beer is rather high and I think my Boddingtons was $7.50 for a pint!!!!  It's not that I think I should pay less because I live here and would give them repeat business but at that cost I could not really afford to stop in for a pint a couple of days a week, ya know?  We were informed that locals save 10% on their bills which is awesome, I wonder if that applies to beer? :)
3	Love running into a British pub, but the food was only so so.
4	Beatles cover band + delicious apple/blackberry pastry with ice cream and warm custard + random weird guy hitting on me = a strangely fun timeOh and Boddingtons ale. That pretty much sums up my experience at Queen Victoria Pub.We went here after some sextuple-header roller derby action. We weren't really hungry, but thirsty for some ale and craving some sweets. The apple/blackberry pie totally hit the spot. The crust was perfectly flaky and the custard was absolutely delicious. Boddingtons isn't anything special, but it was on tap, not something I see often, and it felt like the perfect beer for the British pub vibe.And the Beatles cover band was surprisingly good too. The place was a tad loud, especially with the band playing and everything. Also, the server took a while to get our check to us. But overall, I had a fun experience at QVP.3.5 stars
1	ribeye steak = epic failI felt like I was chewing on rubber.  Possibly the worst steak I've ever tasted in my entire life.
5	Five stars for the queen v one for the riviera. It's too bad this great is place is located there. It's a major ordeal to find how to get in and parked. The food and service where very good and reasonably priced the best fish and chips you will have. Shepards pie was great
4	Authentic British food served by British expiats. Queen Victoria's Pub is located inside The Riviera Hotel. There are many British food favorites on the menu like Bangers, Beef and Kidney Pies, and Shepards Pie. However my favorite is the authentic Fish & Chips. They only serve large portions and the Servers are more than happy to split the portions when my friend and I decided to share it. I tell ya, the Fish & Chips taste exactly how I remembered them that last time I visited London.
2	**Summary**       - Flavor - The couple things we ordered seemed very flavorless and dry. I mean, even the quesadilla's are dry.       - Overcooked - The burger and steak were both ordered at medium-rare and came out super dry. Why even give a choice if there's only one way it'll be cooked.       - Ambiance - The place had TVs up and made you feel like you were in a British Pub. The staff were friendly and the decor was **Ordered**       - $8.95 Tandoori Quesadilla - Under appetizer, but it was large enough to be an entree. The whole thing was a bit dry. Cheese wasn't melty at all when you bit into it. I'd prefer Taco Bell's.       - $10.75 Stilton Burger - Ordered at medium-rare, but came at well done. The lack of juiciness made the burger taste bland.       - $26.00 Ribeye Steak - Ordered at medium-rare and also came at well done. Steak had charcoal taste. Steak was chewy and dry.**Recommendations**       - I would not recommend this place for food unless you prefer dry and stale food.
2	It was New Year's Eve and we were at the Riviera to see Vanessa Williams.  We had to get to the Strip early to avoid the driving insanity, so we figured we could get a quick dinner somewhere in the hotel.  We were surprised to see the veddy British-looking Queen Victoria Pub in the midst of the casino clangor, and they were offering their regular menu in addition to the special Jack Up the Prices 'Cause It's New Year's one, so we went for it.  We chose to sit "outside."  Not wanting to eat a full meal, we settled on some sandwiches, and wondered how we'd kill the rest of the time until the 9:30 concert.  It turned out not to be a problem, because after the friendly and efficient waitress took our drink and food orders, the time was spent waiting.  And waiting.  After an hour, our waitress said she just finished screaming at the kitchen, because our sandwiches still weren't ready.  We knew that it wasn't her fault, and now were looking forward to having to bolt the food to get to the concert on time.At long last, the food came, and our sandwiches were okay.  I was happy to be able to get veggies instead of fries, and we finished in time to get to the concert.  The best part, though, was that our wonderful waitress, without us uttering a word, offered to comp the food because of our outrageous wait.  If we ever decide to tackle the insane Riviera parking lot again and return to Queen Victoria again, I hope I'll be able to update this review with a better grade.  The service alone deserves that.
2	So we were in Vegas for Valentine's Day and had gotten a Groupon to go check this place out. I enjoy Groupon and it always gives us the chance to eat at new places, even better when we travel. My Wife ordered a burger which wasn't to bad and I had the special Chicken Pot Pie, which I was not impressed with. It was just okay, but I did like the potatos. The one problem we had was that it got busy in there and there was only 1 waitress handling our area, so service was slow at times for her to make rounds and check on everyone. My wife didn't like the smell in the place and we didn't stay long. Now, they do have plenty of beers on tap and if it was just a guys place to hang out, it would be a great place for that. But, the food just didn't do it for us. The Riveria is an older hotel and like everything in it, can use a little makeover. It's not a place we would return to, if we stayed up in the North end of the strip.
4	best drunk food ever..!!!!!!!!i stumbled in early morning still totally shit faced.. i guess this is a local watering hole cuz it seemed all locals were here.. nice crowd..   waiter was very helpful...i just cant remember what i had because i was so wasted.. but it was good.. i remember that..
4	Good beer selection, makes a good manhattan, the main bar is in the back and quite nice
3	A few glasses of wine and browsing through my Groupons reminded me that I had to burn this deal. Alcohol has a way of wanting the fattiest food and a part of me regrets eating so much, but a tiny part is jumping for joy.I had ordered the Fish and Chips ($15.95) and it was ok. Nothing, spectacular or jump up for joy about. The two filets were a decent size of hearty Icelandic Cod. It comes with the usual sides of tartar sauce and peas. They are a crowd favorite, but not my favorite version. The batter was cooked to a light crisp, but possessed no flavor. Malt vinegar, lemon juice, and tartar was a must. My friend got the Toad in a Hole ($12.95) The sausage and gravy were the best parts of the dish. For dessert, we shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding ($6.25) and it was the best part of the meal. Although the cake was dry, the caramel sauce and ice cream helped moisten it. From other reviews, and my own experience, the desserts are the clear winners in food. I might just come here for sweets next time and go get Indian first.
3	EDIT: They got another chance, and redeemed themselves, for the most part. The servers we had the next two times were great, so I guess the B-crew was on the first day... But watch out! The beer can be expensive.-----We went to the Queen Vic Pub yesterday morning for breakfast. There were an average number of diners; it wasn't packed. Nevertheless, we waited fifteen minutes and a server never stopped to even greet us at our table, much less take a drink order (even though several kept walking thru the room). So, we moved to the bar, where the bartender was only slightly more attentive. We finally ordered and fifteen more minutes later our food arrived. The pancakes and bangers were good, but the veggie samosas were ice cold. I sent them back and just split the pancakes with my girlfriend. Pros: lots of great beers on tap; great atmosphereCons: bad service; so-so food quality, high-ish prices for what you get.Verdict: they'll get another chance. I really want to like the place. Next time I'll just order beer.
5	My room at the Hilton Elara got robbed. They stole it all, except for my smartphone.Which had groupon. Which had a credit card saved. Which meant I could EAT! I bought two for Queen Victoria Pub. The Manager was SO nice, and so understanding, and he let me use TWO groupons for 80$ worth of takeout even when they clearly state 'one per table'. And here I am, asking for takeout. The food was good and served quick. the pickles and tomatos were fresh. And double bagged so I could easily hike alllll the way back to the Elara with 80$ worth of burgers.  Thanks, Queen Vic!
3	Found this cozy little pub inside the Riviera Hotel with a great serving staff. We got the Fish and Chips with excellent flaky cod and crunchy batter. A South African spiced beef Bobotie Pie that leaves a ting in your mouth. Really love the music video showing on the big screen behind the bar.
4	Queen Victoria Pub at The Riviera has some quality British bar food and a nice selection of beer and scotches.  If you're looking for a place for hangover food, this is it.  The meat pies are awesome comfort food, and the sausages (or bangers, apparently) are to die for.  Each meal I've had at the pub came with mashed potatoes, peas and carrots, and a gravy boat.  The portions are substantial.The first time I visited Queen Victoria Pub, the service was poor; the second time, it was above-average.  I'm not sure which is typical of the restaurant,  but hopefully it's the latter.  In any event, it's a good choice if you're near The Riviera.
4	We happened to stop here completely randomly last weekend exploring a side of the strip we never go to, and the Riviera just happened to be the next casino that was out of the sun and heat. We were definitely glad we stopped though, because Queen Victoria Pub was great! Good food, good beer, and I really liked the layout of the place. Definitely a place worth checking out if you are in that neighborhood!
4	Visited several times during our stay at the Riviera.Bar Service - 3Friendly and attentive.  But when it got crowded, service started to slow down and it took a while to get a drink.Table Service - 4Straight up professional, helpful and attentive.Food - 4Shepherd's Pie was very good, fresh, and a huge portion.  A bit heavy on the mashed potatoes, but it worked.  It came with fries, which were excellent, but it became a heavy carbo-load.  A least two could have shared it.  Did like the option of authentic HP sauce.Bloody Mary - 2A bit thin and just tasted like Tabasco sauce.  Would not order again.Beers - 4A good selection of English beers & cider.  I really liked the red ale on Nitro, super creamy.
1	One star is for the Steak and kidney Pie and thats a good score.Service is unbelievably bad. A un- knowledgeable server who did even know what I asked for when I said Ill have a steak and kidney pie chips and curry, she said potato chips? No Chips she said ahhh french fries and she served a cold mayo curry dip?.Dont you think she should know English terms if she works in so called English pub? Sticky toffee pudding was ok but the custard was cold too liquid and full if lumps I know it was microwaved and not well.Im glad i had a Groupon for this muck.Our bill would of been over $40 for lunch 2 entrees and 1 dessert and 2 waters.Very expensive for frozen Fish and Chips, with brown peas and those baby carrots they sell at costco for kids.I cannot stress it enough save your money and go to Mon ami gabi..I also posted my comments on Facebook but they keep getting deleted (strange Huh), I guess the owners dont like the truth about their poor version  of British food
1	YUCK!  We went to this pub because of a groupon.  Between the four of us we ordered 2 appetizers, the Scotch Egg and the Sausage Roll.  For our entrees, we ordered Bangers and Mash, Sausage, Egg & Chips, Lamb Vindaloo, and Shepherd's Pie.  Ths Scotch Egg tastes kind of like a Sausage and Egg McMuffin from McDonald's, except for the muffin.  Not bad, but definitely not special.  The sausage roll, is the same sausage inside a flaky pastry.  Better, but still not great.The sausage (in both meals) was bland and the mashed potatoes were as thick as paste.  The Lamb Vindaloo was not bad tasting.  Unfortunately, it had a lot of rice and potatoes, but only a few small (very small) pieces of lamb.  The Shepherd's Pie was lacking of any and all spices.Overall - never again!  We have been to many British pubs (some in England), and this wasn't anywhere near where it should be.The prices were high for the amount of food served (if the food was good - which it really wasn't).  The service was fair - but it took quite a while to get refills on our drinks.We didn't bother with dessert (which is spelled wrong on their online menu) there.  We went somewhere that we knew would be good dessert.
2	Kind of a dive place with mediocre food that is a bit overpriced. I would not recommend this place.
5	Delicious, large portions. The chicken curry was amazing!
4	English food and dining can be so bland but let me tell you I haven't enjoyed myself  more than the late lunch I had at the Queen Vic. Service was attentive and friendly. More so the Sausage Rolls and Scotch Eggs were tastes I have not had since I lived in Vancouver 30 years ago. We shared Steak an Kidney pie and it blew us away. The pastry dough was light and scrumptious. The meat in the light gravy sauce was right on the money. We also had to share the fish and chops. Although the beer batter was just lightly soft, the Icelandic cod was very high quality. Excellent selection of beers although we only had one each as we were well stuffed. The Riviera was not as worn down as I was expecting but definitely gave the full experience of late 60s early 70s Vegas!In summary, try the English Pub food. You will be as surprised at the dining experiences as we were
2	The service was slow and uninterested. They weren't even that busy. We went because I'd bought a groupon and it was about to expire. We went in the later part of the morning around 11 and we sat on the "patio" which is basically sitting on the casino floor. There wasn't even any english or pub music playing. Instead we got a clash from the slot machines and some pump it up CD. The portions were pretty good sized and I guess the food was authentic. The menu had some interesting options on it. I can't see why on earth I would go back but, if I do I'll make sure that i've cleared my calendar for the rest of the day!
3	Located in the Riveria, If you find yourself at the end of the strip this place actually has a good breakfast.
1	Thank god that I had a groupon for here because I would not be to trilled if I had to pay the full price. The food was ok but I server was just not on top of things. I think that's what made me not want to return here.
4	Had fish and chips...pretty pricy, but good. I had a coupon which helped. Kind of a pain to get to since its in a casino and you have to park in the garage, but I guess you could valet. Anyway, it's worth a try if you are looking for good fish and chips.
3	A solid place to eat if you stay at the Riviera.  Just a typical bar type menu with some Brit specialties.  I ate here almost everyday for lunch while at a convention at the Riviera.  The food choices are limited at this hotel, but the price was fair at the Queen Victoria.  The food was good, and the staff was courteous.  Good price as even bar food can be expensive in Vegas hotels.
1	Had the fish and chips and the Aussie meat pie and a few tap beers.Fish was shaped (frozen?) and very bland (and 16 bucks!), chips were pretty good. the meat pie was OK, but the mashed potatoes were horrible and the gravy was gelatinous (from a can?) .  We will not be back.
3	The potential of this place is amazing, but unless I'm consistently visiting at the slowest times possible, this place is falling short of what it could be. The beer and whiskey selection is pretty decent, the atmosphere and decor is very "English ...Pubbish" and is huge compared to most pubs I visiting in my last trip to England.The menu was blah and from what I saw of the food, it was too...again very much what I remembered of pubs in England. The waitress was energetic and fun without being bubbly and annoying.the prices however are a tad high tho. $9.00 for a New Castle plus tip was enough to stop drinking for a bit.I will give this place one more try in the near future, so if anyone knows a "good night" to visit please just let me know. I would much rather raise my rating and enjoy myself more next time.
2	Sub par food and service to match, glad I came here on a groupon. Will never come back, just stick to Crown and Anchor if you're getting British food. Bangers and mash were terrible and the gravy was probably microwaved Swansons TV dinner leftovers. The fish and chips are good if you don't care much for your arteries. Place might be good if you've had around 10 or so beers.
4	This was a rather enjoyable pub. I did have the good fortune of timing and expectations, so I can see why some people would be a bit frustrated.The bar itself is slow but friendly. It's a nice place to down a few beers and watch some soccer peacefully. The food is enjoyable if rather common. The meat pies are absolutely solid although the sides are pretty average.I will warn everyone right now that the price of a pint is ludicrous. I know any bar in a hotel is going to be overpriced, but that was just silly. Still, that apart, I just enjoyed the place. If you're looking for a quick meal, this isn't the place to go. It's a great spot to sit back, slow down, and enjoy a drink and perhaps some food while Vegas hurries on outside.
4	We love this place.  Its great to see a good quailty food place at the Riv since there are very few there anymore.   The food was excellent.  I had some of the best roast chicken I have ever had there and the chips with the curry dipping sauce were excellent.  We also tried some of the english fare which was equally as good.  bobotie was good but a little rich for my blood.  My bf had the meat pie and he said it was good but again a little too rich for our american palettes.   We also tried the scotch eggs which were quite different from the ones we get from Growlers at home.  I think they are more american having had these eggs at two engligh pubs now.    We love that htis place is open 24 hrs and have no doubt we will be back on our next trip to Vegas.
2	My boyfriend and I had an early lunch here because of a coupon we got when we checked into the Riviera. It was quite busy, but they seated us pretty quickly. Service was incredibly slow after that. We saw a server only when she took our order and brought it to us. We had to ask for the check after not being checked on for some time. I could excuse this, but we were sitting right in front of the hostess station. There is no reason not to offer a refill on our waters!Honestly, the food (veggie burger and turkey club, both with fries) was mediocre and even with the coupon I feel like I paid way too much for it. I know everything is overpriced in Vegas, but still. Not worth it.
4	The pub has a nice vibe, cool music, and great service. Our food was pretty good. A little heavy/greasy... but we really enjoyed ourselves!
3	Was at the Riviera because GF was playing a pool tournamentLate night and didnt really want to go around finding food so we decided to stay in the hotelDont expect much from the decor because honestly the whole hotel is old so the restaurant is no differentTook a while for someone to come over so we just seated ourselvesStaff was friendlyshe ordered a regular cheese burger with coleslawi ordered a bacon western burger with side of french fries.PRETTY DAMN BIG BURGERSboth came with a slice of pickletheir slaw was pretty good, best i've had in a whiletheir fries were cut too big for my tastethe onions that came with my burger was over fried so it was all shriveled upoverall both burgers were pretty tastynot bad for a "late night random no where else to go" eats
2	HORRIBLE SERVICE. Good food, nice beer selection. Waitresses are rude and not knowledgeable about menu or drink selections. if there are more than 4 tables already filled, skip it. Kathleen especially rude and unhelpful.
4	It was a slow Sunday evening and it was rainy out so my main squeeze and I had the bar to ourselves. Owing to the lack of clientele we were able to try just about any beer we wanted before settling into a pint. The bartender at QV pub introduced me to Innis & Gunn Cask Ale. It's aged in barrels that were once used to age rum. Do you understand how good that makes a beer taste? Next time I am on the north end of the Strip, I'm stopping in for a pint of that ale!
3	Come because you have a coupon. Stay because there's a lot of beer.This faux English pub is nestled in the corner of Riviera's casino floor. I was excited to go there because there was a buy one get one coupon. There are actually coupons for this place all around the Riviera. Make sure you grab some before you head to the pub. Because the beer prices are pretty high. The average beer is around $7 to $8. So you can cut that in half with a coupon. There are around 100 different draft and bottle choices. Obviously a lot of English beer choices. I'm not a big fan of dark heavy beer, but that's what was mostly available. Also, the advertisements make it seem like this bar has 100 beers on draft, but its not the case.I had the fish and chips, which were pretty average. I thought the meal was going to be a lot better, so I was a little disappointed. The service was also average. The bartender appeared to have no clue about any of the beer he was serving. He told a patron that were only English beers at the bar. He said this while pouring beer of of a Dogfish Head tap. Overall, this place is just alright.
