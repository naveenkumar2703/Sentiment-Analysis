3	Baja Miguel's reminds me of Don Miguel's restaurant in the Orlean's hotel. (anything catchy in the names ???) In fact, the entire Southpoint Hotel reminds me of the Orlean's - just newer.  Both Hotels the same room layouts which are really quite large and nice. And .... they have exactly the same type Mexican restaurant. I really like the service at Baja Miquels much better and they do have quite a display of Margaritas. The food is very good. They will bring you as many bowls of chips and salsa as you can handle.The Margaritas are quite tasty.If you stay at the hotel there are a couple of coupons that make your dining stay a bit lighter in the wallet, however the prices are very resonable for the portion size.A very nice, very average Mexican restaurant.
2	My wife and I are Vegas locals and Mexican food is a favourite. When South Point opened its new Mexican restaurant we had to give it a try, especially as it is only a short drive.The first thing I noticed about Baja Miguel's is that it looks more like a cafe than a Mexican restaurant. The colours, decor and layout of the tables doesn't make for the most intimate setting.Before our meal we were given Salsa, bean dip and guacamole. I can't comment on the guac since neither of us like it - The salsa was good but the bean dip was revolting.I ordered the shredded beef nachos and my wife had cheese enchiladas.  The best way I can describe the food is "Pedestrian" - sort of like what you would expect at a chain restaurant.  The beef on my nachos was a bit sloppy and my wife described her food as "ok, but nothing id ever crave again".In a city with so many cheap Mexican options, give Baja Miguel's a big miss. The food is OK, but when you have similarly cheap fare all over town, usually of much higher quality, I don't see any reason to go here again.On the plus-side, drink service was sensational and the staff looked after us well.
4	Baja Miguel's was a nice surprise!  Hidden away on the second floor inside South point Casino, Baja Miguels is a good choice for a nice Mexican lunch or dinner.  When they bring out the chips, they come with a combination of salsa, guacamole, and sour cream.  They have some great lunch time specials which include soup, an entree, and a Margarita.  The food was great and the prices were very reasonable.  The atmosphere was OK.  The service was above average.  Overall, 4.25 stars.
2	Food: 3.5 StarsService: 0 starsI ate here while staying at South Point Hotel in Vegas and was quite disappointed by the way my meal turned out. The food was pretty decent with the hearty portions and a killer chips and dip, but the service was dreadful. We waited forever to order our food and didn't get our water until mid-way through the meal. Our waiter kept apologizing for how slow the service is (clearly a bad sign) and in the end we just gave the bill to the bus boy after waiting forever for our waiter. I would not recommend this place.
4	We actually had a decent meal here at baja miguel's the other day. They have a daily lunch special from 11-3 daily that includes a frozen margarita, fideo soup, and your choice of two items to make up your entree that comes with rice and beans. The chips and salsa also come with bean dip and guac. I think its actually a pretty good deal if you are close by and especially since the special is seven days a week.
3	Decent casino mexican food - full disclosure: they gave me a free margarita with my lunches. Do not go during peak times if you value your gambling time at all. I went here for lunch on a few occasions and the service is unreasonable slow and inattentive. If you are going to make your customers wait, then make sure their glasses are full.Standard mexican food, but the rice and beans tasted pre-prepared. Everything else was good for the price I paid - less than $10
5	Best lunch value in Las Vegas. You are served chips and 3 different dips (bean, salsa and avocado). Then out comes Fideo soup. You get to choose 2 items (Tacos - crispy or soft shell, Burritos or Chili Relleno). The meat can be beef (shredded or ground), pork or chicken. You also get a Margarita included with your lunch. Since I have to return to work, I always ask for a Virgin Strawberry Margarita. One of my favorite place to eat!
4	I love Baja Miguel's for lunch.  They have a lunch special for $8.95, which consists of two items, beans and rice, fideo soup, and a margarita (or substitute drink).  Since I am usually here during my work lunch break, I get a virgin margarita, which is still delicious.  They also bring out chips and dip pretty much as soon as you sit down.
5	baja miguels in southpoint hotel casino is one of las vegas best mexican restaurants the prices are cheap and the food is plenty the chips and dips are a delight always hot and fresh there food is always spot on try baja miguels you taste buds will thank you
3	The fish tacos rock here as they're grilled orange roughy. The fact they give you great guac before your meal is fantastic also.
2	I would have given this place my first one star rating if it wasn't for the free lime Margarita with salt (free with lunch special) - It's making my mouth water just thinking about it... 1st star- It's free / 2nd star- It's lime with salt around the rim =2 stars!!!The first clue to me as to if a Mexican restaurant will be good or not is if the tortilla chips and flour tortillas are good, I mean if a Mexican restaurant can't get these 2 regular items correct then I know the rest of the food will most likely not taste good and as always I was right...There is not much taste in any dish that I have tried there(because of my parents I have eaten there a few times). The last thing I tried was Pollo Baldastano ( Chicken breast stuffed with ham & cheese then ovenbaked with a pepper sauce) - Sounds hellah good huh? Well it tasted like cafeteria food... Don't expect too much from this place - I don't...
3	Do I even need to state that I wanted Mexican food on this trip??  Ahhhh it's a sickness, I can't help it!  Actually, it's an addiction I never want to cure if you want me to be honest.......::sigh::... stranded at South Point, really wanting Mexican food, chillin solo, I found this the perfect opportunity to try Baja Miguel's.  I was unsure of it because the last Mexican restaurant in here was pretty blaaaah.  However, I would never know how this one tasted unless I went.  Located towards the back of the casino and up the stairs, I finally found Baja Miguel's. "Oh it's just me ...::smiles::..." "Ok, the wait is 20 minutes." "What?! 20 minutes for ONE person??" "Yea" "...::sighs in disbelief::... alright I guess"As I'm waiting, I see about eight of my friends coming out. Ahh why didn't you tell me yall foos were eating here?! ..::sad face as stomach growls::...20 minutes roll around and I am finally seated..... at the first booth at the entrance. DANG I didn't want EVERYONE to know I was eating alone ...::starts texting to look occupied and as if I don't care::... A nice lady came and brought me chips, salsa, guacamole, and refried beans and took my drink order.  I really only like guacamole with taquitos so I just tried a bit.  The salsa was whatever, not the best I've had but certainly not the worse either.  My server came and I order tortilla soup FIRST and then the chicken enchilada with green sauce combo.  Yea, yea I got enchiladas, FTW!!!My server comes back in about 15 minutes with my enchildas and it looks pretty good.  I look up to him and say: "My tortilla soup? :)""You ordered soup?""Yea I did ...::I actually ordered that first to be honest::...""...::looks at order receipt::... No you didn't, do you want it?""...::Yea I did::... oh alright, no that's ok then :/"So to sum up my solo experience at Baja Miguel's, it just was what it was.  I would call it decent.  Enchiladas and beans were pretty good but the rice was bland and not so much.  Clearly not the best I've ever had. If you aren't staying at the South Point and have access to a car, USE IT!  if you're stranded like me and have a fixin for Mexican food, suck it up, Baja Miguel's will do.
3	Baja Miguel's has some good Mexican at an okay price. Not the best Mexican food I have ever had, but certainly not the worst. The tray of dipping items is nice and their guacamole is good. The wait time can get lengthy the later you wait to go. It's best to get there earlier in the evening. The hostess we had was very rude. She acted as if we were imposing on her time by even coming. Our waitress was nice, but never seemed to be around. My husband's glass was empty twice and we had to ask for the refills. Again, the food is good but don't expect exceptional service.
2	We ordered the $8.95 luncheon special that includes a margarita, fideo soup and a 2-item combination.  We went with a traditional margarita on the rocks and chile relleno/enchilada for our combo.  The margarita and soup were good, but Miguel's interpretation of Tex-Mex was pretty typical (e.g. mediocre) for a casino eatery.
5	re-fried beans are AMAZING! even if i was not staying at this hotel, i would come, order a large side of the beans and chips to go and be a happy happy girl. the kicker is, i don't even usually like beans ! :)
4	Food was great. I am new to Vegas and been to a few Mexican joints that were not good. This place had really good food. Chips, salsa, guach, bean dip to start. I had 2 enchiladas, chicken and cheese, and a chicken Taco. Too much food, but can't wait for my left overs at home. Ambiance needs help. If you didn't know the food was good you would swear it wasn't by looking at the yellow walls and wacky carpet. Will definately go back.
3	**Summary**       - Lunch Special - They have a lunch special for $8.95 Wednesday through Sunday. It's a really good deal and includes a drink (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg?select=1m4c2eotnlfsD3whZLohoA).       - Chips and Dips - You're given a chips with beans, salsa, and guacamole (all house made) when you're seated. You can see the chunks of avocado in the guac. It's delicious (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg?select=qP5qEupOH8WAHq0wXYHgdw).       - Fideo soup - You receive fideo soup with almost every order. It's a salty tomato based soup with angel hair pasta in it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg?select=c_Fo6l5F1uAeLg0MWAWbDQ).**Ordered**       - $14.95 Rib-eye Skillet - The steak was juicy but had a tomato flavor that I didn't believe steak should have (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg?select=w3lbn27Wn_UTSDAlGJiRQw).       - $12.95 Carne Asada - Skirt steak was a bit thin. It had a charcoal flavor that was pretty tasty (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg?select=th7JTCiLmeIyUF9F9oxgQg).**Recommendations**       - The chips and dip you get at the beginning of your meal is half the reason I go here. I don't care too much for the soup and the Mexican food is decent.
3	Not bad, not outstanding. If I was staying there I'd eat there again. I wouldn't drive far to sample the place. But if you're close it will do!Decor is really cheesy, like I'm on a cruise ship cheesy.
4	I am actually very surprised at all the not so great reviews of this place, I know that initial reaction is, " Oh Raymond, you must not know good Mexican when it slaps you in the face." My response is this, " the food can't be good if its slapping you in the face and I really do know me some Mexican food. This was one of those places that we pass all the time when walking to the movie theater or the players club and have not given it a second thought. One Sunday we were on our way home from our church that is on Dean Martin and my wife was craving Mexican food so I decided we should hit the one in the southpoint.We walked into the southpoint and headed to our buddy Miguels, The lady at the door/counter seated us and off we went. One of the servers brought us the starters, I obviously expected chips and salsa but instead we received Chips, Salsa, Guacamole and bean dip, Whoa hold the train here, " Um, I did not order this" I know sir it comes with the meal.. Yes, Miguel scored. we then cracked open the menu and see the amazing combo, $8.95 for two items, Fideo, beans, rice and a Drink, yes this means alcoholic drink and we are not talking bills gambling hall .99 margaritas these are adult sized. The food came out and everything on my plate was awesome, from the beans to the taquitos, it was all hot and fresh and tasted as authentic as you could expect at a casino Mexican joint. If it was in my kitchen that would be a different story. But for $8.95 you just cant beat it.  The service was great, the food was great and it definitely makes you want to return.
4	It's in the South Point Casino.  That said, you really shouldn't be expecting some grand, authentic Mexican experience.  Baja Miguel's is one of my favorites - and who'd have thunk it?!?First off, the starting chips & dip...I can't even.  I crave that bean dip at least once every week.  It is so amazing!  The guac & salsa that accompany it are both good as well, but the bean dip is where it's at.  In fact, I would be happy with a couple margaritas and that dip, but I don't know when to say when, so I always overdo it with the dining and end up full and feeling like a stuffed pig.Which means, of course, I love their entrees.  I usually get seafood enchiladas or the burrito carbon but everything else looks tempting and tasty.  Like I said, I wouldn't call it an "authentic" experience, but it's really, really good.
1	I was staying at the South Point and love Mexican food so based on reviews selected this place.  Everything about it was horrible.  The decor is cheesy diner/cafe style; there is no ambiance whatsoever.  The elderly male host was almost single handedly the most rude restaurant employee I've ever encountered.  The salsa was ok however the food in general was bland and the margaritas were watered down.  Complete waste of money and time.
4	Yummy yummy!!  Recently moved to Vegas, this is the only real sit down Mexican Food Restaurant we have found!  The bean dip, guacamole, and salsa with chips is outstanding!  Parradillas Del Norte was SO GOOD!  Chimichanga delicious!!  Highly recommend, good atmosphere, good music, great service!!
4	Baja Miguel's is one of Las Vegas' best kept secrets.  Located on the second floor of Southpoint casino and hotel, it has always provided fresh, tasty food and very rarely have we had to wait.  They start with a first class chip and tri-fecta of dips, guacamole, hot bean and medium salsa.  Today I was treated to carnitas and my girlfriend went with the tried and true chile rellano.  Her dish was excellent, as usual.  While I've been pleasantly surprised in the past with the beef and chicken dishes, today's faring was a bit dry, if not tasty.  The pork portions were good sized for the price and the rice and beans were a nice side.  The service has always been challenging at this venue.  While not necessarily slow, the servers seems to have a chip on their shoulder and almost act bored.  The one standout today was the busboy.  He was quick, efficient, polite and friendly.  I had a flashback that they could have used a bit of Ricardo Montalban in Fantasy Island, when he says, as the plane approaches, "Smile, everyone, Smile!".
4	Very affordable for south of the strip!I had the Milanesa Cazadores, which was breaded chicken with jumbo skrimpies on top. Delicious and the serving was gargantuan. Dude had the Parrillada del Norte, which was pork, steak and grilled chicken. BOMB BOMB BOMB! Serving size was also big.We were served chips with salsa, guacamole and these wonderful beans! Yum!Definitely coming back here when I want to get away from the buffets!
3	Just got back from the first time there, on Cinco De Mayo. As you will see in several reviews, the decor of the room is not much. It comes off mostly like a banquet or meeting room that had some light conversions to make it a restaurant. Anyway-the food. They had a couple of special going-shrimp tacos or carne asada steak and chees enchilada. The enchilada was not good. Dry, no sauce, not much flavor. The carne asada however, was about as good as I could imagine--lot's of good flavor. My wife had the shrimp tacos and kind of gave them an 'ehhh'. Overall, three stars for me. A sign of a great restaurant for me is ---would I pass by like restaurants to go to this one'. For me, the anwer is no.
5	Several friends and I went to Baja Miguel's Saturday for Cinco de Mayo. Everyone at our table raved about the food and the huge portions. I had the combo plate consisting of a  beef taco, beef enchilada with sides of Spanish rice and refried beans. Massive amount of food and every bit of it perfectly done.  The Albondigas Soup, which  has always been a favorite of mine is just so-so here so skip it.  The dishes came out very hot and no one had any complaints whatever. Just a word about bean dip that comes out as you're seated:  AWESOME!!  We could have made a meal out of that dip and chips.  There is a guacamole and red salsa along with the bean dip but who noticed??   The service here is terrific.  This was my first time here but certainly won't be my last.
1	Baja Miguel's has been a local favorite of our family for about 7 years and we've been steady customers.  We've always enjoyed the food for the value and we've referred countless friends to the restaurant.  We ate there tonight for an early Father's Day celebration.  We were shocked to learn that when we requested more chips and salsa, we'd be charged $7.95 for the next round.  Huh?  Then my mom requested a little extra lettuce with her taco and she was informed that would cost $1.75.  At that we asked for the manager.  We have never incurred such charges before and the manager, who was not the regular manager we're accustomed to dealing with, told us they have been charging for those items for a long time.  Wrong!  We have never once been charged for extra chips and salsa or for a little extra lettuce.  Although we enjoyed our meals, to the tune of $80 with tip for 4, I don't think we'll be coming back here any time soon.  I understand times are tough, but come on!  We're not the type of folks who complain about paying money for decent food and we tip well.  But when a restaurant starts being so tight about every little item, it takes the fun out of going there.  Too bad.
4	whenever I see a place like this with outdated signs and seating, I am hesitant. I wasnt sure if his restaurant could serve good food. Despite the restaurant reminding me of the Golden Girls trip to Mexico kind of decor, they actually serve decent food. Nothing is dry or tasteless, which is a huge plus. I doubt the salsa, beans and guac they serve free is made fresh, but its still nice to eat. I tried their shredded chicken tacos and they are large, juicy, and flavorful. Two people coukd eat one order.  Overall, its a fun change from the casino level eats.
5	Its not about the atmosphere really. Its the food!! They give you comp chips with guacamole, salsa, and bean dip. All so very good! Wed-Sun they have a $9.95 lunch special that includes a 2 item combo, fideo soup (also yum!!), and a frozen margarita! You cant beat that.
1	The avocado shrimp dish was delish but I was really upset with their service. When I walked up I told them I needed it to go. She said fine but I had to sit down and then ask for a to go box and said while I wait they serve  chips. The chips never came so when they brought the plate of food and the to go box for me to transfer the food to I asked for some chips that I would have gotten while waiting. They said hou don't get the chips when itsqto go, same price for the meal  it no chips. They went and asked someone else and came back and   and said again no chips. I couldn't believe the rudeness. Over 50 cents of chips. I had to go to the casino gift shop and spend $4 for a bag of chips to go with my Mexican .meal!
4	Mexican food has to be so-so because it is in an off strip casino right?  NO!Since I can remember, I have had Mexican food all over So Cal and enough food in Mexico (away from tourist traps) to say that I was surprised at how good it was.The service and the place itself is standard.  As far as the food, the flavor and freshness of the ingredients starts with the complimentary appetizers and goes right through all the dishes.  The fish tacos I had were delish, the side dish stuff--beans and rice, were good by themself.  The carnitas was absolutely delish.  Massive portions and with good flavor.  I have had them made in La Puente CA were they were great eventhough they were cooked in lard (lard makes it Hell for those on a diet, but "true" to its Mexican origin, and does a lot for the taste in a good way).  This did not have that deep fried coating--more like it was pressure cooked and tender, but still had the right pan-cooked taste.  It was just good with a nice flavor profile.For the price, you can't beat it.
5	The food was EXCELLENT! And service was great! I will definitely go back
3	Our department decided to try this place for dinner after a fun time of bingo. The restaurant was filled to the gills with cowboys because of NFR, but they were able to find us a table even though we were an hour early for our reservation. The service was pretty good. Our drinks were refilled often. The food wasn't fantastic, although I didn't have very high expectations of the place. The chips and salsa were pretty disappointing. Totally flavorless. Everyone added tapatio to it to for more flavor. I ordered the pork adobo and it was ok. Nothing amazing, but it was edible. I only ate about a quarter of it and didn't feel I had missed anything. The rest of my party was pretty disappointed with their food. They know I Yelp and asked what I would rate the place and each of them gave their own star rating. I have to say most of them said two star, but I give kudos for the good service and since I actually thought my meal was ok. I rounded up for the attentive and accommodating service.
4	The food here is surprisingly good.  We had low expectations after trying the chips and salsa.  The salsa and guacamole are bland and boring and we don't end up eating them, but I thought the bean dip was addictive. My husband had the fajitas and the beef was really well seasoned.  I have had the carne asada tampiquena which was good, as well as cheese enchilada and pork tamale which I also enjoyed. They went a little masa heavy on the tamale but the meat was great. Wish they would improve their salsa, for sure, but we will definitely return.
1	For the first time in my entire life, I instructed my party NOT to leave a tip and they reacted by counting out COINS so that we could pay the bill for this would-be meal and ensure that the wait staff was aware that we hadn't forgotten a tip, but simply that they had not earned one from us.We had a party of four meeting up at this location to grab a quick bite before our movie began at 7:00.  Two of us showed up first and were brought to our seats.  An older gentleman came up to our table and asked for our drink orders...and then a younger gentleman came up a minute later for our drink orders.  I informed him that we had already been helped and thanked him.  After a few minutes, our original server brought out our drinks and a basket of tortilla chips with a tray or salsa, bean dip and guacamole to munch on.  This is one of the things I love about Mexican food restaurants, it's their version of a bread basket and it works so well, for me, because I love salsa and chips.After about ten more minutes, another of our party showed up and the same thing happened as before.  Older gentlemen gets her drink order and then the younger one does the same thing.  I'm curious, are they really so overstaffed that they need two people to check up on each other or are they just unaware of which sections each is supposed to cover?  No matter, since we were splitting the bill and crunched for time (and our fourth party was stuck in traffic), we order two appetizers to split.  After we ordered, my best friend noticed that our salsa, bean dip and guacamole was almost empty and the older gentleman was at our table so she asked him to send us a new one.  He looked directly at her as she made the request and then just turned around and walked away.  She gave his retreating back a funny look and then noticed that the younger gentleman was about to pass our table and stopped him for the same request.  He got a very nervous looks on his face, shook his head and informed us that this wasn't his section and he'd send our server over.  Really?  Then why were you asking for our drink orders and serving the two tables to the left and right of us?The older server came out with his stern face in place and snidely informed my best friend that only the first bowl of salsa and dip is free, afterwards he would have to charge us $7.95.  Just so that everybody is aware, that's the price of an appetizer at this location.  My friend literally laughed at him and waved him away after I had informed him that this would be our once and only visit to this restaurant.  It amazes me that $7.95 is worth the loss of what might have been a repeat customer.After we ate, the older server handed us our bill of $25.30 and my two companions literally counted out 25 dollars and three dimes while I wrote on the note that they should be on the lookout for my upcoming one star yelp review and that the service was so horrible that I would not be back.  Three servers saw that I was writing on the bill and pointed us out in front of the restaurant while they whispered vehemently about us.  To top everything off, the server came and snatched up what we had left before we were even out of the booth and gave us a cold sneer for our "generosity."  It's actually a crying shame that I won't be back to this restaurant, especially in a town like Las Vegas where there can't be that many more Mexican food restaurants that would be willing to bestow decent service on a paying customer...right?
3	I wasn't expecting much when I walked in, but the food was pretty good. Everyone at my table preferred the bean dip over the salsa && guac, but neither were bad. We all ordered tacos, which were good. I also had a pork tamale which was okay, and a taste of the shrimp ceviche was also decent. A few gripes, the floor was dirty, our servers were not the friendliest, but not terrible, and they don't have anything a la carte.
4	This place has great mexican food, as well as steak, chicken and believe it or not, fantastic chicken fettucini.  i am a mexican food junkie, and this is one of the best.
1	Wow...I mean...wow.4 of us sat down at a booth, as the guy brings the chips and salsa I requested an extra salsa so we didn't need to reach. He responds by saying only one is complimentary....Are kidding me? We all order our meals and then we noticed the lunch special which tossed in a margarita and some fideo soup and were bummed we didn't see it sooner. The server comes out with our soup and margaritas and says she ran em through as the special to take care of..kudos to young lady.The soup was a the typical cheapo tomato juiced wannabe soup. Wasn't horrible, just not special. I think it is sold in 50 gallon barrels as I swear I have experienced that before several times.The margarita, was a limeade slushy. Absolutely 0 tequila.When the food came out we had everything from shredded chicken tacos, to Diablo seafood, to chile relleno.The Relleno was like a soggy egg pancake, the chicken was as bland as could be. I mean, even if you cook chicken plain it has more flavor than that. The scallops of the seafood diablo were chewy and fishy so I am guessing frozen, then thawed too early, then served.This food was redic. Do not go here. On a positive note, the server was awesome and was still tipped very well.
3	This place is ok, its better than most of the other Southpoint restaurants. I'd go there again but I wouldn't be all excited over it either. The food and service is ok, acceptable to good. Never excellent in our experience. Typical Mexican fare, nothing to go out of your way for.  I heard some items do not have free refills or are too expensive so please ask all questions before ordering and do not assume anything. The lunch special is worth it, dinner isn't worth the extra cash you'll be paying.
4	we eat here every time we stay at South-point hotel..love the trio of bean dip, guac and salsa, with the fresh basket of chips..The bean dip is so addicting, that we almost have to wrestle the grand kids to get our share..this last time we just got more! I always order the shredded beef crispy taco meal, and am never disappointed...the free margarita coupon is a plus, as I like mine over the rocks instead of frozen...service is always good, and so is the food....give it a try when in Vegas!
4	Went here strictly because of the DEFTAL tequila session event. Nice event! They had a strolling Mariachi band, a DJ, 5 different types of tequila's, 4 types of beers and a snack station. Chips w/ salsa, guac and quesadilla. Oh did I mention it was a 7 - 10 pm event that was completely free!How cool it was however I only stayed about an hour not a big drinker and being new to town no friends to take or meet me there so I was in saw it had a 3 shots and a beer...Don Julio reposado, one from Jilsco owned by George Clooney, Patron Anejo and Negra Modela and went home. It was a very nice event!
3	The wet chicken burrito and chimichanga are my go to menu items and the bean dip is outrageous!The warm chips and dip trio is definitely worth the trip every time!Baja Miguel's is worth checking out one Saturday night...perhaps before you catch a movie.
4	My boyfriend and I ate here last Saturday night, while staying at South Point for the first time. South Point isn't a great hotel, but it sure does off a variety of very inexpensive restaurant options, including Baja Miguel's.I was generous with my rating, because my boyfriend thought that the Shrimp Diablo dish was the best Mexican food that he has ever eaten. Ever! He definitely wants to come back here. I had a shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada combo. It was good, but nothing extra special. It certainly wasn't something that would make me want to rush back.They do make great tortilla chips that are very light and salty, served with a dipping trio of salsa, beans and guacamole. Very good.I have several margaritas at the bar during our trip and they were strong and cheap.My biggest impression of South Point was the inexpensive food and alcohol. Stay here and feast for pennies. Seriously great values to be had and most of the food was good too. The decor looks like something from a cruise ship, especially the bar outside of the restaurant. Garish color scheme and just bad design. The restaurant was also kept ridiculously cold and I spent the meal shivering.Friendly, lightening fast service.
1	Ate here while staying at the South Point.  Well, at least it was priced reasonable.  Other than that it was nothing to write home about...at all!  The service was very poor (slow and kind of rude).  The food was not really good at all.  It didn't make us sick or anything, and it did fill us, but it just wasn't good.  But hey, when you are stuck at the casino, what are you going to do?
4	We love this place! I ordered the cheese enchilada plate with a coke and my husband ordered a bean and cheese burrito wet. Shortly after ordering the waiter comes to me and brings a bowl of soup and says my order was on special and it comes with soup for 8.99. GREAT!! The food was fantastic. The right flavors and temperatures. We were also given when we sat down chips and a trio of salsa, bean dip and guacamole. Sooooo Yummmy. Just have to minor complaints. The restraunt is always warm especially when it is very HOT outside you want to have it cool. Also the are closed Mon and Tues!! I am off on the then and want to go in so it is hard for me to always come cause of my work schedule.Give this place a try great food and most of the time great staff.
4	Best Mexican food on Las Vegas Blvd . My family  dines here  twice a month. The complimentary chips dips and salsa are great. The service is always quick. Located in The South Point Casino .
4	Nice open seating and very attentive staff ( we were there early when they opened and the traffic was light). Nice menu choices and standard pricing on most items. Food was served timely and the Fajitas (shrimp) was too hot to eat which is how it should be served.Our first time there but probbaly not our last.
5	OMG this is the best Mexican food and restaurant ever! I love it all the service the margarita free with lunch 10 bucks for 2 item rice beans soup and margarita! where on earth can u go get that and it all taste so good I went twice this trip. Love it all
3	I was really excited about the happy hour at the bar just outside the restaurant. So after hitting the sauce for awhile. We decided we should probably eat something. It is definitely not my favorite Mexican restaurant. But it was far from the worst too. Service and food was quick and friendly. And I am sure if I am in the mood for Mexican? And don't want to leave the hotel I will eat here again.
4	Being a local here, this place is not too bad. Prices are reasonable and portions are great. As other reviewers have said, the chile relleno was much like an eggy pancake with a small chile inside that was not stuffed with cheese. Was not good at all. But the rest of our meal was great and filing, the complimentary chips with salsa, bean dip & guac was tasty. And a refill for the dips is not $7-8 as another reviewer complained, it's only $2. The margarita needs some improvement, add a lil tequlia to it. The servers were quick, attentive and kept our drinks filled.  We will definitely be back
5	Very surprised and pleasantly so! Came in late from the airport and decided to grab a bite and this place was inside our hotel, South Point.The food was excellent and although the staff was not overly friendly, they were very good and we thoroughly enjoyed the food!
3	Your basic mass produced Mexican food. The waiter's face, Vincente, turned all twisted crazy when I asked for the veggie burrito in corn instead of a flour tortilla. Then oh duh ma'am just get the veggie fajitas with corn instead of flour tortillas. He was so unwittingly rude it was comical. For real, he was clueless. The margaritas were pretty darn good.....that or the fact I've been in "i need a drink" mode since Tuesday night with CES trade show madness and all liquor sounds dreamy.It was ok food.Silverware was really clean.
2	Blah. Lots of food. Lots of really bland food. Salsa was flavorless. Mashed beans masquerading as refried bean dip. And the soup tastes like a wet dog smells. Howard Johnson style decor. Chipotle is better, and that is saying a lot. Second the opinions on the the weird tag teaming service.
4	I like the free fideo soup and free margaritas Wednesday through Sunday from 11:00am to 5:00pm.  Yummy.
4	The lunch special is a fantastic deal! Wednesday through Sunday from 11am-5pm they have a deal for $9.95 that includes a frozen Margarita, Fideo soup, and your choice of two items from: beef, chicken, or cheese enchilada; chicken, ground or shredded beef taco; chicken or beef flautas; chili relleno. The free chips served as an appetizer were yummy too and included beans, salsa, and guac. Coming back for the daily special in the future!
1	Flavorless, tasteless & overpriced. Service is marginal food even less then marginal. Good if you like things covered in cheese. BTW the charge you if you want more chips.
4	always the first dinner of the Vegas stay while at southpoint! love the free margarita  coupon, and the trio of dips with the chips...ordered the 2 taco meal, but the waiter brought me the 3 taco plate, saying it was the same price..have always known this, but thought it was nice of him to give me the better bargain lol....all Southpoint stays will always include a meal here!
5	While on vacation with family, we decided to try out Baja Miguel's. I have a gluten intolerance (not celiac) so I'm used to limited options while eating out. When I asked the hostess if they had a gluten free menu, the answer was no. I was fully prepared to figure something out on my own but she quickly told me they would accommodate me. When we were seated, I was told I could eat the chips and salsa but not the guacamole or beans because of how they were prepared. I was ecstatic that they were so informed and really seemed to care about my concerns. They even brought me my own bean dip without gluten.When Octavio, our server, came out he again checked with me and even told me the marinade used on the meat has soy sauce in it. Since I couldn't eat that he had the chef prepare an unmarinated meat for me and even included fresh avocado in place of the guacamole I couldn't eat (I had the chicken fajita salad and it was delicious). I was so impressed by his knowledge and the fact that he really cared for my dietary concerns. I will definitely come back again. This was one of the best dining experiences I have had since being diagnosed gluten intolerant.
4	Great lunch special our family of four was easily able to share! Left stuffed and was able to take the kids bowling. Trio of dips is awesome. Service was great (Alejandro) he was attentive and personable. Perfect place when station at the Grandview or Silver Point.
3	Food is decent, but service was poor. Good chips. Waiter served men first and never checked back to see how the food was. Chips not refilled and we ran out of water. Just poor attention to detail.
1	Horrid! Worst Mexican food ever!! Don't order the fish tacos or chicken burritos! Soup was nasty too! Don't waist time here!!
2	This is my third time staying at the South Point, but my first time eating at Baja Miguel's.  I was here with my family (wife and two kids), and the food was decent...except for my daughter's Taco Salad "with Chicken."  It was ice cold and there was no chicken.  It was so bad that I asked for it to be removed from our bill, and said we would order dessert to make up for that.  The waiter never removed it from my bill, said he couldn't do it, and had to ask the manager.The manager was perhaps the WORST manager I've ever dealt with.  She acknowledged the issues with the food but said she would only take half off.  I went back and and forth with her politely, and she only refunded the entire amount after the waiter voluntarily went back to her AGAIN.  I literally saw her walk by our table SHAKING HER HEAD.  I guess "how dare a guest not like the food" was something she never dealt with before.This experience soured me enough to never go back to this restaurant, and I'm not sure I'll stay at the South Point again.If you don't have issues with your food, it's okay.  If you do, don't expect to be treated fairly.
5	LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! We went there for the first time last year and now that we are back in Vegas, I can't wait until Wednesday when it opens so we can go get our food on. Very authentic and the servers are attentive and friendly. You won't be disappointed.
2	Meh...cheap drinks but it's clear why. Mediocre food and atmosphere. I probably won't come back
3	Had dinner here last night. The service was decent, our waiter was very helpful and refilled our drinks as was necessary. They were very accommodating with our children, we needed two high chairs, we were a party of six. Not a problem there.The food is mediocre, nothing spectacular. I had the enchiladas suizas, which were tasty but nothing spectacular. My daughter ordered the beef tamales which were mostly masa and not enough beef. My husband had the carne asada burrito but wasn't excited about it. The one thing I did enjoy was the Taquitos appetizer, the shredded beef was delicious and the taquitos were not overcooked. Crunchy not soft. Another thing I enjoyed was that they give you chips with not only salsa but also beans and guacamole for starters so bam right there you already have nachos!!One disappointment was their drinks selection, we asked if they had any horchata, tamarindo, etc and they don't. Our nice waiter even explained we weren't the first to ask about those drinks, maybe it's something they can look into, I mean come on, even Am Pm offers them. Prices are basic but you do get big servings. If you're craving basic Mexican then this is a good place for you. If you want authentic don't waste your time. Oh and no kids menu :(
3	This place has great food and it isn't too expensive. It is obviously not very kid friendly as they have no kid menu at all, but we went with two young tots and they were accommodating. Great to go with your family or just for a date night.
5	Loved it. Friendly staff and good food. They bent over backwards to address my gluten allergy, and were very knowledgable. I'd definitely return.
2	Mediocre food... salsa tasted too "tomato-y", guacamole was very bland, taquitos were just "ok". Much better food from the small hole-in-the-wall Mexican joints.
4	Let me start by saying my family eats a lot of Mexican food. The atmosphere is very nice and relaxing. Our waiter,Abraham, was a very good waiter and very attentive. They give you chips with 3 dips when you sit down. The chips and the bean dip are excellent the guacamole and salsa are OK. The burritos are really good! Actually all the food we orders was very good. My wife, Bobbi, said the cheese enchiladas were excellent! The steak meals are amazing! Every time we visit Vegas we will be eating here and I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!
2	The only thing I enjoyed was the bean dip!   It was the bomb!   But everything else was like heating up a frozen dinner.  I had the enchilada suiza, my daughter had the flautas and both were not worth eating a quarter of the meal.  Smh
3	The food is ok. I appreciate the chips with sides of bean dip, salsa, and guacamole was placed on the table when we sat down. The staff was friendly. The female 'busser' wore a scented lotion that was very strong and competed with the smell of the food. I mentioned this to her and she made excuses about her hands being dry instead of washing it off. The staff kept talking about how they wanted chocolate that the man from the reservation booth was carrying around in a bag. It is noisy in the restaurant and you can overhear other diner's conversations. They have tables with armless chairs and booths.
5	I've had Mexican food before but nothing like this place. First they bring chips and salsa to your table, but not just salsa, guacamole and refried beans for dipping that is out of this world and it's complimentary !  Since we're staying at the resort we get coupons for a free margaritas. Our entrees of chicken enchiladas were delicious!  Our server Octavio was very pleasant and courteous.
1	Well we are Latin but in the mexicant place we felt discriminate be a Mexican lady Bad bad servicio all around ..
3	Hmmmm......Went for the happy hour special that says 5pm to 7pm on their website (and it's still up as I type). I get there at 6:05 and they said it's 4pm to 6pm now....WTF?Can't order full menu at the bar,only "bar menu"...WTF?Can't order happy hour drinks at the table...WTF?Chips, salsa and guac free at the table, but $4.95 at the bar...WTF?Sat at a table and ordered the chicken fajitas, at $16.95 that's pretty steep for being 5 miles off the main strip...I give them a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10...average but decent portion.Salsa average, decent guac, fresh chipsUnless your staying at this hotel, there are much better options, at better prices with REAL happy hours.
2	I ordered a soft taco with meat and cheese and nothing healthy, and a Cheese Enchilada with nothing healthy, when I got my food they both had lettuce and tomato on them. Did not enjoy them, will not be back.
5	This place is great, from the fresh chips, salsa, bean & guacamole dips the frozen Margarita's as my daughter in law would say "They are the bomb". Service is great our waiter & waitress were very  attentive anyone who had a question they knew the answer, didn't need to check with manager. Differently a must if you want great Mexican food. BTW the refried beans are very, very good.
5	We were looking for a casual meal after seeing a movie at the South Point Hotel. Baja Miguel seem to fit the bill. This was rodeo week in Vegas and the South Point was absolutely jammed at every corner. We went upstairs to see if they would be able to get a party of four in in a reasonable amount of time. The hostess told us it would be about 10 minutes. We decided to wait for the table. About five minutes our beeper was going off and we were seated. Almost immediately, one of our servers brought a basket of chips with three dipping sauces: guacamole, salsa and refried beans. The salsa was very tasty but a little spicier than I cared for. The guacamole and the beans were absolutely delicious. My wife and I decided to share an order of  chicken fajitas. Because we were sharing the server brought us an extra potion of tortillas at no charge. The sizzling platter was filled with chicken, sauteed onions, and sliced peppers. They also had sides of sour cream, guacamole, beans, and rice. The flour tortillas with fresh and incredibly tasty. Overall it made for a absolutely terrific meal. One of the best the fajitas I've had in a long time. And the portion was more than enough to share. The price was ridiculously reasonable. I will be back here again after a movie in the near future.
4	Foodwise, Baja Miguel's is on par with most Mexican restaurants that I've been to. I got a three item combo with a cheese enchilada, a chicken enchilada, and a shredded beef taco. All were really good, and I think they might have thrown in an extra cheese enchilada, but I didn't ask. I really liked that the entire plate was baked with some delicious cheese on top.The service was really good. We had a coupon for a free margarita with purchase of an entree. The margarita was tasty, though small. My husband thought it was light on the alcohol, but I didn't mind since it was free.The big plus here is that unlike every other Mexican restaurant I've been to, they bring out salsa, bean dip, and guacamole with chips for FREE at the beginning of the meal, as in they don't make you pay extra for guacamole! How rare and awesome is that!
1	Terrible food quality and poor service by the server Nadya  to start the New Year 2015.Food-bean dip with the chips was very runny as if it had been watered down. The chicken fajitas-chicken was very small pieces and much of it was not edible as  it hard. The tortillas have changed, now they are smaller, thick and very doughy. Terrible.Took 15 minutes for the margarita to be delivered from the time it was ordered. The Skinny Girl margarita was terrible...found out they use a packet of Slenda, not Agave syrup like all other places use. Is this done to reduce costs. Took Nadya 10 minutes to bring the check to me once I asked for it.This place use to be 5 stars, but no longer.
