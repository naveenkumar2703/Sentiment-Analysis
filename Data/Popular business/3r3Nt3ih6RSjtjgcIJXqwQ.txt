4	I just got back from a 6 month stay over in Chicago.  While I was there, I had a really hard time finding good Asian restaurants.  There were a few good ones, but Vegas wins hands down in my opinion.  The first thing I did when returning was to head to my favorite Japanese restaurant.  On my way home from that I noticed quite a few little restaurants had popped up by my house.I stopped in at Yum Yum and was initially drawn to the overly cute branding.  Apparently one of the brothers in the family that owns this place did all the branding. Now this was one of the major faults of Asian restaurants in Chicago.  Awesome branding, sub par food.  Not the case with Yum Yum. Its a Hawaiian Mom n Pop place and they cook it like they would for their two sons manning the front counter.Get in there and give it a shot.
4	Very friendly owners/servers and decent food.  A mostly Korean menu with some Hawaiian BBQ, burgers, etc. added on.  The food is fresh and hot but not the best in terms of flavor (maybe not enough seasonings?).  (Pass on the fries.  Bibimbap and volcano pork are quite good.)  But as service counts for a lot in this girl's book, I'll stick to my 4 stars.
4	This place has solid food.  The menu covers a wide array of foods, including Korean, Hawaiian, and Japanese.  But for general Asian food that's fast, this is the place to go.I have tried their chicken katsu, bulgogi, volcano pork, and kimchee fried rice.  All of the above are really good, except the chicken katsu...it was a bit dry.  I would definitely go there again to quench my Asian food thirst.
4	I would rather come here 9 times outta 10 and do the AYCE rather then going to a buffet on the strip. The food is excellent, and the service is friendly and prompt. A group of 5 hungry guys went in for lunch, and a group of 5 full and satisfied guys left an hour later. Bulgogi, kabi, chicken katsu, kimchee, mac salad, sushi( which is actually very very good) etc etc. At $12.99 for lunch it is one of the best deals in town.
5	Great selection , good food, and really tasty sushi .the service is excellent .Good value for such great food .a good combo of Hawaii and Korea .They also have an awesome all you can eat deal  .It's definitely worth a try, you wont be disappointed ..
5	mmmm.. good stuff! a mix of korean, japanese, and hawaiian food.  12.99 for all you can eat (specific menu). the menu offers a lot of goods.  bulgogi, chap chae, katsu, short ribs... shrimp tempura roll, dragon roll, garlic shrimp, musubi etc.  everything is good!!!! the owner who seems to be running the show all by himself.. was really friendly and attentive.  it's a cozy place that I definitely appreciate. mmmm..
5	$12.99 (limited time only) FOR DINNER, can you believe it?! I don't think I can even get a mediocre buffet lunch for that price.This place is conveniently close to the hotels which were off the main Vegas strip. And Yelp does wonders because 90% of the patrons who were there were out of towners. The nice thing about this place is that when you walk in, it doesn't reek of kalbi or any other meats It just smelled like... nothing, which is wonderful! The buffet menu came with a disclaimer: "$3 charge for each dish of food you waste. Can only order 2-3 dishes at a time and can't order more till you're done with everything." I suppose that's a semi smart way to ensure large quantities of food don't go to waste. There was a mix of sushi ROLLS (rolls = 6-8 pieces of massive sushi) and your typical Korean stuff like kalbi (should get), bulgogi (can pass), volcano pork (can pass), etc. Our mistake was ordering 3 sushi rolls (didn't know they were rolls at first) during our first round. Oh boy - but luckily we passed it. There's also a mix of Hawaiian in it - garlic shrimp (highly recommend), spam musubi (tastes like any other spam musubi, but seriously... why would you order that when you're having all you can eat?), etc. Overall, this place is great if you're sick of the crab legs, cocktail shrimp and (nasty) prime rib at all the American buffets. The price is great as well!
4	Lets just start off with the fact that im half Korean and cook half of the food they make here at Yum Yum from recipes passed down from my mother (who in all our minds, nobody cooks better than mom). The AYCE was $13.99 which still wasnt bad considering the assortment of items they were offering. -Kalbi -Katsu -Bul Kogi -Chap Chae -Man Du-BBQ chicken -Garlic shrimp (shell on) -Misubi there is quite a bit-about 15-20 different sushi rolls from spicy tuna to tiger rolls and everything in between Surprisingly the Kalbi marinade was on point and very good cuts of meat. Katsu was a bit thin for my liking but not bad just not great. Garlic shrimp was tasty but i hate having to work for my food so peeling the shell just pissed me off. BBQ chicken was grilled and good (not dry) but not sauced up just grilled chicken. Chap Chae was actually not bad considering its pretty easy to mess this dish up, thumbs up. I did have two sushi rolls but honestly it just didnt go with the rest of the meal, so i kept the heaps of meat, noodles, and man du flowing nicely. I will say for the price its hard to beat and coming from a guy who is really picky about his kalbi marinade they actually do quite well with it so dont miss out on that if/when you go. The place is small and in a strip mall sort of situation so dont be overly impressed with the outside appearance even though the logo is actually kinda cute. Its clean and to the point but not romantic or anything to really get dressed up or consider a date kinda spot as you just come here to get your grub on. Check it out!
4	Another gem off the beaten path. It's in the Wal - Mart plaza. The BBQ is actually a fusion of Hawaiian, Korean and Japanese.Everything I tried so far is pretty good and believe me I tried alot last time. Next time I think I'm just gonna go with the AYCE for 13 bucks. This is mom and pop shop, never really seen it busy but thats probably because not many people know about it. The Chicken Katsu was pretty good and the Bul-go-gi kinda tatse like the fake beef from yoshinoya in a GOOD way. You know you love the meat from there even if you are unsure if it's real meat sometimes. Worth checking it out.
4	Great place to get my Korean food fix!The staff are very very nice! Their soondubujigae (tofu soup) is awesome! I asked if it was spicy since it did not have a chili pepper sign next to it and they said they could make it spicy for me. I also really love their kimchee fried rice! Huge portions!Their AYCE is very delicious! I like that they have a mix of korean and even hawaiian style things. Their garlic shrimp is very tasty and addicting! The price is very affordable at $13.99. AYCE is kind of hard when its busy just because it starts to get slow with the food coming out. One time it was busy and the guy just told us we can just order what we wanted (usually a 2 plate max at a time). Thus, we didn't have to wait everytime we were done to order and get our food.They also have shave ice! You can add condensed milk or ice cream to your shave ice! mmm!!
4	I've been here 4 times for lunch, each time doing the ACYE, which is $13.99 all day.The ACYE comes with a little plate of macaroni salad, pickled beets, and sesame marinated bean sprouts.  Sometimes they bring out a bowl of rice and sometimes not.I love the kalbi, man-doo, chap-chae, and the love sushi roll.  The bulgogi, bbq chicken, garlic shrimp and are okay.  While they do have about 16 rolls on the menu, they are all a take on a california roll or a shrimp tempura roll.  Over all, the ACYE is a pretty small menu but worth it if you are in the neighborhood.
5	5 stars because for the AYCE price and quality of food, it cant be beat! service was friendly, not much conversation but i go there for the food. went initially because of the Yelp reviews, and i was SO PLEASED with the food!!! the kalbi was delightful.. definitely my favorite on the menu. man du was not too greasy/oily, i ordered two of that :) i like the fact that they allow only two to three orders per round (per person) (IOW: 2 people can order 6 dishes). the volcano pork was supposed to be spicy.. and it looked really spicy, w the red sauce.. but it was not spicy in the least bit. that's okay, because it was still okay to eat (i'd give the volcano pork a 6 out of 10). garlic shrimp was a pain to deshell, so i just ate it whole (and it was pretty good with the shells!!) chap chae was good too. kalbi and chap chae was my top 2. bulgogi was mediocre.. tasted like pure beef.. not much to it. spicy tuna roll was okay, but the love sushi roll was really good too!! overall, love this place. also you should know a few things before heading over there in terms of pricing: -if one person gets an All You Can Eat, everyone else at the table MUST get AYCE (no exceptions!)-if you get AYCE, and you would to order some items that is not on the AYCE menu (such as bibimbap), it would cost $4 for the other items instead of the regular price. however, you would not be allowed to take those items (that are not AYCE) home if you can't finish it. if you decide to do some takeout along with your dining in, it would be regular price and not $4.00can't wait to come back here when i get back to vegas!!
3	I drove all the way to find this hole in the wall place, and I left disappointed. It's a cozy place fit for parents with small children. They have Korean-Hawaiian-Japanese dishes, The food is mediocre at best. We ordered grilled chicken, fried rice and chap chae (clear noodles),and all I can say is it reminded me of cafeteria food.
5	First time to this restaurant. It was delicious!! The prices were very reasonable!! We will definitely return again.
4	We drove about 15 minutes or so from the strip to get to this place, which isn't too bad.  It's located in a small strip mall type area, so it would be possible to miss it the first time around.  When we entered, it was fairly empty, which I didn't mind at all because that meant we would get our food faster.I was with my friend and our girlfriends, and we all decided to do the buffet.  It was less than $15 each and we soon learned the price was well worth it.  We pretty much tried everything on the menu from the katsu to noodles to the musubis.  Everything was really good, especially the noodles and I believe it was spicy pork?  The only bad thing I had at this place was the sushi roll I ordered.  It had way too much mayo, but it wasn't so bad that it ruined my meal.  Besides, I didn't go there for the sushi anyway.Overall, we were all satisfied with the meal and it is definitely a place I would come back tto.  Affordable, good food, great service.  What more can you ask for at a Vegas buffet?
4	Our family was passing through Vegas and wanted yummy Asian food. Yelped and read many good reviews. We liked this little family owned spot. Though we didn't get to try the bim bam bap the BBQ mix plate was a delicious alternative.
4	Ate here with my boyfriend and the food was pretty decent. Such a small place though. I would say if you're not doing AYCE, that everything else is pretty pricey. But my boyfriend enjoyed it, he ordered the bi bim bap? And it wasn't bad, my first time trying it. I had a sushi roll but didn't finish it. And their macaroni salad was not the business too much mayo and flavor was not to my liking. Overall, we did enjoy  The man gave great service, he was on top of his game. I'd definitely come back.
3	Being from Hawaii, I have a high standard for korean plate lunches.  Normally places on the continental U.S. can't even compare to the local food we have in Hawaii.  It's very weird to have a mix of korean and japanese food in the same restaurant.  No one does that in Hawaii.With all that being said, I was extremely happy with my meal at Yum Yum BBQ.  I had the 2 combination meal with meat jun and bulgogi.   The bulgogi was OK, but the meat jun was delicious.  The meat jun was on the crispy side and didn't ooze any fat.  Some people tend to like the "wet" meat jun style where the meat jun is moist with healthy amounts of oil, fat, and egg, but not me.  Yum Yum's meat jun might be my favorite meat jun, which is a shame because I don't live in Vegas.I also tried 2 sushi rolls, the Yum Yum roll and the shrimp tempura roll. Again it's very weird to have sushi in a korean restaurant, but the sushi was very tasty.  Normally when I go to the mainland to have sushi, I expect bland fish with grainy texture.  I got none of that here.  Both rolls were worthy of being served in Hawaii.I also tried the tofu soup, but that was watery and didn't taste all that great.If I lived in Vegas, I definitely wouldn't complain about the option of eating at Yum Yum BBQ.  They make good food for a good price.  If I'm craving Hawaii local style food I would make my way to Yum Yum BBQ.
5	I first heard about Yum Yum BBQ from a friend. She said it was cheap, and good so i thought , what could go wrong there? The first time I went there I ordered the crispy tempura roll, and the BBQ chicken plate. These dishes were good and made me want to come back for more. The second time I went to Yum Yum in 2009, I finally noticed that they had an "all you can eat" menu. The price for the ability to eat all the sushi rolls, and Hawaiian foods that you wanted was an automatic steal. In 2009 the price for the "all you can eat" menu was a dollar or two cheaper, like it really makes a huge difference. Along with the "all you can eat" there is the "all you can drink" option which allows you to get unlimited sodas or bottled waters from their fridge. One soda or bottle of water usually costs around 1.50-2.00  dollars so you might as well add on the "all you can drink" option for another 2-3 dollars extra.The first time I ordered the "all you can eat" I brought along 5 of my friends to try it with me. They were here visiting from San Francisco, and of course just wanted to eat, eat, and eat. I thought it was a good way to take a break from all the ordinary Las Vegas buffets. We were amazed at all the food options listed on the "all you can eat" menu. There was Hawaiian food such as, chicken katsu, BBQ chicken, spam masubi, etc. There was Japanese food such as the MANY types of sushi rolls they offer (One of my favorite parts about this menu, since regular sushi rolls in other restaurants sell for 8-12 dollars). And there was also delicious Korean BBQ. I definitely suggest the short ribs (kalbi).Every year when my friends come to visit me, Yum Yum BBQ is always on the list of places to eat at here in Las Vegas. I'm sure the waiter who is always there knows us by now. He is really nice, and has lots of patience when serving a group of people who are all hungry for their yummy dishes. Oh and I forgot to add that you can only order 2 dishes at a time, but since it is a small, usually non-busy place, you'll be able to get your order pretty fast.
4	My Kal Bi crush.Heard about this place through Yelp (shocking, eh) and decided to give it a go.  What drew us here was the $14 AYCE.  Seriously, how can you NOT eat $14 worth of Korean food?We tried a bunch of rolls and most of the meats. The stars of the show were the Kal Bi and "Volcano" pork.  I love love love Korean spicy pork and, while this place doesn't have the best, it's pretty darn tasty.  As for the Kal Bi, it was close to being the best I have found in Vegas: tender, savory, slightly charred and still pink in the middle.  My son tore it up.  Between three adults and a one year old, we must have demolished about 6 orders.As good as the Kal Bi was, I have to say that the sushi rolls just weren't very tasty.  I can't even remember which ones we ordered (we had about 4) and none stood out.  Also, the sauce for the meat jun was the same for the man du and shrimp tempura.  Not bad for the most part, but it just did not go with the shrimp.Despite the rolls and sauce, though, the place is totally redeemed by their udon.  It's been a while since we've found tasty udon in Vegas and this place nailed it.  It was so good that, even though it wasn't part of the AYCE, we ordered two bowls.  For the kal bi alone, the AYCE was worth the money.  Add a bowl of udon to that and you've got yourself stuffed.
5	Food was good, friendly service, the meatjun was very tasty, I'd love to go again next time I'm in Vegas.
4	It's all in the name: Yum Yum BBQ is correct.  Kal-bi, meat-jun, and sushi.  The service is very friendly and the fish tastes fresh.  All you can eat for 14$.
5	I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!! I recently moved here to Vegas but since my daughter has lived here for the past few years, we found a place that has great Meat Jun. When I go in, the owner already knows what I'm about to order! Next time, I will surprise him and order the Bi Bim Bap...with a side of meat jun!!!!This little palce is really clean and the food is always cooked to order. These guys make the best meat jun and kal bi and the bulgogi isnt bad either.
4	Cheap and good.  Their sushi is decent but I would stick to the cooked rolls.  I remember we got 6 rolls for take out and bill came out to $21 including tax.  The California roll was like $2.95.  You can't even get supermarket sushi for that cheap.But their BBQ is by far the best.  So far I've had the chicken.  It's inexpensive and so flavorful.  I love the male server with the flower apron.  He seems to let the dirty dishes pile up at the tables, even when you push them to the edge.  He also can't grasp the concept of carrying more than two plates at a time.  He'll make a million trips just to deliver a few dishes.  But he cracks me up every time.  His floral apron makes me smile.
3	BBQ mix was pretty good.
5	Awesome kalbi!!!!! Very tasty and meaty!!!! Sushi is good too!!!! Service is great! AYCE and AYCD soda too!!!!
3	Stopped in for some quick sushi & hawaiian short ribs before leaving town to go back home.  The food was tasty, and the portions were generous. It was a good value.My only complaint is that only some of the rolls featured whole pieces of tuna.  I ordered two rolls where the spicy tuna was ground up. A lot of sushi places do this now, and I don't really understand it.Otherwise, service was friendly & quick, and we enjoyed our meal.
4	While the sushi is not spectacular, it is still pretty darn good for the price. The kalbi, however, makes this place a steal at $14 for the ayce option. My favorite thing about this place has to be the threatening remarks on the menu that state that Yum Yum will charge you for unfinished food. Apparently Yum Yum doesn't want you to waste food, or they want to pretend to be your mom and tell you to clear your plate. Either way, this shouldn't be a problem if you choose the right items (kalbi, meat jun, tempura). Pick wisely and you will crave Yum Yum all the time. One final note would be to stay away from the eel because it's a little funky here (other funky items include chap chae and masubis).
4	I like the quality and selection of food. the nice environment.Also for about 5 bucks extra you can make a regular meal into all you can eat. I dislike that there is no difference in prices for lunch and dinner, pretty pricey, kinda slow service during when there was anyone except another customer. I would come back and try the all you can eat but afraid of how slow service would be.
4	**Summary**       - Flavor - Aside from the garlic shrimp, nothing stood out too much for flavor. Most things were decent to good.       - Variety - This is the only place I've seen serving Hawaiian, Korean, and Japanese in a buffet.       - Value - They have the same price all day and since they raised their price to $15.99, it isn't as great a deal, but it definitely beats out most places for value at dinner time.       - Rules - Though it says order 2 or 3 items per round and finish your plate before the next, they didn't enforce it as much with us. I'm assuming the rule is there for those who abuse the system.       - I'd definitely recommend ordering the Hawaiian Garlic Shrimp, Kalbi, and Bulgogi.       - If you like spicy, I'd say go for the Volcano Pork.       - For all those sushi connoisseur (those who'd never order a California roll), I'd stay away from the sushi.**Price**       - $15.99 AYCE**Ordered**       - Hawaiian Garlic Shrimp - After peeling through two shrimp shells, I just started eating them whole. The shell is crispy enough to do so. This dish is very good and very buttery. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=TFhT4KvNPC_gsV2YchDiMA)       - Bulgogi - A little dry compared to the grill your own Korean BBQ, but tasty. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=h9OXc15_aY8oCmYaEWFuxg)       - Kalbi - Not as flavorful as L&L, but it's a buffet, so it wasn't bad. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=h9OXc15_aY8oCmYaEWFuxg)       - Volcano Pork - This was a little too spicy for me. I guess they really meant volcano. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=uMofJGiHNph0pn2coNGEqA)       - Chap-Chae - Clear noodles. Pretty good compared to other chap chae, but I don't really like chap chae. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=h9OXc15_aY8oCmYaEWFuxg)       - Tempura Shrimp - A little too much breading on the shrimp tempura for my taste.       - Spam Musubi - They use less teriyaki sauce than most places. I felt it a little bland.       - Meat Jun - Thin slices of beef dipped in egg batter and fried. Wasn't my cup of tea.       - Sexy Girl Roll - The spicy tuna was not very spicy at all. The rice-sushi ratio was a slightly high. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=KVndGIPsZ6wXYCwNM52g2w)       - Alaskan Roll - A hefty portion of imitation crab in the middle. The salmon was not the freshest, but decent. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=vTJVUzj5mNzAkwvmT8zh2Q)**Recommendations**       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a decent dinner buffet. The variety somewhat makes up for a slight lacking in quality.
4	The benefits for coming to this place: Cheap prices and the perk of having the same price all you can eat for lunch and dinner! It is fairly cheap as well, definitely a plus! Our server was really nice but he was trying to make us order hot food instead of the expensive sushi stuff. He didn't stop us from ordering it but the way he insinuated it bothered me. Oh well, he was a small part of my meal, i enjoyed the food which was the most important thing. It only takes a few plates of food to eat your money's worth and i may have even made them lose money which means you really did eat a lot! Highly recommended!
5	I came here on a whim and I'm so glad I did. This place is off the chain (not a dog eating joke). It's about $20/person when you do the "all you can eat" option. I have never been to a place that served food in this manner, but wowsers... I like! The waiter comes and you order about 2-3 selections per person, you finish that, the waiter comes back, and you order again. This process is repeated until you are stuffed silly.Can you imagine ordering all the chicken katsu, spam musubi, and kalbi you want? CAN YOU?! Plus, all the food is made to order (I think), so it's steaming hot when it gets to your table.I didn't try too many of their sushi options, but the cream cheese roll tasted flavorful and fresh. Unlimited drinks are an additional fee and they have a fridge in the lobby where you can get up & grab as many drinks as you want, changing it up each time you go.To top it all off, customer service was awesome. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. It was seriously so yum yum!
2	I decided to come here after reading all the Yelp reviews, but I was somewhat disappointed.Volcano Pork - good spice, good flavor, but VERY greasyBBQ Beef - VERY dryMeat Jun - This was very delicious, but it did get a little greasy after a while. It's a thin slice of beef that's dipped in egg and fried.Hawaiian Garlic Shrimp - Great flavor! This was my favorite dish.Vegetable Egg Roll - basic, nothing special.The sushi wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst I've ever had. The plus side is the rolls are huge, but it also keeps you from trying more rolls because you get so full. Spicy Tuna Roll - OKDragon Roll - Good.Sexy Girl Roll - Good.I'll probably give it another chance at some point, but I don't think I"ll ever come back for the AYCE. The grease just consumed me.
5	This is my favorite place for Korean considering the value and quality of the food. I usually get the buffet (not a real buffet as in the food stations). This buffet is better because it is made to order. You pick a few items off the menu and it is made fresh and then order some more items off the menu. All for $15.99! I do hate it when others, who don't know Korean, food rate these types of places. I am a S. Korean and I know my food. Is it the best Korean ever? No..BUT it is pretty dang good for the value that you are getting. I liked everything on the menu and it tastes how it suppose to taste. Most of the food is basic Korean food done well. If you go a regular Korean al-a-carte restaurant, you will pay more. It is a good expierence for those who aren't sure what to order in a Korean restaurant.
1	We rolled up on Tuesday before 8 pm and it was closed!  WTH!  I was starving and now I can't try you BBQ!
4	I love kalbi, chop-che, bulkogi and tofu soup.(I don't know exact name)I wish this place open late!
4	Great service; good food. Take extra time to drive here if you are on your way to SURA BBQ. This is a family business so they care how what the customers think of their service and food. Get the kalbi and the rolls.
5	I just love this place!
5	I'm an AYCE nut, and have tried most buffets, all you can eat joints, and salad bars in town.What makes Yum Yum special is that each dish is cooked to order. Yes, you can only order 3 at a time. Big deal. Eat here more than once and you'll pick up the rhythm right away. Service is excellent, as the restaurant is small and the one fella who handles the front of the restaurant stays on the move while the cooking goes on in the back. Sushi is included with AYCE, including my favorite, the Philly Roll. It's not $30 AYCE sushi quality, but it's way way better than buffet level and a great deal at half the price.A number of other items are available, including Volcano Pork, Teriyaki Chicken, Garlic Shrimp, Spam Musubi, and more, but if you don't order Kalbi, and lots of it, you're missing out. I've eaten Kalbi all over town and NEVER found it this tender, juicy, and delicious!While you're at it, spring a little extra for the flavored tea. I go with Passion Fruit, but they're all fantastic.
4	The guy that answers the phone recognizes my voice......so I guess you can say I'm a fan since I order to go every Monday night before I head off to help out with my church youth group.I honestly don't usually order rolls if I have a choice of sashimi/sushi....but I must say the dragon and tiger rolls are quite tasty here and extremely cheap at $6.99/roll.  Some places, the rolls have a not so fresh/fishy quality to them....but not here...the eel always tastes fresh, as well as the tuna.   The rolls are also ginormous in size....with that being said...I can still finish two rolls on my own easily =).  This is really a Hawaiian restaurant, I believe the owners mentioned they hail from Maui.... The Hawaiian selections that stand out are the meat jun (thinly sliced beef wrapped in fried egg) and bbq chicken.   I've tried the pork and beef options...but they seemed a little on the dry side for my liking.I haven't had the opportunity to do the all you can eat option here...but for ~$15/person....I'm determined to do it at some point.  The AYCE menu consists of all their sushi roll options, the typical Hawaiian plate lunch options (kalbi, bbq beef, bbq chicken, volcano pork, katsu, garlic shrimp etc), tempura, spam musubi, and the list goes on. This is a pretty small establishment in a strip mall with a goofy monkey logo, but don't let that fool you...this place is definitely a hidden gem.
4	Good food, huge portions good price. Minus 1 star cause they close so early. Only open until 9pm.
3	Just moved to Las Vegas and still getting used to the wide selection of Hawaiian BBQ joints.  We read good reviews here so we went.  Selection seems pretty standard but I like the variety of a Bento Box so I ordered one with Volcano Chicken.  The chicken was probably the best part of both of our meals.  It was spicy (could have been more so for me :) charred, well seasoned and it was thigh meat so it wasn't dried out.  Everything else in the box was just standard.  My companion ordered a two meat plate with the Volcano Pork and beef that was breaded with egg batter and fried.  They were both mediocre and the pork was a bit gristly and not as charred as the chicken.  All in all it was ok, if you do go, the Volcano Chicken is probably the best bet.
2	For a few dollars more I will go to Sushi Mon next time I want AYCE Sushi or any Sushi for that matter.  Sushi Mon is that place I compare all other suhsi places unless I find a better one.  Sushi Mon is just down the street in same neighborhood.  Yum Yum BBQ only offers VERY LARGE sushi rolls.  1/2 orders are not allowed so 2 rolls and couple sides and it's about all the variety 2 people can consume on AYCE menu.  No Nagiri Sushi on menu, small selection of fish.  The place is clean and quiet, not very busy when I was there.
3	Not a fan of this place, it's alright but def. doesn't compare to L&L even though they are pretty much copying everything. The macaroni salad tastes terrible! Meat is really overcooked and doesn't have good flavor. Would recommend going somewhere else.
5	AMAZING!!!!!! I'm from Hawaii and they have the best kalbi here!!! Even the meatjun is great!!! I've been  coming here for years and have not been disappointed once.
4	Found a flyer on my door for this place that had a "Pre-Opening" today.  Sushi rolls for $5, today only.  Why not?  I love sushi and this is a great chance to check them out.First off, this is more of a deli than sushi bar.  You go to the counter to place your order.  Then sit down in one of the 6 tables and wait for them to bring it to you, or you can just get it "to go".At $5 (normally $6-9) the portions are real good.  I ordered one each of the Dragon Roll and Alaskan Roll.  Both came with crab meat, just a bit more mayo than I prefer, BTW I'm not a big fan of mayo, so take that for what it is.  Each plate had wasabi and ginger, enough for me and a friend if we had 2 rolls each.  That is just way to much wasabi and ginger.  They are condiments, not garnishes.  Beyond that, presentation was excellent, the rolls looked fresh and appetizing. Now for the really bad.  Location, you hear this all the time, location, location, location.  And they picked a bad spot.  If you are familiar with this area, it's where the Jersey Mike's Subs used to be.  In a small strip mall away from the street.  With the Jiffy Lube and Sonic Drive-Thru surrounding it, you'll easily drive right past it.  Even looking for it, you can easily miss it.With 808 and Sumo just a block away, this place will not be my go-to sushi spot for dinner.  Lunch, on the other hand.  With the speed the rolls came out, I can see me coming here for a quick roll on the run.
5	Wow, i found them. Yum yum bbq opened at a new location. It's at 7225 south durango cross street warm spring - next to sonic. Did the AYCE for 19.99 and drinks were included - Awesome!!! As for the food, it's always top notch when you do a cost comparison and compare it to the portion and taste of the food.  Enjoy all!!!
4	Definitely a local's place.  I had the Gal Bi which was pretty darn good.  Loved the greasiness of it.  Just the right amount of flavorings too.  The service was very fast and efficient.  Great place if you're in a hurry.
1	This place is closed
4	Great food. Asian style with fusion of Korean, Japanese and Hawaiian (spam musubi).  Dinner time was packed but the wait was not long.  Service was good.
1	It's cheap and you get what you pay for. My iron stomach is a total mess... Never felt this bad after sushi in my life.
