3	I was all set to write a review of this Friday afternoon and give it two stars, but Friday night, after the ball game, we headed up there.  Somewhere in between the good conversation, loud-but-not-too-loud bar noise and more than a few drinks I had a great time.  The trappings (flags, showy beer taps, etc) ring a bit false to me, but I am, after all, an Irishman treading in dangerous territory.  Drinks are stiff and relatively cheap.  There's usually always a free table to sit at and the clientele is varied and friendly.  Not the best of CenPho but not the worst, either.
4	Yes, it's true.  You will hear British accents here. One of the better neighborhood bars in central Phoenix, George & Dragon is also one of the best British pubs in Arizona.  A very friendly and diverse crowd - I made some of my first friends here in AZ at George & Dragon.  Not exactly like a typical British/Irish pub crowd - as this place is frequented by a more punk-rock, rag-tag, counter-culture bohemian crowd.  Whatevs.  It keeps things interesting.  People playing darts or pool are always up for talking and invite you to join in.  The bartenderesses here are always very nice and well endowed at the same time.Beer selection is among the best in Central Phoenix it would make any discerning Brooklyn hipster drool with delight. Chimay, Tetley's, Stella Artois, Kronenburg, Boddington and Anchor Steam are among the brews available. The jukebox is a gem - everything from The Kinks to the Police, David Bowie and Tom Jones.  No Country Karaoke on Mondays is a riot, and has one of the hugest song lists in town from which to choose.  They have also recently added a 1960s British mod dance night on Wednesdays.
2	My first and only experience (to date) with George and Dragon was not very pleasant. When you walk in you are magically whisked away to an all-too-authentic British pub. That's great if what you are after is smelling like an ashtray after a meal of Shepherd's Pie. The waitress that served me seemed a little brusque. Maybe that's part of the restaurant's "charm"?  The bathroom was in a transitory state of disrepair... or at least I hope it was transitory. I wasn't even sure if I was supposed to be in there.Televisions are available for watching the soccer match and they have many types of beer on tap. I noticed a jukebox but didn't turn it on for fear of being pummeled severely by the other gruff-looking patrons while the soccer match was on.This place has a little bit of an edge to it. If that's what you're into and you're just looking for a spot to grab a beer with a buddy, then check it out for sure. I'm not sure when or if I'll be back again, personally.
4	I have to be honest, I've not tasted the food at George & Dragon.  This is based solely on the libations.I have been there a few times for some beer and chit-chat, and my favorite thing about this place is the energy that lights the place up.  It just has a "fun place" feel to it, and that opinion was shared by a couple of people I had met there now and then for some pints.If a loud pub is not your style, this won't be either, but otherwise it's definitely worth a try.
3	Three and a half stars. I feel for this place as the light rail construction has made it damn near impossible to even try to drop in here. In the days before the light rail destroyed Central Avenue I would come here from time to time, and it was always ok. Not especially good or bad, just ok.Beers are expensive but they have a good selection of foreigns to test out. What is mildly discouraging is that even the domestics are overpriced.They occassionally host cool events or concerts here and I highly recommend dropping in on days like those, but aside from that, whatever.
3	minus a star for not having an EPL ticket to show all the games. for F###'s sake you are THE english bar in phoenix and I can't watch my beloved gunners unless they are on ch 167?? come on.  If you are going to hang the flags and scarfs at least have the game, when its 7am and i want to get pissed watching arsenal-chelsea in the '5th' biggest city in the US and I cant, well, it doesn't make daddy happy. hahaall in all not a bad placegreat beer selectionnice decor, simply put, its one of those places where you get some drinks in for 2-3 hours, walk out and say "holy sh!t, the sun is still out????"
4	a great laid back bar with tons of comfy booths, carlsberg on tap,  plenty of english football and memrobilia, and a lot of good people. as others have said, the place has an edge to it pretty much just because of its location in the art district. its one of the great laidback bars for the hipster/punk crowd next to shady's and the paper heart. its a great place to go before/after first friday or roller derby. and just a great place to hang out or warm up before going elsewhere.the one star off is for the food there which is pretty lackluster. its a little on the expensive side and comes in small portions and pretty mediocre quality. definitely not the best fish and chips you will ever have. i would stick to the great beer selection which yes, includes carlsberg on draft. i haven't found another place in arizona which even sells carlsberg in bottles, but then there aren't many english pubs in arizona.the no EPL ticket is pretty lame though, they really need to shell out the dough for that.
5	The fish and chips is where it's at. The coleslaw is pretty much the best i have ever had. The shepherds pie is excellent as well. The best pub food in Phoenix by far.
5	A fun, laid-back bar where everything is worn, well loved, and comfortable.  The food is delicious and reasonably priced.  Went for lunch today.  Navigating the construction traffic was difficult, but worth it.  I ordered the Shepherds Pie (delicious comfort food!) and my friend ordered the fish and chips (likewise tasty!).  Massive beer selection, friendly waitresses, great atmosphere - definitely worth a try and I hope to get back again soon.
4	This bar is not for everyone, and its location leaves much to be desired... however, I can't help but love this place. It's a little bit of a trek for me, so I don't go very often - however, I do try to go as much as I can. When smoking was allowed, this place was difficult to breathe in. Now it's much nicer. The food is delicious I think, but I've had friends tell me they weren't so pleased... most people I talk to though seem to like it. There are booths that seat about 5 people. The seats are high and make it somewhat private. The bar is huge and they have waitstaff, so it's fairly easy to get a drink usually. It's also seldom crowded which is nice. They host their own free poker nights with prizes... there's also pool, darts, and plenty of televisions to watch soccer on. G&D could use a bit of a facelift, but it's holding up well. The waitresses and bartenders are pretty hot and look like they could be suicide girls. There's usually someone good looking in there - but no pressure to be good looking or dressed up yourself. It's very casual. The place has a bit of a punky edge to it - most of the regulars seem to be into that. If that's "your people" then you should go check it out. If these aren't your people and you want to check it out - don't feel intimidated... everyone there is pretty nice. I should also mention that there's lots of beer on tap and the mixed drinks are usually really strong.I'm realizing now that I need to come up with a formula for my reviews so they are more uniform and aren't so chaotic. Basically, G&D is a good place to go for a British Pub experience in the valley, but it's really more of a neighborhood bar full of regulars than a hot spot. Totally worth checking out though.
4	I mostly come here on Thursday nights for trivia night - and I always have a great time. The happy hour is decent and I like to take advantage of the $1 off any beer. They have a great beer selection on both draft and by the bottle. As an added bonus, you can add a $1 shooter to your draft at any time. Food-wise, the Shepard's Pie is large and delicious - the perfect comfort food to accompany that pint. The fish and chips is another favorite of mine - the generous fillet is cooked just to the right crispiness. The atmosphere is the real fun though, if you're into the whole English pub vibe. The place oozes Britain - from the flag painted on the bathroom ceiling to the tube sign tables. Plus the owner, David, is actually from Britain and mingles with the customers as if he was welcoming him into his own home. Be sure to check out the jukebox - it's one of the best I've seen!
4	4240. Easy address to find. Plenty of parking in the rear. Street-facing patio for those who want to poke their heads outside, or for those who need their nic fix. No noticeable "Entrance," though the "Exit" Is marked (I guess that's the more important sign to have up, anyway, in case the party inside gets too fun.)  (NOTE: "Main Entrance" is on the south side of the building. Once you walk in, the bathrooms are on your left - pool tables on your right. So much safer than walking into a game of darts!)We walked in through the Exit... and just about took a dart to the temple. Quick, duck! There were patrons playing darts, chattin' at tables, standing at the bar... It was filled without being packed. Open seats at the bar beckoned to us, so who were we to ignore the call? I took my seat and ordered a Guinness. Service was fast and attentive. My 2nd round came right as I finished my first. This place is cool, although on the night I went (my first night, for the record) I noticed there was plenty of men, but only a few females. This bodes well if you're looking to get hit on, I thought... Of course, what happens when I just want to chill out with a drink? Guess we'll see next time. In any case, with my friend in tow and conversation free flowing, I had a great time. Bonus - this place is within stumbling distance from my new abode. Nice! So, naturally, the night I'm saddled up to the bar and enjoying my Irish beer and the happy buzz that it gives me, I notice something peculiar. Never mind the mix of people -- from artistic smarts to tat canvases to baseball fans. Instead, I noticed the female bartenders cleaning up the bar with aggressive impatience... almost like slapping their rags on the bar top was the clear call to clear out. What time was it? I checked my phone. 12:18, precisely. Even bars in Oklahoma stay open later than that. I looked at my comrade in puzzlement. What gives? I guess we were being told that closing was coming soon, and our patronage with on a deadline. Well then. I savored the last gulps of my Guinness and we left... long before last call, I'm certain of it. But I didn't want to stick around to find out. 4 stars - based on a first experience. I say that's pretty damn good. I'll definitely be back. (NOTE: I went back...the next night! And I had just as great - if not a better - time at G&D. Bonus! I heard real British accents!)
5	"Fancy a shoe shine Governaaa?"  (Governor for you non-British)Authentic British style Pub...enough said. George & Dragon is fabulous! On the outside it looks mediocre at best, though the British feel is felt as soon as you walk in and see all the different Football Club Flags, Football Jerseys, (Soccer for you non-British) and UK country flags, and other miscellaneous pub paraphernalia. Inside, the place is warm and inviting, the tables have the Union Jack, English Cross, and London Underground Logos on them. The crescent shape booths are comfortable, and the bar has ample seating. This is place you go to with friends, or a date, and just spend hours talking over some pints.  The music is chosen by the patrons via a "secret" jukebox, so it can vary from Van Morrison, to Curtis Mayfield, to Outkast.  I went with my favorite pub "friend', one that we can just talk for several hours and not really notice the time, so it made the experience that much more enjoyable. This is really a place you can just loose track of time and amount of pints consumed, as you expect to walk outside and hop on some form of public transportation and make your way back to your flat (apartment for you non-British). I guess the war zone that is Central Ave, will bring us a form of transportation in this area, but judging by the condition of this road, we have a bit of time to wait.  As I was waiting for my friend I chatted up a guy sitting outside about how I drove from The Roosevelt to G&D on Central Ave. He asked me "what do you have a 4x4?" and was serious. I said "No I have a Golf, but it's German."  Moral of this story, avoid Central Ave. at all costs.  The one small downside, (bathroom issue) is the size of the bathrooms, they have just one toilet,  for men and one for women, which really is meant  for just one person at a time. In traditional European fashion,  I was "doubled up on".  As I went in to relieve myself, a dude just followed me in and was planning on using the above mentioned toilet, as I took the urinal.  I said "Hey, you doubling up in here?" He proceeded to respond "Hey we are guys, it's cool" This is the type of place that doubling up in the men's bathroom is OK, it just adds to th charm, hey you could triple up here, as they do have a sink as well. ;)
4	Back before the statewide smoking ban, George & Dragon used to really get me goolies in a twist. I mean, here's a place where I can watch soccer, get a good plate of fish & chips and choose from many good brews. But I could't go there because I'm a normal air-breathing human. But now, it's 2007 and the smokers have been banished to the outdoors. Gooooooaaaaaaaaallllll! That means I can hang out at the George and watch quality soccer since I'm too cheap to spring for Gol TV at home. Plus I don't have a bartender firing off hysterical commentary at home. The shepherd's pie isn't bad, either. But if you're in the mood for a Cornish pasty, go to The Cornish Pasty Company in Tempe. They don't play the soccer games, but you stand a good chance of hearing some Iron Maiden blaring over the speakers!Back to the George, I think we've covered it all. Now just wait 'til that blasted construction is finished...
4	Veggie pasty. Old Peculiar. HP Sauce. A side of darts. Try and get those things together anywhere else in Phoenix. I dare you. 'Nuff said.
4	The biggest challenge here is getting your hands on a drink menu. IF, and I mean IF, you are able to obtain one of the elusive drink menus you are in for a treat.George and Dragon is really different than other local bars and pubs. It's owned by a true Brit with a real cockney accent and run by a bunch of tatted up punk rock looking girls. The contrast of the football flags and the Camden town style of the wait staff makes the atmosphere interesting. There is a good crowd at the bar. Except for the usual few a-holes you find in every bar, The G & D is patronized by hipsters and business men alike. Families eating bangers and mash sit seats away from rowdy college kids. Stock brokers drink ale next to drunkards slamming whiskey and stylish career gals drinking cosmos. It's a unique mix rarely found in Arizona.The food is pretty good too. English food is by definition terrible. I lived in Cambridge for a few months and found it hard to digest most traditional English fare, but G & D does a good mix of American classics and British favorites. Even the cold egg thing that my boyfriend loves (and I hate) seems to be a hit with most patrons.George and Dragon is a great place to meet with friends, have happy hour with co-workers or sit alone and stew. Either way you should have a good time in this gem of a pub. Don't forget to try the fried pickles!
4	This is a pub.  Pool, darts and good beer.  The food is typical bar food with an English flavor to it.  The crowd is always a mix, and a pleasant one at that.  It's central location makes it easy for the after work crowd, which is when I went.  Haven't been there in the evening.  Plenty of parking, which is a plus in this area.
4	I first fell in love with George & Dragon during World Cup 2002. On the night Brazil defeated England, the patrons actually lifted the one man with a Brazil jersey into the air and carried him to the back door.People often think G&D has overpriced drinks. It really doesn't. Last night, I bought $8 rounds of vodka tonic and Smithwick's pints. I don't know how the price was split, exactly, but $4 for either drink is decent.Monday's No Country Karaoke isn't much different from your average karaoke night, but a few genuinely talented crooners do show up, and the wireless mike makes the whole pub a stage.G&D's business has slowed because of light-rail construction on Central, but the fun factor still is there. I've never had a bad time. If singing and drinking isn't your thing, pool tables line one side of the pub. Also, a fenced outdoor patio allows smokers to have a puff while keeping their drinks in hand. Bravo.
4	Great English pub with great food, beer and atmosphere. We have spent many a night here, even a few New Years Eves, which was a lot of fun.They have a great beer selection, their food, mostly traditional English fair is really good, some of the best fish and chips in town.The staff is courteous and friendly, as are the patrons.The place is decorated with a lot of wood, English football banners and scarves, TVs with football (soccer) playing and both tables and booths, other than the bar.There is a dining hall next to the main room, a few pool tables and jukebox and nightly events. G&D is always a great time, one of the best places to meet up with friends for dinner and drinks.
4	I love the "no apologies" approach of George and Dragon.  I've been going to this bar for almost 8 years (which is a lifetime in PHX), and not even the scent has changed (despite being smoke-free, for what, like 2 years)Its like the Binion's Horseshoe of Phoenix pubs.  Classic.  Comfortable. Cocksure. Vile.  Smarmy.  Ruddy.Everything a British Pub should be -- complete with Smithwick's and Fish/Chips.Their music is tip-top, and though it doesn't exist anymore, I was highly, HIGHLY impressed by their Northern Soul night on Wednesdays.  I mean, holy smokes, what a freaking stunt!  Too bad it couldn't maintain.Either way, you've got the EPL on Saturdays and Sundays, so this appeases the loss of midweek, underground Motown.And as an aside, this place is mos def in my Top 5 of places that need to have the smoking ban recanted.  Yes, i have a list.
4	English Pub theme aside, this is one great all-around bar / restaurant.  After 6 or 7 visits, no element of this place has disappointed me.  George and Dragon "feels" like it could've been one of the first pubs in Phoenix, yet I don't know how long its been around... my point is it feels great.The service is always friendly and prompt, the crowd is always diverse, and the frequent weekend live music is a big plus.  I've felt sort of a rockabilly theme more often than not, but I have yet to make it there on a Wednesday, so I can't speak to anything but the weekend crowd.I also heard its a good place to get some work done in the afternoon, as they offer wi-fi, too!  Cool, eh?Pool and darts live here, too, as noted in previous reviews.Want a great place to catch up with some out-of-town friends without being annoyed?  Go to George & Dragon!  Great vibe, great bar.
1	I'm being generous - they don't deserve the star.Because several friends recommended the G&D, I went in there once.The place was NOT busy.  I sat down at a table.  While waiting for service, I pulled out my PDA and read the news off the net.  When I looked at my watch, and saw that half-an-hour had gone by without anyone EVER coming within 6ft. of my table -- much less asking if I wanted to order anything -- food or booze or coffee or a glass of water -- nobody.  Nothing.  I simply got up and walked out.When I go to a restaurant, I do NOT beg for service.  I expect someone to come to my table and ask me if I want something.  They didn't do that.Fortunately for me, there is, at least, another restaurant (there may even be two or three) in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area, so I won't starve.  Altho, with that level of non-service, the G&D might.
4	When in Central Phoenix, this is always one of my favorite places to go.  It's quite the funky English Pub, and a great place to watch European soccer matches.  They have a HUGE selection of beers from all over the world, and pretty decent food (not great, not horrible, just decent) on the menu.I like this place because the people who come here have this "I am who I am and this is how I'm going to be" attitude.  There is not one "type" of person that comes here, which makes it great in my mind.  They have pool tables, darts, and a good juke box too.  I cannot remember at time where I have had bad service here too, and the staff is totally funky and fits the vibe of the place.One should not expect the world if they come here, but for just an all around good time, the G&D is for you.  The best English Pub in the valley in my mind.
5	Being English, I love this restaurant. Great fish and chips, bangers and mash, shepherd's pie and of course sherry trifle dessert. Cool place to play darts and socialize and mingle. The staff is friendly and atmosphere great. Love their beer selection, I drink Newcastle the most.
4	I've been feeling kind of homesick (for Chicago [i got over it])) lately. Went to this bar/restaurant a few weeks ago and it felt like home. When I first stepped in there was that old nasty smoke smell. The Clash was playing on the jukebox. I'm not a smoker and I usually don't like that smell, but I instantly felt a sense of happiness. I know! Pretty wackadoo. But right away it felt like it had some history to it. Love the big booths andthe service was great. The waitress was so friendly, but not in a so bubbly I'm going to vomit kind of way. The fried zucchini and sausage rolls were yummolicious. Cornish pasty was good. Yorkshire pudding. Not so good. It was almost solid. Yorkshire pudding is suppose to be puffed up and hollow. And it was in this yucky gravy. But I forgive them. You can't be too picky about English cuisine. But I will definitely come back to try the fish and chips.
5	Despite the Union Jacks and other signage of British Origin, you will never lose yourself and think you're in a London pub. However, this is a fun lively place with an orgasmic selection of beers and a wonderful atmosphere. It will NEVER be London, but it's about as close as you'll get in The valley. HIGHLY recommend it!
4	I don't know what it is about this place. It smells like my Grandma's closet, the clientele are questionable and none of it makes a bit of damned sense why I keep returning. Besides their beer selection putting a twinkle in my eye and the menu making my heart stop. I find it endearing to post up and get crunk on the patio overlooking Central Ave.I took a first date here, she enjoyed herself and I got a goodnight kiss that night. He shoots, he scores! Maybe it was just the booze talking.Nevertheless, it's definitely my default. Since its within walking distance, "G&D" is sent in a mass text message on any of the 6 nights I drink.
4	Loves it!Nothing like the eery feeling that you might get raped in the parking lot to make a girl come back for more..... and that is precisely what I do. Its super close to home for one thing...walkable.  The food is actually pretty phenom. for "bar food" . Oddly they serve a chicken satay in some sort of peanut saucy fabulousness that is pretty damn amazing. The pool tables suck, but hey, I suck at pool, we're even. Where else can you get hammered for 20.00 while wearing pajama bottoms and not feel the least bit out of place.If you can get past the creepers that haven't been laid in centuries and the distinct feeling that one or more of the waitstaff has probably been smoking meth all day I suggest you check it out. Just make sure you bring an escort ladies.
4	We ended up there on Saturday night after a fabulous dinner and some pre drinking. We were met with friendly faces and an awesome waitress. She was the type of waitress that could anticipate what you would want to drink and never kept us waiting. It is a very chill, laid back environment, great for drinking the night away. the service was so impressive we never made it to the list of other places we wanted to try that night.
3	Three stars might not seem like a rave review, but since I'm not a huge beer drinker, don't go to bars to watch sports, and prefer ethnic food over food from the Mother Land, three stars from me means that G&D is doing something right. My husband and I met my uncle and aunt for dinner here on Labor Day. I was surprised that they were even open, and it was definitely slow because pretty much every server was standing outside smoking when we arrived. Not that I'm judging because as a former server, I can tell you that there's nothing worse than working a shift on a holiday, especially when it's more of a grilling-and-having-people-over type of holiday. Anyway, we sat in the bar area in one of the extraordinarily comfortable booths. The booth directly faced the bar and was much more inviting than the somewhat closed-off dining area on the right. To drink, I had a Bloody Mary. I was pleased that our server asked how spicy I wanted it (since that meant it would be made from scratch) and even more pleased when I tasted it and found it to be delicious. You could really taste all the individual ingredients, including the oft-neglected horseradish, and it really hit the spot after a long weekend of drinking. I also tried my aunt's Long Island, and it was really good and not too sweet. My husband and I split the "English Dip" and the Philly cheese steak. Neither was particularly good. I think we both erred in not ordering British classics because my uncle's Shepherd Pie was at least hearty and sort of the quintessential comfort food. My aunt's fish and chips was also decent, although she said it wasn't nearly as good as Rosie McCaffey's. I am definitely not opposed to coming back here, especially for No Country Karaoke on Monday nights (does that mean I can't sing Martina McBride?). However, when I do return, I'm going to stick to drinking (I'll gladly have another of those Bloody Marys) and then after a few drinks, try one of the British pub dishes. After all, it's after a few drinks that carb-heavy and filling pub food really serves its true purpose.
3	Took Mom here since I'd read great reviews on the fish and chips.  As soon as we walked into the venue, I detected terrible body odor.  While the vibe was young and friendly, we didn't feel comfortable at all.  Then again, I never hung out in bars when I was younger, and neither did my Mom.  After trying out a couple restaurants' fish and chips, she definitely favors George & Dragon's (everything from the perfectly light, yet tasty batter, the best hand-cut steak fries, and tartar sauce she couldn't get enough of... don't forget the malt vinegar!), but laments on not being able to go back...and thus continues our quest for a great fish and chips meal served in a great setting.  Any reco's?  We've been to McCormick and Schmick's and Rula Bula; both weren't good enough for her.  Please, no fast food chains like Long John Silver's, Pete's Fish and Chips, and similar spots (my terms, not hers as she LOVES LJS).
3	This place is solid. Good beer, good pub food, and they price everything decently. For every other new English/Irish pub that pops up, does a good few months, and goes out of business, this place is still here. Don't expect haute-culture and fine dining, just pub grub and beers. Not great, not horrible, but it's what it is.The market is there, I just don't know why other places seem to have such a hard time filling the demand.
4	I have heard sooooooo much about this place and finally I had the occasion to go.The place is actually pretty cool looking and not as dingy as I thought it would be. What I did not expect was the type of people there. It was quite a variety.. I expected it to be more on the alternative side.Major dislikes would include not-so-clean bathrooms, and a fight broke out in the pool table area. I can't remember the last time I was around a barroom brawl.The food is pretty good and really reasonably priced. They have a really good drink menu including a huge selection of rare beers. I got a chopped salad, but beware, it is not actually chopped...The service left a little to be desired, but wasn't bad. There were only two waitresses for the whole bar on a Saturday, so that could have something to do with it.Overall this place is pretty cool, great selection and really reasonable prices. I'll be back.
2	I always pass this place and have been in here a few times.  Uh, it sucks - no simpler way to put it.  Sure, it's trendy to go to a "british pub" and have a glass of ale.  However, if that's what you're looking for - DO NOT ENTER THIS PLACE.  The clientelle is interesting to watch but the wait staff is very slow and if you're sitting outside, be prepared for EXTREME SLOW!  Then again, maybe being outside is good because then you don't have to have your clothes soak in the INTENSE cigarette smoke that has lingered in this joint for many years.  Oh, did I mention that CEMENT TABLES outside are beyond uncomfortable?  Well, they are!  If that's not bad enough, the little holes in the middle of the tables are filled with cigarette buts.  Also, the FISH AND CHIPS are disgusting and play second fiddle to even LONG JOHN SILVERS!
4	I went somewhere tonight that I wish was George & Dragon, which made me realize that I had never written a review for one of my favorite standby restaurants.  So I wanted to give my 100th review to a place so deserving of recognition.I've been to G&D dozens of times in the past 8 years, and I can honestly say that I've never had a bad meal or bad service.  As a vegetarian, my favorite meal was always the Cornish Pasty. Mmm. Just thinking about it makes my mouth salivate.  A beautifully flaky pastry filled with potatoes and vegetables.  And peas, I love peas.  So yummy, I can't really remember many other meals there, although I do remember having a very good roast beef recently.The booths are awesome. The owner is incredibly British, and it shows.  There is a ton of authentic paraphernalia decorating these walls.  Plenty of British ales as well.  It's the standard to which I compare all British pubs in the valley.
4	Ole Ole Ole Ole!!! 6 am pints and footy.  It doesn't get much better than that.CheersUntil then, get the beers in...
2	I wish we could have met under better circumstances but the moment I walked into your establishment I wanted to vomit.  It reeked of sweaty gym socks and vinegar and there was no room at the bar.Maybe I will come back with "What Odor?" in hand and we can have a fresh beginning.
4	Damn good Fish n Chips, Chicken Curry, and Satay.  The English dinners on Sunday are very good, as well.  Good place for a pint of your favorite English ale or stout.
4	The G&D captures most of what an English pub is all about - to a great enough extent that I have actually forgotten I am in Phoenix when in there on occasion.There are some excellent beers on tap, including Abbott's Ale, IMO the best beer one can obtain in Phoenix.The English Sunday Lunch is authentic and pretty good. I won't say excellent as I cook better, but for somewhere out it is more than good enough and on a par with pubs back home - and at a VERY reasonable price.The Cornish pasties and Shepherd's Pie are 'ok', but not as seasoned as I like or cook - but a safer bet to appeal to the masses / American palettes...Dave the owner is a very nice chap and always friendly and willing to talk to people when he is there as is his brother who is often found serving behind the bar.All in all a very worthwhile place to snag a bite to eat and a pint - and play pool, darts or watch soccer on TV if they take your fancy.
5	So many reviews so I'll keep it short. I really enjoyed this place I would soooo go here often if I lived closer, like probably daily. Guiness, good food selection and Spotted Dick!! K?? K!!
4	Thanks to light rail, G&D is now within drinking distance of my house so we decided to try it.  Went for lunch on a Sunday and it was a different feel than what obviously goes on in the evenings.  The music was quiet.  The Cardinals game was on the TV.  The crowd was tame and the setting was peaceful.  Ordered the Bangers and Mash.  It was good but the mash was dry without the gravy and they added peas to the plate which it didn't need.  The sausage was great though.  Guinness on tap so that's a plus.Would go back but not during a night time crush.  Maybe when MLS season starts up.
3	At one point the George was a favorite haunt, a definite 5-star pub.  But times have changed.The George used to feature the pinnacle of excellent service, excellent beverages and delicious comfort food.  Unfortunately what's done them in is their service.  The drinks and food are still exceptional, but the service level has faltered.Really, losing 2 whole stars for degraded service?  I went in again recently after about a year hiatus and I was unfortunately reminded.  Go for the drinks, the food, the darts (real or computer) or the pool... but not for the service.
5	I've never not had a good time at George and Dragon. This place always has something fun going on whether it be karaoke, dart/pool tournaments, trivia, etc. The crowd is always a rambunctious and disorderly one, but that just makes it more fun. Eye candy is always abound here as well. I've never seen so many freshly 21 year.... wait this is a family friendly site.Drinks here are not any more expensive than other brit/irish pubs, but I always do like to order two at a time because it gets to be busy and waiting for a bartender or cocktail waitress can take a few minutes. They have three dart boards, one real and two electronic, as well as two pool tables and a couple arcade games. There is also an electronic jukebox that seems to have every song known to man.After 10+ visits I've never had any food here, so I cannot comment on that, but who eats at a place like this anyway? It's a funbar!
4	Like an old friend with an open door and a warm hug G&D is always there to feed you while getting you pleasantly sauced. The servers, by definition, are dark haired, tattooed sirens aloofly peddling the classic English fair.  The bangers and mash is enough for two, the fish 'n chips are decent but not great and if nothing else it is great that both are under ten bucks. Drinks are decently priced and they have real gingerale. (mhhh wiskey ginger) The owner either used to do tons of coke or still does because he is always frenetically bouncing around the bar talking a mile a minute to his regulars. I have been here on new years, week nights, weekends and anything in between; it is always good times. I believe there is even a lightrail stop right outside.  If you haven't been this is a must for any hardcore AZ pub-crawler.
4	it's always gooooood times at G&D. I live in an apartment complex right down the street and it's always a plus to not have to worry about assigning a DD. They carry a very wide selection of beers on tap and they are actually pretty cheap. The appetizers are pretty good too. I would definitely say the crowd is not really my scene, but once you throw a few back then you sort of forget the atmosphere. The only thing I would criticize is the service. They usually have one or two waitresses working the whole pub and if you're not sitting at the bar, you have to wait a while for service.
4	So I'm new to the city and heard about this place on the radio.The 'chap told tales of cold brews and homemade English cuisine which sparked my curiosity and my thirst, so I headed on down the 51 for some suds and spuds.Amazing pub feel with authentic techniques made the overall experience rather impressive, even more impressive was the Shepherds Pie  with brown gravy, that made my mouth scream for seconds. It lost a star because of the somewhat questionable parking lot which made me feel kinda uncomfortable during the walk out, but perhaps maybe that's just my snot side speaking.
4	I hadn't been to this pub in several years but spotted it on my first Valley Metro Rail ride.  I went straight for the Fish & Chips with a salad substitute for the chips as I have been doing lately to be more "health conscious".  The large "fried "cod was very good but the salad was ordinary head lettuce with a pink hydroponic tomato half and lone onion ring.  Otherwise, the pub experience with the assorted English, Scottish and Irish flags plus noisy crowd was reminiscent of pubs I had seen in London and Ireland.If I hadn't been riding the rail several more years could have gone by before re-visiting so the rail should help some of the restaurants over time.
5	George & Dragon is THE place to start your new year off right!  Me and my friends have a tradition of meeting up at G&D on New Years Eve to begin our new year's celebration!  We show up around 2 PM to get a booth and spend a couple of hours gearing up for the big countdown at 5 PM, which is when the new year begins in England.  Although it is always packed during the celebration, the staff is always super nice and able to keep up with the orders from our table.  Just before the countdown begins the staff passes out champagne and party favors to everyone in the bar!  We've never had a bad experience here and plan to continue our tradition for years to come!!
4	A delightful Phoenix diver bar that is even more accessible now with the opening of what this pub's owner described as the "bloody" light rail.The boisterous setting is made even more fun when the British owner announces drink specials and makes off-color jokes from his microphone. While I have not sampled most items from the menu, I have always found the wings at the George and Dragon to be a good choice.This pub is a great place to hang out with old friends or make new ones.
4	My husband and I decided to check out George and Dragon last Sunday because it was such a nice day out and we wanted to do some day drinking at a place we hadn't been before. George and Dragon it was. The patio is long but narrow with only a handful of round tables on it. However, it's still a nice place to sit with a beer and chat. After a drink on the patio, we headed inside for our next round and decided to just cozy up to the bar. The inside decor is not going to wow you at all, but I appreciate the amount of TVs they have near the bar, showing everything from women's college basketball to English Premier League soccer. I'm also a big fan of bar sports, so the pool table and dart boards in the back get a thumbs up from me as well.The draft beer selection is large...probably the largest of any of the pubs I have visited in the Valley. I believe it was about $4.75 for a pint, which is slightly cheaper than pubs like Rula Bula. The menu runs the gammet from traditional British fare to very Americanized food with very very moderate prices. Chris had a fish sandwich which he enjoyed and I had a BLT which I requested with no mayo. However, more than half way into the sandwich I realized there was mayo on it! This shocked me because normally I can always detect mayo on sandwiches as I hate it so much...so I'm not sure what G&D did, but they snuck mayo past me and I still loved the sandwich! The fries that came with the sandwiches were tasty. Our bill  (before tip) after five pints of beer, an appetizer, and two sandwiches came to $40.The two bartenders that waited on us were incredibly friendly and quick. From the signs I saw inside, it looks like Sunday-Thursday, they do a reverse happy hour starting at 11 pm with 2 for 1 well drinks. I love the laid back vibe of G&D and the booths look comfy, so I will be back.
4	I had spotted dick!!!!!!!  Its not what your thinking pervs.  It was a dessert.  It is bread putting with currants in it.  What can I say English food and English beers how gross!!!  I am not a fan of either..  But hey they do have a full bar and good burgers and chicken tenders.  Plus, everything is reasonably priced especially for the size of the drinks they serve.  The atmosphere is pretty cool with all the English decor, big booths and the eclectic group of patrons.  Some still seem like they are stuck in the 80's listing to their metal bands but hey that is why I like living downtown because you see all types which is cool.
2	I visited G&D during the Light Rail Pub Crawl. When we walked in, my crew headed straight to the bar. The bar was almost empty so we sat down and waited to be acknowledged by the bartender.... and we waited...and waited until finally I had to get rude and say "Can we get some service here or no?" The tender looked at us like we had just appeared there out of thin air. Ok, I will let that pass. Maybe she was overwhelmed. We ordered our beers and I had to catch her to get a couple menus. Then I had to yell to her that we were ready. Did she just not want our money that day? Were they full up on cash? I ordered the pasty appetizer while my partners ordered hot wings and a basket of chips. My pasty was tasty. I was starving so I'm not sure about authenticity or flavor. They were tasty and HOT on the inside. I thought they were ok. I had to ask for another round of drinks for us even though our empty glasses were staring our lovely bartender right in the face. I don't know if one goes to G&D for a great dining experience, but we were thirsty and wanted beers as well so our service fell short there too. I was told that a good time to go is in the evening and not to sit at the bar. I'll try that if I ever visit G&D again.
4	Good french dip. Great bloody mary.
2	As part of my hard cider tour of Phoenix it was inevitable that I would end up at the George and Dragon.   Our visit was on a Sunday, mid afternoon, so I'm basically reviewing the food  and not the whole UK pub experience which I usually rate poorly having escaped the bloody country in the first place:) E.g this is 15 plus years of eating 2-3 times a week in bars as the yardstick I'm taking a swing with.  Firstly the good parts.  Their spicy wings, boy do they deliver.  It's  at minimum a heavy vinegar / buffalo sauce   , thai chilis? and enough of the seeds to make my wife's nostrils clear from accross the table.  Boy these where nicely done, full and a fricking bargain. For this and the cider alone  I'm returning. Then the meal.I had an awful hankering for offal but alas the steak and kidney pie was mispelled and I ended up with a steak and kidney piece.  There are so few places that do this dish and seemingly none that do this well. Ok I can do without  large lumps of kidney  but  not without the taste. This thing was thick and herby to the point that  calling a  thyme out would have been useful. This took the 4 to a 3.  WIfey's yorkshire pudding was burned ( not that hard admittedly) but  the roast beef  didn't appear to have been roasted, least on site. It's like Birds Eye boil in the bag roast beef simmered in gravy.There was zero indication the outer surface had been  exposed to dry heat of anykind  and we think we know where to get it :) If it's not then  they really suck at roast beef.  That and it didn't come with the horseradish on the menu. Service, pleasant but kinda slow .For the food  2.5  rounded down to 2 because It's really not OK  to have two main dishes fall so far short of pub food.
2	I've always wanted to try this place after I heard their weird radio commercials a few years back.  It always cracked me up whenever the guy talked about the bangers and mash.  We finally stopped by one day after a lovely little trip on the lightrail.The entrance is a little confusing being on the south side of the building.  I guess this is because I am used to entrances being in the fronts of buildings as opposed to on the side.  When you walk in, you see everything you expect.  A couple pool tables, dingy floors, a seedy looking bar, and tables and chairs scattered about.  There are a decent amount of booths as well.  One thing that I noticed and considered a bit odd was the fact that a third of the restaurant seemed to be sort of partitioned off for the "fancy" dining area.  I don't know if that is the case, but it definitely looked that way.  When it comes down to it, this place is a classically tacky pub type restaurant, and I like it.Unfortunately, the food is not so great.  Neither is the bitchy service you get when you come in.  A half smile would be a welcome gesture instead of a perfect view of my server skulking in the kitchen.  I'm not sure what was up with that.  Maybe PMS.  The husband ordered the bangers and mash and I got the cornish pastie.  The husband mentioned that he had to add a lot of salt to his gravy, but he seemed to enjoy his meal.  Me on the other hand, not so much.  My gigantic pile of peas that kept rolling of my plate were cold and had a few hairs in them.  They definitely weren't mine, I checked.  The pastie was delicious, and I really liked it, but the accompanying mashed potatoes were too thick and lumpy to be any good.This place just isn't good enough.  Hair in food is just plain gross.  Mediocre food combined with rude service is not going to get me to come back.  Besides, I am sick and tired of hearing the owner of this place bitch and moan about the lightrail being a detriment to his business.  I don't know how you can say that when the place is packed on a Sunday afternoon with no sporting events going on.
4	So here it was Lenten season and Friday.  I was starving and in a city not like New Orleans in its available seafood fare!  What to do?  Remember that the British are  known for one food contribution....Fish and chips!  So you get on your bike and speed over to the place you've heard you can have a pastie, a sausage roll, and a steak and kidney pie on a regular footie day.  And Fish and Chips and a Strongbow Ale on a post  Mardi Gras Friday night!  And this place reeks of British wanna-bes and malt vinegar.  I think I even saw the reflection of the Queen Vic in the pool or urine out back!
5	Riding the light rail daily to work has changed how I go about my commute home. It was by the grace of a good friend that I stopped off for a happy hour special at a Midtown drinkery. That's all it took to get me hooked on the idea of stopping off for a drink after a hard day's work. And the proximity of George & Dragon to the light rail launched what is my current obsession.With good intentions, I stopped at G&D yesterday for an Irish Car Bomb and a Guinness, and to get some food to take home and watch a movie. At 5:15 there was hardly anybody there, but I suppose most people are commuting at that time. I overheard another patron ask about their "Slay The Dragon" program. Participants, it so happens, are given a card with all of the restaurant's beer listed. The steady drinker consumes one of each (there are 66 different beers!!) within a month and is awarded with an "I Slayed the Dragon" t-shirt. What a sweet concept! ***The steak and kidney pie was also a nice treat, with that certain crispness of the kidney strong but not overpowering. In the past, I've also gotten the fish and chips (FanTasTic!), bangers and mash (excellent) and the wings (very good).*** I think it would be swell if we organized a daily UYE to help each other through this beer challenge. Even if it's only done during happy hour (4-7) after work,  that's only 3-4 beers a day.
3	Had to bump G&D up to an A-ok status. My advice: Don't sit at the bar. Get a table where a cool waitress will help you even when it's crazy busy! Bumped up one star due to better service!
3	This place is decent.  I live within walking distance but have only been once if that tells you anything.  It's just normal pub grub, and none of it is really impressive.  The slay the dragon program is kind of fun, although I haven't made much of a dent in my card because I never go.  Supposedly they have quiz night on Thursdays which might cause me to up my star rating...
4	I like the G&D.  The food is good, the waitresses are pretty, its a fun atmosphere.I always like the shepards pie but there are lots of tasty things about and some of them are hard to find outside of Britain. (Try the scotch egg if you feel adventurous).
4	I really want to give the George & Dragon 5 stars, between the last time we were there and our server was awesome.  The Awesome Local Pub/ Football Hooligan bar atmosphere they provide, and the Owners and the the british expat company they keep who are characters in and of themselves.  the G&D is truly an experience.  Unfortunately on our last visit our waitress seemed to have horse blinders on, on several occasions we waved, we raised our hands, we yelled at her back and somehow she just didn't make eye contact or acknowledge that we were trying to get her attention.  despite somewhat unresponsive service we were still able to get drinks regularly enough throughout the night..I also tried the food for the first time, it felt fitting to order the fish and chips, the chips are just steak fries with no memorable qualities,  however the fish was I believe cod, but the batter was very tasty and crispy, it was served with a side of coleslaw that wasn't bad either.overall the atmosphere in this place is awesome, and the british expats that hang around the bar make it that much more convincing.  I'm confident that the incident we had with service was just that "an incident" and it's possible the waitress was just spread thin or stressed.  I'm confident our next visit will be fine, because I enjoy going to this bar.
5	I've been going here for years. See in 1999 I went to the UK on my first trip across the pond, came back missed it, and was invited to G&D. This place reminded me of what it was like in England and I loved it. The first couple of years my problem with going was the smoke but after Phoenix (& AZ) went smokefree the restaurant cleaned up quickly. The left side is all pool tables and darts. My best friend and I spent many nights with a beer and a game of darts here. The right side is a restaurant section where you can sit down to have a great dinner. This section is large enough to easily accommodate a group dinner as we did often.The beers here are great and the variety is exceptional. For the food, I always get the same exact thing. Shepherd Pie is my favorite, and I have seriously never had better (even in the UK). It's perfect with cheese & HP sauce. You just can't get any better than George & Dragon on Central.
3	Returned for the wings and cider as promised then decided to stay for another meal, just to be fair:) Wings again nicely hot, though not as insanely so as the last time, but appeared to have been brought up to heat twice. -1.5  star I  never want to  pay for reheats , especially when it has a deleterious effect on the food. This may work for soup, not so well for fish  /  wings.  The pastie ,mash and peas were quite good though.   Service much faster than our prior  experience too. Wife loved her fish and chips  , pretty happy on the zucchini appetizer, and just ok with the "touch" of Guiness in the cider that threatened to take over the glass.    3.5 rounded down to 3.  Hey that's one better than prior.
2	Being born in the UK to a long line of English, Welsh, Irish and Scots, so there's nothing more I'd like than for a good Brit pub to thrive in PHX.That said, this place has the bones and makes an attempt, but falls short. It's kinda divey, but that's fine.  The beer selection is great.  The crowd is diverse.  Good music, lots of sports on the TV, etc.On the flip side:The staff has good intentions, but is not well trained.  They do the job, but don't anticipate - you have to ask.  They don't seem empowered.  We ordered some happy hour food at 6:55, for example, and they said it was over.  It wasn't 7, but they explained the "computers" made the call.  This wasn't something we brought up at 10 p.m. - but before it was 7!   A guy next to us ordered food to go and sat there for 40 minutes.  He kept asking and the response was "it wasn't up" but then he got mad and it magically appeared all boxed and ready.  Bottom line:  service is o.k. for a bar, but the food thing seems to flummox them.The menu covers a wide range of bases, but also is a series of hits and misses.  We went one weekend for the Sunday Roast.  It was a generous plate of veggies, mash and a massive yorkshire pud.  But the beef wasn't roast anything... more like steak-ums.  The gravy was from a can/jar.   Now some might say this is trivial, but a good Sunday Roast Beef meal to the English is like a Thanksgiving dinner in the US.  You can't serve shaved turkey from a frozen bag and surround it with good sides... the main dish needs to be lovingly prepared.On another night, the Scotch eggs followed the same theme.  A great idea.  The dish was served with a wide range of extras, but the core food was odd.  Not bad, but the casing was an inch thick and dry.I'd love to see this place work.  They offer a menu of what should be made, but just don't quite deliver a good food product.  To be fair, the market might not support it and are happy with ho hum stuff, but on the flip side I've enjoyed much more inspired fare in CA - not just the U.K.
2	DH & I went for dinner there tonight, we had a veggie pasty and the crust was nice & flaky but the stuffing of the pasty was tasteless, peas were tasteless, mashed potatoes & gravy, weren't very good either. Beer selection was good, but food was terrible.
4	The George is always a good time..  Drinks are reasonable, food is good.  The sports selection last night was atrocious, but I am not ready to blame the George for that.  Trivia is fun on Thursdays, but sometimes a bit tough to hear..Staff was friendly and responsive.  Never had to wait long for a drink.Go when there are good sports on for the rowdy atmosphere, especially if you like football (soccer)
3	This is more like dungeons and dragons, it is so freaking dark in there. They have some good food, decent service. Nothing stands out just ok. The owner is a goof ball and trys to hit on every women in the place.
2	Jonathan E.'s review is spot-on. I went here for a late lunch on a Sunday and couldn't resist ordering the lamb. I was expecting a hearty hunk of roast leg of lamb, as the menu mentioned the Sunday Roasts selection. Instead, the meat was merely thin-shaved slices of lamb (with plenty of fat to trim away) with gravy. The sides were o.k., but overall this dish was disappointing.If I must eat here again, I'll order the fish and chips, although I was a bit dismayed to see that malt vinegar was not brought automatically to the table. And although we submitted three orders of fish and chips, our server brought back two and had to be reminded that we were expecting a third. This meant everybody ate while one poor sod in our group had to wait patiently for his order to be placed (again). Fortunately, we split a Scotch egg as an appetizer and that tided him over, but it was not much of a treat.
5	Guinness got me drunk-My waiter was efficient .We both wish we had [becky] though. Beer gets ya drunk-Bombshell! Bad Ass! Looking &  Acting Servers!-Go out have a good time, don't be a tool-George & dragon has a good vibe.Support this place and its staff.First time here, not the last!Donkey-[[Eaaawwwwwe Eaaawwwwwe]]
1	I like the look of this place. The food was not good and actually made me and my friend very sick. Bathroom was SCARY and non air conditioned. I really wanted to like this place but it just wasn't good. I liked the atmosphere other than the bathroom.. I could drink here but wont eat here again.
5	The bartenders always know how make interesting shots!  Plus they have their "Slay the dragon" t-shirt for drinking all the beers.  Yeah...the shirt itself isn't amazing, but I'm down for any drinking contest.I love the cranky old man owner.  He's a Man U fan so he's even better!  Go Red Devils!
3	I want to love this place, truly I do.  The food is tasty and sticks to your ribs, and the drinks are cheap and strong.  HOWEVER, practically every time I've gone there I've been harassed by this creepy old man that NEVER leaves.  He is there everyday.  Most people consider him charming, but after he leered at me and made lewd comments about my boobs..I don't know.  I suppose it would be fine if I brought a man friend along as opposed to my usual girl troop, but I just get the chills whenever I think of that place now.
4	The post-party for the Switch OYE was here. Even if there were only 8 of us. We came just in time for trivia night. Which is apparently a big deal here. I LOVE trivia with useless factoids, so I felt right at home. 40 questions really tries the useless knowledge portion of the brain. Which in my case is most of it. Unfortunately I was already a little sauced and was 3 more beers deep by the time we were done. It was a great time, including war paint. We scored 28 out of 40. I am going back soon to redeem myself. Georgie S, are you down?  We also created a new game that works when Nikki F is there.  If she starts to fall asleep, someone says her name and then rest of the table, in unison, must yell her name again.  Good clean fun!I like the decor. There are authentic European football jerseys and scarves all over the place. Rugby too. A couple of side notes. 1 star deduction for, what I am guessing was a manager, coming over and telling us we were being too loud and disruptive. WTF?!!! We are in an English pub, with a lot of beer, drunk people, playing a competitive trivia game. Are you serious!? I was dumb founded and I think I may have talked back to this dude. Couldn't believe it. I have started my "Slay the Dragon" card. Only 61 more beers to earn my shirt. Starting to train now. Sorry for the pic post Nathan S, I had too.
3	Well this is the English pub to go to in Phoenix.  With that said this city is without much culture so there's not much competition here.   I have to say this place is just ok.  Inside is outdated, but comes with the territory.  Beer selection is great, food is about average.   Service is a little below average.  I have been here at least a half dozen times and have yet to not have a struggle to get a drink order in.  And I have never been here on a Friday, Saturday, or a busy night for that matter.  I guess unless you are a regular the bartenders don't pay much attention to the rest of the customers.  Location sucks unless you are at an event at Steele Indian School Park or maybe doing a light rail pub crawl.  Too far away from Downtown and not close enough to Camelback(Midtown).  Not a must see, but if your eyeballs want to see something different I say go for it.
4	Went last night for the USA vs. Honduras soccer match.  At first the feed wasn't working but after most people left I stuck around and got a front row seat and then the feed came on.  Was a great game and great environment all cheering for the Yanks except two behind me from Honduras.  I ate the potato skins which were pretty good and had some great 4 Peaks Kiltlifter beer.  Cheap tab and a USA win good way to spend a Saturday night.
4	A couple of friends and I participated in the Phoenix Actually' Great Phoenix Scavenger Hunt meeting up at the George & Dragon. The location was good - right on Central, close to light rail access. Parking was descent in the back. The bar was spacious with pool tables & darts in the entry room, plenty of seating in the dining around and around the bar. It was big enough to accomodate all of the scavengers as well as those patrons wondering what all of these other folks are doing.Before the scavenger hunt started my friend ordered an Ace Apple Cider. I ordered one as well and it was very sweet. That drink would be dangerous because I could pound those all night not realizing it was alcohol. We made it back to the George & Dragon a little early (8:30)...still 30 minutes left in the scavenger hunt, but the web site to upload pics to was slow, so we decided to enjoy some apps and drinks at the bar. The appetizers were typical bar food - we ordered the mozzerella sticks, potato skins and another round of Ace Apple Cider. Typical, but tasty. The cheese sticks were very cheese and the 'skins were good. The plate game with a few garnishes of vegetables as well. The service was excellent too. We were going to order the shrimp, but the waitress indicated there really isn't that many, so perhaps another selection would be better. She was very prompt despite the large crowd. I left a good tips due to the attentiveness and advice.I love pubs in general and would definitely go back any time.
4	I've eaten here many times over my life and have always enjoyed the food there.However, I went this past Saturday around 2pm and there was some sort of poker tournament going on with top 40 music playing over the speakers. Not really setting the English pub mood, so that was disappointing. But the food was still good and the service was decent, so real complaints. I had the bangers and mash dinner and my mother had a Cornish pastie appetizer. The sausage was excellent with brown gravy and onions and the potatoes were very creamy. Go for the food, not for the atmosphere.
4	I stopped by George and Dragon for lunch a couple of days ago. It was the first time I had been in the place for many years. Unfortunately, I was at work so I could not drink alcohol, but the food was great. I had fish and chips and my co-worker had bangers and mash. The fish was some of the best I've had, and the person with me enjoyed his food as well. The prices were decent, and the service was great. Even though I was not drinking this time, I could not help but notice the excellent selection of draft beers. I really wish I was closer so I could have some booze at this place. Alas, I live in Ahwatukee. For those of you who are closer and enjoy the pub atmosphere, George and Dragon is highly recommended, though I imagine the place is a zoo when there's a big soccer match. The last time I was here I was not impressed, and had not been back since. But this last visit was wonderful. Either something changed, or I just caught them on a bad day last time.
4	G&D was our first stop for our Pub Crawl, the fried food sampler was good and the drinks were decent pour and priced. The server was nice and everything went well. The location is lose to a rail station with just a short walk.
4	Hello all!  This place is great.  I went to high school right down the street and have lived in the neighborhood forever.  You can always have a good time.  Good atmosphere, great beer, and great location.Why I didn't give it 5 stars:  Well, they have this slay the dragon thing...if you can drink all the beers on this paper they give you, not all at once, although I guess I would try that...but, you are suppose to get a T-shirt that says, "I slaid the Dragon".  Well, the problem is, they don't keep all the beers in stock so...boo.Also, it kind of is a two-faced place...one Friday you'll go there and you wont be able to park and there will be standing room only inside...but the next Friday it's dead.But, please go check it out, it's really awesome and the owners are knows to mingle with the crowed, can't miss them, they're the ones with the English accents.  CHEERS!
4	Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):7 Food10 *Drinks*9 Service9 Atmosphere10 ValueI'm sorry, but $3 Jagerbombs ALL the time?  $39 later, I decided that that's a 10 on Value.And the rare Tetley's beer on tap?  That's a 10 on Drinks.If only the food wasn't so British, I could rate the food better  =p
4	The George is one of a kinda, well there is a second location, but so not even close. I have been going to the George for years, always have a great time. Usually go to play poker on Tuesday, Wednesday or Saturdays. I have also taken part in their trivia nights on Thursdays too. They have great food, their wings and Sheppard's Pie are my faves! Tons of beers on tap. They even have this fun little game where you can "Slay the Dragon." Where you have to drink at least one of every beer they have in the place, upwards of 50 I think. I know some people that have tried. I believe the record is 3 and half days to finish them all. My friends and I dropped by the George the other night as one of our Holiday Bar Crawl stops along the light rail. They had a live band playing, who were pretty fun. We got drinks fast, the customers and staff we friendly and we had a great time. Such a great time we ended up staying a bit longer than we had planed.
4	G&D is one of those places that I just "end up" at.. its centralized between me and all my friends, and they have everything you could ever need .. so its wicked convenient. Trivia, Karaoke, TV's, Beer, Wings, Scotch Eggs, Pool tables, cigarette machines, children running around screaming.. you name it, they probably have it. The first time I came here was for trivia night.. it was dramatic and everyone was cheating, but the loaded potato app. made everything all right in my world.The second time I came here was after the Switch OYE, which I totally don't remember.. as Brad E.'s review noted, there was a game that involved me falling asleep sitting up and everyone screaming my name as loudly as possible to interrupt my slumber, or something.... There was also war paint and apparently I ran into some co-workers.. I didn't believe them until a photo surfaced. I will say no more.The third time I came here was for Georgie S.' 8th 26th birthday celebration. We actually came here twice, once for after brunch boozing, and the second time to sing Karaoke, but mostly we just listened to Nathan S. serenade us for 3 hours.. football was on, many beers were consumed, the photos reflected a happy setting and im pretty sure the bday girl was pleased with her final celebration. At least, it was supposed to be the final. I'm pretty sure it wasn't. The 5th time I came here was last night.. for football and beers. As always, I was content and happy, enjoying myself and the wedding reception debauchery (yes there was really a wedding reception here) that was going on..I just generally enjoy this place, there is always parking, its right off the rail, the bathrooms are gross, but manageable, food is actually really good for bar-fare, especially the English selections.. Great beer selection, KILTLIFTER WHAAAAT, full bar, always an interesting crowd and everyone is always having a great time. Totally come here. Me and my friends will probably be there too.
1	My husband lived in England and had a strong reccomendation on this place because of the food.  We didn't make it that far.  When we walked in everything look dirty- the floors, walls, booths, pool tables - and the place was dimly lit!  I could not believe this bar served food.  Nothing about it said restaurant.  The decor was everything British which may have been cute if they took a rag and wipe the dust off.  No one greeted us when we walked in so we just sat down at a table.  There was a waitress wandering around that looked just as lost as we did.  She finally came over and gave us some menus, took our drink order and that was it... we never saw her again.  While we waited we had a while to look over the menu.  All the British food sounded like some type of variation of pot roast.  I guess that's what British cuisine consists of but none of it sounded appealing.  Still waiting it gave me more time to look around and I started to get angry because I couldn't believe I was about to order food from such a dirty establishment (I could only imagine what the kitchen looked like).  I was shocked to see kids running around... I wouldn't take Bebe's kids in there. I clocked it; for 15 minutes we sat there without food or drinks, just menus.  Our booth faced the bar and the bartenders looked at us a few times but never sent anyone over to our table. Could I have asked for our server?  Sure.  But by this point I knew I wasn't spending a dime here and wanted to see how long it would take someone to come over to us so I could tell what I thought of their service.  Finally we receded, parched and starving we got up and left the George & Dragon.  What a waste of time!
1	please tear this place down.
2	I've only been here once and it was OK. If you're into the English pub scene, you would probably like it since everything is decently priced. However, a friend of mine tells me that they broke into her car on a Friday night, smashed the window and all, so I would be careful about what you leave in your vehicle.
5	I've been to GND a couple of times and I am always pleased with the service there. The food is good, especially the shepard's pie, and the beer is cheap. I would recommend that people should check this place out and if you do you won't be disappointed.
5	I love the Pub! I don't get there very often any more but I wish I could! Trivia Night (Thursdays) is a blast! They have a Great Beer Selection, Fantastic Drink Prices, and it is always a Good time!
4	This is my kinda place.   Nice casual place with good food and good beer.  Not to mention it is walking distance from the Central/Indian School lightrail station.  I stopped in here on a whim while spending a Saturday on the lightrail ( I made good use of my day pass).  I had also read at one time this pub served Scotch Eggs, mmmm.   As it was dinner time-ish I ordered up a Smithwicks and some Scotch Eggs.  Now I have had these served a variety of ways in the past and my preference is lightly breaded yet crisp crust with a relatively thick layer of sausage, served room temp to slightly warm.   Here they are served cold and quartered.  These were also some of the largest Scotch eggs I have had.  I got over the fact they were as cold as they were and begin to enjoy the flavor of the sausage layer with a hint of nutmeg.  The balsamic "chutney" served  with them was great, in the past at other places I usually enjoy a course deli mustard. What I didn't like about these Scotch eggs was the breaded layer.  Becasue they are premade fried and stored in the fridge the breaded layer was like a rubber mat.  I peeled off this layer and continued to enjoy my meal.
3	I've only been here once & so far I'm indifferent. If I never come back I'll really only miss the coleslaw. The coleslaw got this place 3 stars instead of 2.A friend asked me to go on a Mon which is karaoke night. I don't inflict my terrible singing on others, but I did enjoy most of the other people singing.I played a couple games of pool on 1 of the 2 tables while waiting for my food.The main bartender was not a pleasant person. Words like "sweetie" don't disguise impatient, judgmental body language. I can't remember seeing her smile once. She made me uncomfortable. The other girls working there were smiley & nice looking. I also saw the general manager chilling outside.Call me a cheap ass but I feel like I paid too much for fish & chips. Came out to $14.02. I expected to pay $10ish. I know it's market price & all but that still sucked. I should have asked the price before ordering.The fish & chips were really good though. I could barely finish the 2 thick pieces of fish on my plate. They were perfectly crispy with just the right amount of batter. Chips could have been crispier though.I LOVE THE COLESLAW! I can't say that enough. It wasn't sweet (yuck!) like other coleslaws I've tried. It was crisp & peppery. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. HmmmWhen you order a shot I think you get more liqueur than just a shot because of their glasses. They're wide & the bartender wasn't measuring, she just eye balled it. Don't pay more ordering doubles since you're probably pretty much already getting that originally.There are heaters above on the patio. Your top 1/2 will be warm while your bottom 1/2 might get cold.There's 1 bathroom for girls. No stalls. If someone's in there you'll have to wait your turn. At least it wasn't filthy & smelly.
2	this was my first visit &I will NEVER go back I will NEVER go backI will NEVER go backI will NEVER go backI will NEVER go backI will NEVER go backkicking, dragging, screaming I will NEVER go backordered fish & chips, shepherd's pie & steak 'n kidney pie & beersfish & chips = blah, nothing special or memorable, just plain cheap cod that was NOT cheap in $shepherd's pie = this was not shepherd's pie it was cottage pie and it was bland, tasteless, boring!steak 'n kidney pie = where was the kidney?(chips = blah)If you have nothing to compare 'traditional British' food to, then you may consider it good, (except for the bland COTTAGE Pie)!!!  Only reason they got two stars is that the bartender/service wasn't awfully terrible.I ask one question; do 'you' pay more attention to 'your' regulars?  OR, do 'you' pay more attention to the newbies so they want to be regulars?oh, & $5/beer....?& it's dirty, all the decor...cause it's never been cleaned/dusted since 1995.
5	G&D is my local bar.  Full disclosure - the owner is my friend, but that's a natural byproduct of how this place is run.  I know many of the people that I toss 'em back with a few nights a week here, and the clientele cuts a wide swath - doctors, lawyers, and Indian chiefs, if you will, to regular folks like me.  A lot of the knocks on the place I won't disavow - it's dim and not sparkling, but so what?  If that's a huge turn-off, you're better off elsewhere.  I like to think the place has personality.  But if you like a huge selection of beer (including Boddington's, Kronenbourg, and Chimay) and good food, you'll probably have a good time here.  The food's not frou-frou and "foodie" - it's just good.  My favorite bar in Phoenix - no place I'd rather get pissed.
2	G&D was a sad day for me. Have been super excited to check this place out because A. it looks Cool and B. friends have told me how awesome it is But alas I have to give it a C.... We took the lightrail downtown for a Rattlers game and afterwards hit G&D for a drink and snacks afterwards.   It was really busy because of the hockey game being on so we couldn't find anywhere to sit in the bar area or even get to the bar to order a drink... so we found a table tucked in the corner in the "restaurant" side... only probably here was service.. no one cared about those eating food!    We only had about 10 mins to look at a menu and order before the kitchen closed at 11 so we had to track down a waitress to take our order.Menu for food was quite typical.  Fish Sandwich, Burgers, etc.  Friends enjoyed it.. but also had a few beers in, so I cant say its more than any other "bar food"  I only ordered the chips and salsa which were less than adequate... straight from the store, nothing special at all.    I think this place could have been a lot better if we had better service and were in the bar area which is clearly the "cool" part.
4	My dad was in town visiting and we wanted to go to Pizzeria Bianco, but oh no, that was not in the cards, with its hoity-toity hour and a half wait and all. We cruised Central for half an hour, before pulling into this parking lot, mainly because of low blood sugar, and also because our Ulster roots compelled us, I suppose. How was I to know that had inadvertantly stumbled into the dirty dive pub wonderland I've been waiting for? We waddled through a sea of barflies, hipsters and cardplayers waiting for the Tuesday night poker game, and settled into a large corner booth, and pored over the impressive beer menu.  We both stuffed ourselves, had a couple of pints, and talked over our family business for hours.  We had a fantastic time, and were adequately attended to. We also got to watch the card game begin, which was pretty funny.George & Dragon satisfied both parties.  My dad was psyched on the British pub food offerings, the huge array of beers on tap, and what was sure to be an impressive turnout for the World Cup broadcast... and I was impressed by the dingy crowd and the sheer dive-y-ness of it all... something that the East Valley, where I (sniff) hang my hat, is seriously lacking in.Considering that we could not have chosen this place more randomly, it now seems fated.  Now I just have to figure out how I'm going to get myself all the way across town and all the way back home so I can get appropriately intoxicated while I am there.
5	The G&D is ab fab!came in on a sunday afternoon, and it was deserted save for the brit publican who in his charming way that only a bloke from across the pond could muster guessed by our appearances just which brews we would favor, to my brother an ice cold pint of newcastle, and to me a frosty kronenbourg. After a few pints were knocked back we hit the billiards table at a mere .50 cents a game! my heart swelled! then after the pints a tasty round of fish and chips. The beer battered north atlantic cod was among some of the biggest fillets of cod i have ever eaten! delicious and meaty the succulent white fish and fat thumb sized chippies were just what the doc ordered! after a few pints and a hearty meal my tab was under $30! loved the place and will probably jump off the lightrail for a quick pint and a pool game any time im riding down central.
4	I have never been to the UK, so I don't know how to compare what I ate to traditional English food.  I know that what I ordered, the pastie, was very delicious, as was the peas that came with it.  My husband and daughter split the Shepard's Pie and they both loved it.  Great beer as well.  I saw some other customers with the fish and chips and they looked great-I think next time that will be what I get.  The decor was aged and a little dusty, but all in all, it was a really good meal.
3	The food is okay, the trivia is fun but they don't even know what  crown float is.  This is an English pub you say?  Pshaw.
5	Great surprise. The steak pie was awesome!
1	Have been to this place twice and the experience was the same. I personally don't get what draws people to this place. It's got a bit of a negative vibe. The staff is not friendly or service oriented and it's dirty. Great location for a light rail pub crawl - I think it just might not be our crowd.
4	Huge wings!  Delish!  Great beer selection. Good environment. If you are reading this you've probably already been there so this is nothing new.
2	The food was just ok,  the beer was overpriced, and the service was sub-par.  I've been there twice and the first time I actually stuck around to eat and drink.  On the second trip, we waited at the table 30 minutes with no service, then finally left.  I will not go back.
3	A great place to hang out and chill with peeps after work. The fish and chips is kinda pricey but the restaurant gave great portion of the fries and I was able to share with friends. G&D had a great selection of beer and my fave is the Kilt Lifter. Love it!
4	For reasons unknown, I have a bias against English food. So when the plates I saw coming out of the kitchen were a bit unappealing, I knew this place was authentic. This place looks a bit old, but not trashy. When I ordered my Jameson and ginger ale, being asked if I'd like it in a pint glass made my day. This bar is awesome. There's a nice selection of beers for a reasonable $5 a pint. I had some Ace Pear, but there were tons of ales I'd never heard of to choose from. I'll be back for those.There are plenty of activities to keep busy while getting trashed here. I've never seen so much room in a bar devoted to dartboards. It was right in the corner with ample throwing room, and I loved it! There are also a couple billiards tables, some light gun arcade game (Try it after a few--don't shoot the cows!) and even some patrons sitting at poker tables. I'm definitely coming back here to play darts and watch rugby. Maybe I'll even try their fish and chips. I wonder though...do Brits really hang out here?
2	I have a somewhat love-hate relationship with the George. It used to be my Friday night bar for months. I always preferred it's dingy, dive-likeness over the pretentious, lame Scottsdale bars near where I live. Sometimes I miss camping out on the patio in the back corner, chain smoking with friends and people watching but the George has lost it's charm for me. My purse was stolen the one and only time I didn't bring it with me to the bathroom. I did leave it with a group of dudes thinking it would be safe but no. I've seen three arrests out front. One time these junkie looking dudes were licking each other's hands in front of the patio until the cops came. I've seen a girl pee her pants INSIDE the bathroom and then proceed to slip on the sidewalk which was wet from the misters nearly cracking her head open. Many, many stories came from that place. My last visit was months ago and I couldn't wait to leave. It's just not fun anymore. So long, George.
4	all hail the brits, summer hours and day drinking benders with my brother. oi, oi, oi!my brother joey calls me up one day: "hey, can you drive me downtown tomorrow?"me: "why?"joey: "i have school down there in the afternoon, but i was invited to go bar hopping after class tomorrow night with some friends. i don't want leave my car out there overnight if i'm going to be drinking."me: "well, my company lets us have summer hours on fridays, so i'm done with work at noon. when's your class?"joey: "not til 6pm... but we can go earlier and grab beers or lunch first at this british pub near my school."me: "done. pick you up at 1:30pm." click.now this was in early august, so it was blazing hot that day. i pull into the george & dragon parking lot a bit dismayed there was no covered parking. oh sweaty joy.the good news is, it's nice and cool inside and strangely crowded for a work day.  we find seats right up at the bar. i notice the girls working there all have this suicide girl thing going on and the one guy we see working there (who appeared to be the manager?) has this MASSIVE pompadour thing going on with his hair. it was larger than life... like that thing you try not to stare at, but can't help it. in my peripheral vision, i could see my brother look over at me. i knew exactly what he was thinking and i smirk. then mr. pompadour-manager guy comes right over to us and asks if we would like menus. my brother smiles and nods a yes at him, fighting back laughter. while we're pouring over the menu's we order some pints. i decided that i fancied a kiltlifter while my brother orders the fuller esb. i try a sip of his, and crikey it's good. they're extra cold too and go down smooth. i end up ordering the fish & chips with the cole slaw and my brother opts for the sheperd's pie. my brother, never one for being a wimpy little nancy boy decides to order a shot of whiskey with this next round. i get the boddingtons this time, he gets the harp. me: "um, don't you have class? won't you be knackered by the time 6pm rolls around if you do a shot of whiskey?"joey: "nah, i'll be fine. we just have a quick test and then we can leave. i'll ace it."me: "well, cheers to that then."  *i raise my glass, clink*finally our food comes...... and i only have 2 words for the perfectly golden crispiness of the fish and chips i had for lunch: DAMN GOOD.we finished off our grub just as this cheeky lady and her husband sit down next to us. we chat them up over more pints (i have water, because i'm driving) until 6pm rolls around. i visit the bathroom upon our departure and am happy to report while initially it looks a bit dodgy, it's actually quite clean. we wave goodbye to mr pompadour-manager and we're off.i found out later my brother got an A on that test. HA. figures.good show george & dragon, all hail the queen! cheerio.
3	Can I say that the food is great?  Not really, I will say however that you don't go for the food, you go for trivia nights.  You go for the friendship.  You go for the dart boards and pool tables.  The shepard's pie is heavy but hits the spot, can't go wrong with fish and chips, the rest of it is meh.  Great place to watch World Cup when it rolls around, music is good and is good watering hole for when you feel the need to catch up with your mates.   Just don't look too closely at the carpets....
4	This place has gotten under my skin.I have been going there since shortly after they opened back in 1995 or so. It's been a landmark to me through much of my adult life. I've met the owner a few times and he's very personable.So how is it? It's good. It's a pub that's nicely dark inside. The bar is comfortable, and they have British beer on tap--stuff like Boddington's. The food is tasty and reliable. Stick with the specialties--the shepherd's pie, bangers and mash, cornish pasties, roast beef.I've never found a reason to complain about the service.There's a community built up around it, and you can occasionally meet real, live, BRITISH PEOPLE there! Imagine that!So, a favorite of mine.
4	Where else would you go to get Corn Beef and Cabbage on St. Patricks Day.  Love it, music check, staff check, central location check.  What eles oh Guinness on tap, double check.
4	Sometimes I am a little embarrassed to admit it, but I love the George & Dragon. The service can be a little slow, and the servers a little spacey, but the owner is super friendly and the bar's vibe is "the more the merrier". The bar has some entertaining activities, like poker and trivia nights, and fantastic wings (spicy and tart). Plus the kitchen is open late.  This is a great place to spend the evening throwing back beers with good friends!
4	The food is your typical bar nonesense, but it's cheap and the atmosphere is good.  Easy parking, close, good happy hour.  Come for Thursday trivia night if you want to meet people.
2	I really want to give this local gem a chance but I was not too pleased with my last experience.  Some friends and I had planned to attend the Beerfest in Phoenix.  The rain drove us to wait it out at George & Dragon's.  Unfortunately the staff were not prepared for the amount of customers that would hid from the rain that day.  As I could see there was one bartender and one waitress.  We couldn't get a drink or even order food.  After patiently waiting for 20 minutes we left this establishment and headed to another local pub.  I've heard so many great things about this place but this day I left very disappointed.
4	A place for REAL people, not snobs or Scottsdale thousandairs.Simply put, some of the best fish & chips I have ever had the pleasure of tasting.  Fish is fluffy and batter is CRISP and golden.  Steak fries are perfectly fried and not greasy.  The cole slaw is incredible too.Other fare is quite nice and tasty as well.  The "Dragon Wings" are wonderful and a nice snack to go along with all the various beers on tap.It's dark, sometimes loud. I like to go on an off night when I need a more subdued atmosphere.  This is NOT a corporate type bar & restaurant.  Once you know and understand that, you will be very happy.  No pretentious attitudes abide.The only reason I do not give the G&D 5 stars is that the service can be a little inconsistent, but goes with the territory.All in all it's a great place with terrific food and drink.  Just the way intended for a REAL pub.Valerie is a great BTW and one of the most consistent staff.
4	I had a restaurant.com coupon so I got to try a bunch of stuff (but I guess they don't take these anymore, our waitress had to check with the manager to let us use ours).  Seems like a happening, dive-bar type environment.  They were finishing up a poker tournament which it seems like there's one like every day.  Not sure why they left all the tvs on a channel with a cleft-palate infomercial for a charity pretty much all night, it was kind of a downer...The pasties were phenominal.  A definitely must-try, and will get every time I go there.  The wings were so-so, we ordered medium which were pretty hot, but there wasn't much to the sauce but Red-hot it seemed.  The fish and chips were good, which some places mess up with the batter being undercooked but they seemed to do a pretty good job.  The shepherd's pie was ok, though isn't it supposed to have a crust at the bottom?  Wasn't sure.All-in-all, a good place to start off a night or hang out for a game.  Would not go for more than a happy hr type venture.
4	The BF took me here last night, as it used to be a hang out for him when he was younger. It was a pretty fun time. The place is not real 'hip' I would say, but everyone seemed to be having fun. They had tvs playing the basketball game and the place was pretty busy at around 8:30 when we went there. We ordered a couple beers (I got a Hef and he got a black velvet I think.... cider and Guinness) and we ordered a shepherd's pie and some fries. The beers were good and the food was really tasty. It was exactly what I wanted but didn't know I wanted. The shepherd's pie is really mashed potato -y and the meat is really tasty.... very flavorful. The pie is huge too so I wouldn't think twice about sharing it. After that he got a jameson and ginger ale and I got a couple shots- a buttery nipple (the best shot) and an orgasm shot (ok... not as good as the other). The BF's drink was huge... like a pint of whiskey. Anyway, the night was good, I like the atmosphere (they also have pool and darts and all kinds of stuff to do) and the drinks were nice too, our total was around 50$ after tip so not too bad for the amount of stuff we got. I would definitely go back in the future.
5	This is a very good English Pub, Restaurant.                                                  The food is extremely authentic. Chicken Pie is my fav, although it might also be the Fish and Chips!  Great British Tea,and i love the fact that a portrait of the Queen is in the main dining room.                                        The decor is very British. I am not a Drinker however, everyone says there (patrons) the beer is fantastic.  Servers are nice, Manager Keith is fabulous. He is always there to answer questions! Lots of fun!
2	I like to focus on the positive so let's start there. The hot wings. Get em spicy hot. They were really good. Worth going here for? NoIt's a dark bar, my date liked the English vibe of it.The waitresses were slow (but pleasant) with bringing the drinks and once we did get them the drinks sucked. I ordered a Irish Car Bomb and got less than half a glass of warm Guiness, with the tiniest shot of baileys/whiskey. It was almost undrinkable. Then I ordered the $2.50 drink shot special which tasted like a shot of kool-aid.We went for the Monday karaoke, and the DJ was good enough but there was this little tv in the corner with the lyrics displayed. I've just been to better karaoke bars (i.e. Ernies)Like I said my date liked this place, so I guess YMMV. I think I would have liked it more if the service was better and the drinks were up to par.
4	Today I finally made it to George & Dragon.  I was in a pinch and looking for a place that had Telefutera so I could watch my favorite soccer team (Chicago Fire) play.  I called George & Dragon and was told they could accommodate.  One packed light rail ride later I was there and ready to get my game and drink on.George & Dragon is my type of place.  The decor has been described by other Yelpers as very British.  Since I have not been the the UK, I cannot attest to that but it does look like what I think a British pub should look like.  It actually reminded me of the Winchester in Shaun of the Dead.  The football scarves are always a nice touch.  Perhaps one day I'll donate a USA or Fire scarf and see if they put it up among the UK clubs scarves.The beer selection was not as good as I had hoped it would be but it's still better than most. Today I was in the mood to drink German despite being in a British pub so I opted to drink Spaten.  For lunch I ordered the Shepherds Pie and it was amazing.  It's the third different shepherds pie I've had in metro Phoenix and it might be the best one.My team lost an ugly one and it spoiled my day a bit but I was happy to have made my first visit to George & Dragon.  It will not be my last.  With easy access to light rail I plan on being back soon.  Cheers!
4	I love this pub! I'm a soccer fanatic, and this bar is DECKED out with scarves of most any club you can think of, and there is always soccer on the telly. Robby and Keith (owner and manager?) are a riot, and always greet you warmly when you arrive! The food is traditional English pub fare: the fish and chips and the bangers and mash are HIGHLY recommended! I hear the wings are pretty good, so I'll prob try them nixt visit! And if you need a good laugh stop by on a Monday night for karaoke, its a blast!
4	I've been wanting to check this place out for years, and finally got to hit them up on a Saturday night.Overall I was quite happy, decent beer selection, and the table arrangement worked well with our medium sized group.  The bar staff was busy, but friendly. Sadly, they were out of a couple of the beers I really wanted to try.The patio area is nice, with plenty of room and tables.  The single toilet for the ladies was a bit of a drag.Overall there was a great atmosphere.  Didn't try the food, but would go back to check that out.  Best part is that they are so close to the lightrail, because I'd never drive that far to have a drink or 3.
2	went here a second time with my regular date "D" on a Friday night. He likes that place for some reason. I needed a drink. The female bartender gave me the beer menu and I looked at it like it was a foreign object. "D" said "oh no she won't drink beer, she'll have some kind of mixed drink". So the bartender made me some sweet concoction. It tasted like weak kool-aid. I ordered 2 more different drinks, even the shot of Raspberry Stoli was weak. I asked her to make me a "British Invasion" cocktail and that was faintly good but definitely WEAK. "D": said even his beer wasn't good. I feel like all their drinks are super watered down. the drinks at George and Dragon are a BIG dissapointment, make a note of it. However we also ordered food, cause I was starving. Now THAT was good. We got the Cornish Pasty with mashed potatoes and green peas and also chicken fingers with honey mustard sauce. The cornish pasty was DELICIOUS beyond Delicious.  Lots of people were in there and seemed to be enjoying themselves. I just don't see the appeal of the place. Part of my family is from England but maybe I'm just not British enough to appreciate this place.I'll probably go back for the Cornish Pasty and also cause men actually FLIRTED with me there, and that NEVER happens to me in person. I like being flirted with and whistled at.
1	There has been so much anticipation to go to G&D for Karaokee on mondays.  After a great bbq we all decided to go and sing our hearts out...well we arrived at about 10pm...added our names to the list...cheered othered singers on to encourage a good time, spent some money and tipped well....and waited patiently....well after 2.5 hours have gone by we had seen the same three girls go up the several times before we have...we get it...if they got there before us and signed up, its their turn...but then the host started singing songs and kept picking "random" chicks to sings songs...ok...now its getting weird.  Then when we saw the person that signed up right before us go up and then one of the same "three" girls and then the host "randomly" pick again.....we got pissed of and were ready to leave.  We were pissed and cashed out.  Then when we told the karaokee host that he was an ass and that we had been waiting over 2 hrs and were pissed, he pretty much talked crap and walked away.  Then he had the nerve to call our names when we walked right out of the door.  We came back in and talked to management.  We were there to have a good time and spend money.  I would rather spend my money elsewhere.  Star karaokee sux, IDK what the hell Michael the Karaokee host from star karaokee's problem was, but he was completely unprofessional and just plain RUDE.  We get it, you have your regulars, but we are cusotmers too.....we would have brought more people back in the future...but you can have fun with the same three people for your pitiful karaokee night.
4	Now I'm writing this in my British accent. Bloody good Mate! Okay that's all I got. I dig this place, the food is good & they serve it up in big portions. It's a pub, so fights & blood on the floor is expected. Come on AMber, get out of Scottsdale much?Anyways, I recommend this place. It's a cool place to get out of the heat, good oral hygiene is not required. =)
3	I like going to George & Dragon for a beer because I know that, for the most part, G&D is dependable. You can always expect a crowd of people, you can always depend on the beer, and you know that there is good pub food. However, other than being dependable, it isn't too much more than that. I really wish the service was a little better - the waitstaff and bartenders always seem a bit grumpy to me, as if they'd like nothing more than to have nothing to do with me.
4	Slay the Dragon! You can request a drink card with every type of beer available and if you try one of each, you get a free shirt, LOL! Me? I stuck to Guinness by the pint and had the Cornish pasty and sausage roll - both delectable but kind of small for the $6 price tag. It's a pub in every essence of the word - they have free darts (that's right, FREE!), a juke box filled with classic rock hits at 25 cents to a dollar per song, and 50 cent billiards! They also host World Series Poker tourneys! The service is super sweet (although they get REALLY busy sometimes) but the joint is really laid back and friendly!
4	I don't know if this is as good as it gets because I have never been to England, but I really like the food.   I took my Dad here for Father's Day lunch and really enjoyed our meal.  The iced tea was fresh and my cornish pastie was really delicious.  I wish I had one now.  My Dad's steak and mushroom pie looked really good too.  Also, the prices were decent.
1	Last night was my first visit to George and Dragon....and unfortunately, it will probably be my last.  My boyfriend, my daughter and I decided to go there for FATHER'S DAY.  We walked in the front door and stood in the middle of the room facing the bar.  There were maybe 6 or 7 occupied tables--it wasn't busy.  So we stood there, unsure of wether we sat ourselves or waited to be seated.  3 servers were present as well as a blonde bartender who totally ignored us.  Finally we asked if we sat ourselves and the bartender said to go right ahead.  We picked a booth facing the bar and sat.  And sat........and sat......and sat.  One male bartender seemed to be working in a back room only.  Another girl stood alongside the bar, staring out @ us, drinking a soda as we sat there with no menus.  The bartender, who was maybe 15 feet from us, would look @ us sideways, and look away.  My boyfriend works for the City of Phoenix.  He's a HUGE tipper.  Maybe we don't look like much, but...??????? We waited 12 minutes (I am a server/bartender myself, so I watch greet times closely).  Finally we stood up and walked out...walked RIGHT past the bartender and she never said a word!!!!!!!!!!  I did call a spoke to a managernamed Bill, who sounded shocked.  I hope he took care of the problem or they will lose a LOT of business =(  We ended up having a very nice Father's Day dinner @ The Black Forest Mill...thumbs up to them!
3	I've been frequenting the George and Dragon for a little while when I pass thru Central Phoenix. The food is excellent, especially the cornish pasties. I enjoy the atmosphere, darts, and booze but I got to say that the service is hit and miss. There are 2 servers that are polite and most the rest aren't happy to be there. Sometimes there attitude goes hand in hand with the quality of service. I will continue to eat and drink there though the service is hit and miss.
3	This place is a really cool space and has such a great vibe to it.  This would be a cool place to come and chill with friend and drink beer and watch sports.  I would have to say that this review is probably more of a 3.5 stars.I am not overly crazy about the food.  But hey, what do you expect from bar food and English cuisine.  I know my bf, who is from across the pond, loves the food as it takes him back to his memories of England.  The service is good and the people are always friendly!  The Blackberry and Apple crumble is the best!  Be sure to save room for that dessert!
4	Great English pub in the middle of Phoenix.  The fish and chips meal is delicious.  Also, they serve great Black and Tans.  Sometimes the service can be a bit slow, but overall, I recommend George and Dragon.
2	I've been here a few times now and service has never been great but never bad until tonight.I step up to the bar and order a Guiness and was told their systems are down so it will be a few. Fine. I get my Guiness and listen to obnoxious people do a karaoke version of Cult of Personality and read the news on my phone. Time for beer number two and the systems are still down. No worries, I'm paying cash this whole time anyways. I give the lady my money and wait for my beer. A couple minutes go by, she pours drinks and explains to people that her systems are down. She's really befuddled as if she's never experienced life without a computer. Others walk up and order drinks and receive their beers promptly while mine hasn't been poured yet. After about 10 minutes I just say screw it and leave. I'm sure dealing with down systems is stressful but if I'm paying cash it should be a non-issue. Knowing that the others came up to the bar after me and were at the time running a card tab makes it even more confusing.This night aside, food is generally decent. The place lacks a pinball machine. Owner seems like a nice enough guy in the past.Note to someone: not having a computer is no reason for poor customer service. Also, perhaps having someone pitch in behind the bar would be a good idea so that the easily flustered bartender doesn't get so stressed out next time.I hope somone got to enjoy my beer or that the extra $4.25 went to buy some sort of stress relief for the bartender because that $4.25 didn't do a damn thing for me.
5	Okay... the bad reviewers must have gone to another bar or something. If you are looking for table clothes or elegant atmosphere, why go to a bar? I have had great luck here. This place is everything that I would expect an English pub to be. They have many beers (an amazing amount) and when I went there, I had a waitress remember me and my drink order from about 3 weeks prior. Make no mistake, this is a PUB! It is not fine dining! It is a local bar where you can let your hair down and relax! The atmosphere is great and the girls are pretty, both customers and wait staff! The food is great pub food! What more could anyone want from a bar? I haven't been disappointed yet, and I have been going there for at least 2 years. It isn't perfect... it's a bar. I'm looking to sit with my friends, have great conversation, drink a beer, eat good food, and look at girls. Isn't that what a bar is for? If that is what you are interested in, George and Dragon is the perfect place!
5	Great place for traditional English Pub Food. They put on lots of fun events to celebrate various British holidays, friendly atmosphere. Always feel welcome!
4	Like many born and raised new englanders, from time to time I get the craving for *quality* British pub food, and in Arizona this can be a disappointment in the making... Until you try George and Dragon.The fish and chips is hands down the BEST I've ever had. Scotch eggs are always good, again if you have a palate for this type of fare. They are served with a tangy fruit chutney, and everything is complimented by their exceptional list of beers on *fresh* tap. Late nights can get a little loud and rowdy but otherwise its a fun and relatively clean establishment. Cant wait to go again!
1	From the other descriptions I am reading, I believe our party had the same blond bartender.  Granted she didn't curse out anyone in our party, but it wasn't a very pleasant experience.  It's like she can't be bothered and perform her job in pleasant manner.  Why employ anyone like that?  Last time I checked, restaurants were in the SERVICE industry, so provide better service or customers won't come back.
5	Came in from Vegas! Love this place. Trivia was a blast on Thursday and Friday is even better. Greatest staff ever.
1	This was our second venture to this joint: the first time was a disaster as we didn't even get noticed once so no food or drink was to be had. The staff gets perfect marks for ignoring us, This time the joint wasn't to busy so figured we would have a decent chance at getting service. Well we sort of got service from a staff member who seemed annoyed we bothered her to order. The drinks were slow to come out and for beer it wasn't very cold. Before we could ask for waters our server ran away. We did finally order "food" the curry wings looked like a pile of gooey vomit and didn't taste much better. There were three of us at the table, each regretfully had one wing and shoved the rest to the side. I ordered the Halo burger which had a crisp cheddar ring around it which was the best part. The burger itself was something straight from the freezer, pre-made greasy as all can be. No flavor and the condiments that came with the burger were the standard fare. The steak fries as a side should have stayed in the kitchen. They were underdone and soggy. No flavor either. My wife ordered the french dip, something that usually you can't screw up. Well these guys at G&D are batting 1000 with subpar food, I've tasted better french dips at hospital cafeterias. Our friend ordered the Reuben grinder, he said it was OK, but again the fries stayed on the plate. Our wait staff was non existent. She never bothered to check on us once. We had to stand up to show that we were ready for our check...that really didn't work so our friend had to track her down. Plan to ask for your check well ahead of time as they do not value your time. I guess we are the idiots for trying the place again but really you might get em on a bad day so give them the benefit of the doubt and try em again. Well twice was WAY more than I will be spending there. I know they have a lot of regulars and maybe these folks are fine with the usual horrible AZ customer service and crappy food. I for one, coming from Chandler, like to enjoy a decent meal. We didn't order anything complex yet this joint managed to make even a simple burger just plain bad.
5	If you want GREAT food and service, please try the George and Dragon.  I've been coming here for ten years, and absolutely love it.  The owner is very accommodating to our huge soccer after-parties!  The wait-staff is fun and friendly.  There is a wide array of beer selection available.    This pub hosts a great World Cup party! Keep up the great work!!
4	Been going to G&D ever since moving here to Phoenix a little over 3yrs ago.  My first experience at the place was a few weeks after moving.  It was the middle of August and the AC and all refrigeration at the place had gone out.  Despite the rising heat in the place the bartenders were still moving quickly behind the bar and trying to make the most of the situation for the customers.  They let people know the situation and were knocking down prices as beers started to get a lil warm before things got fixed later on in the early evenning.  I noticed that lots of people still stuck around even with it getting pretty warm inside.  That to me meant on a regular day this was a good spot.Ever since that first time and thinking there was a reason people stuck around, my thoughts have been proved right each time I go.  I have never had a bad time when I go into G&D.  The food is great, especially with the newer menu and cooking staff.  I have yet to have a bad item when I order food.  Most recently had the Turkey Club and it was a huge sandwich and very good.  The wings are always great and the potato soup on Thursdays is a good eat during Trivia.  Yeah, I said it, soup in AZ.Staff has always been great.  Like the servers at any and all restaurants, there are good servers and ok servers.  At G&D it is no different but here the OK servers are better than most you will find at other small pubs and bars.  When it gets overly busy orders can run slow but that should be expected during a huge rush.  Over all I have found that the staff is great and if you go there to enjoy yourself and treat them well, they return the favor.  I have been going to the G&D long enough that I have gotten to know most of the staff and have not had a bad experience with any of them.I am a big fan of this place and try to make it there once a weekend.  I rarely miss a Trivia night on Thursdays.  Highly recommend hitting up the G&D, one of the better spots I have found here in Phoenix.
1	The drinks are so weak here that I had to order a vodka shot to put in my vodka martini and a whiskey shot to put in my whiskey sour. It tasted like water before. Any liquor drinks taste like watered down juice. And they aren't cheap drinks, so that's ridiculous. The food is good though.
4	Cheap drinks! and it wasn't even happy hour! SCORE! Seriously. I thought this place was a Chinese food place due to the name. I had no idea it was actually a Pub. My mistake. I was here this past Saturday celebrating a friends birthday and we enjoyed ourselves. Between people watching and just talking about everything (and I do mean everything) plus the drinks were cheap. What more can a girl ask for? I will definitely be back here again!
4	I like this place.I'm comfortable here.I don't drink and don't watch sports so unfortunately there's not much of a reason for me to go,but the few times I've been with friends have been very enjoyable.I did play trivia one night and cheated off some other player's smartphone.I like the fact that real people go and are just plain social.Haven't tried the food yet.Oh,I stopped in last night for a bit with a friend and we had the blonde server who was genuinely nice to us.I wish I had better recall,but I think she said her name was Valerie when she came to the table as we arrived.On the few occasions I've been here,have always been treated well even though all I'm drinking is Pepsi...Some bars look down on that as they consider it "deadheading" and taking up space...They make their money on alcohol,so they make nothing on me...Treated very well here every time none the less.
4	I've been popping into the George and Dragon nearly every Thursday since last April for trivia nights.  I like the place.  The trivia host is entertaining and the place feels worn in, but not worn down.  I feel comfortable and welcome every time I visit.  Most weeks I end up ordering a couple beers from the rather large selection.  The drink prices, while high for some people's tastes, are comparable to what I've seen in other places.  Imports are going to cost more, it's the price you pay to have a selection of Boddington's, Murphy's and Guinness all in one place, among other things.Normally on trivia nights I don't end up getting food, as although I find their portions proportional to the prices, I don't feel I need to eat half my weight in fish and chips in one sitting.  I have no qualms with the quality on the few occasions I've grabbed some eats, for example the curry chicken is very flavorful and highly recommended.  The dragon wings are another of my favorite, spicy but not overwhelming.  The fish and chips, as previously mentioned, are served on a giant platter and have generally been excellent.I recommend at least one visit to this bar.  Don't be scared off by the divey look of the pub-front.  The F.C. scarves adorning the ceiling, British booze advertisements on the walls, and the cozy but not claustrophobic seating arrangements make it a unique place in the middle of the desert.  If you do visit, pop in on a trivia night so you can listen to the host demean the guests with some clever snide remarks and give yourself an entertaining diversion for a night.  Who knows, you may become a regular before you know it.
4	good food d prices but not to hefty om the portions
4	This is a very differant place. It has been here for about 20 years, maybe more. They have a good menu for food. A bit high priced, but very authentic. So my girlfriend says and she grew up on British food.Their fish and chips are really good, Chicken Pie and a good drink selection as well.Lots of parkiing in the lot. Big dining area and lots going on like pool, darts, and other games on different nights. Nice patio, but smoking is allowed there. good for smokers ,not good for me.Their is a strange smell inside, that i can't quite place, not bad just strange.  I like it though. Food is good!
5	Four of us ate here for the first time and were all very impressed. I have high standards for food and service but this exceeded them. SERVICE: First and foremost the service was OUTSTANDING! I wish I would had noted the girls name but her description of the menu was fabulous. Made our mouth water for everything. The food was just what she described. She always was there at the right time and anticipated our next need.FOOD: It came out piping hot (which is a must for me). The unique combinations of flavors were prepared and presented perfectly. We had fish and chips, fish tacos, and meatloaf (the best ever). All home made and outstanding! The beer was amazing and I can't forget to mention the bread pudding was also the best I have ever had!We will definitely be making this place a regular stop.
4	The wait staff was a little crabby but besides that I had an awesome first time experience there.
3	We were here twice. Every place (even with Guinness) can't be a 5 star place so some of the draw backs are it smells kind of funky and the parking lot really needs lines. Both times I think the tap needs to be replaced because the stout was not as thick and creamy as usual. But the pubs in the UK did spoil me. The portions were a little small. We had to order seconds to feel full. Make sure you try the HP sauce on whatever you order. This is a thick, tangy steak sauce that makes every flavor soar. It does smell a little bar-like inside.
5	This place is great. We've taken friends, out of towners, and family here. We went here the night of my bachelorette party. The food is good. I've had the hummus.. mmm I forgot what other food I had here. The service is great, there are pool tables and darts. The bathrooms are horrible, but you really go in expecting that. The big comfy booths are key. The outdoor area is really nice at night under the misters. We had one lame waitress once. She did a good enough job but had the sense of humor of a wet mop. This place is always a good time.
4	I have been coming to G&D for a while now. I was introduced to the friendly, British bar, by a good friend of mine who was determined to slay the dragon (which she finally did after 2 or 3 years.) I have to be honest, I have never had a meal at this place, but I have had plenty to drink. Just the other day, my running club met up for drinks after our long run, and it just so happened to be trivia night! If it wasn't for work the next day, we would have stayed the entire night and finished up the game. A couple of my friends did end up ordering dinner from the menu. I have to say that the fish looked delish! The only downfall to this place is that it does get a little loud during the busy nights and the sound system can be a little better for those who are trying to listen to the trivia questions (on Thursday). Overall, this is a very friendly, neighborhood bar and I am definitely not about to cut this one from the list.
4	Good service, food and prices but a god awful sewer smell permeated the entire place!
5	My head is still throbbing in protest after the 1st EVER George and Dragon Toga Pub Crawl:Just imagine  a bunch of drunkards in togas on the light rail terrorizing local bars such as The Old Spaghetti Factory;  Cheuvront (they LOVED us); Carly's Bistro; The Lost Leaf; reBar; Lucky Strike; Copper Blues; Seamus's and then back to George and Dragon where the fun all started.A FANTASTIC bloody good time. A shout out to the roller derby girls who were doing their own pub crawl...sorry we had to part ways.Too much good fun.......can't wait for the next one!!!!!
3	The best place in town to watch European football (soccer for locals). I would rate it with 5 stars but the food is just tasteless, so think about watching football and having drinks there only.
4	George & Dragon is definitely a cool place to hang out, have a drink and watch sports with your friends.  A few of us went here a couple weeks ago before an evening event.  We grabbed one of the large half circle booths near the windows.  A waitress came over, took our drink orders and told us about what was good. Now Ive heard the Fish & Chips was the best in town.  So after looking at the menu, my girlfriend and I both got that.Im a huge fish & chips fan...  So I will try any and all of them. Plus being Friday, they are usually all-you-can-eat.  Our meals came out and I was ready to dig in.  It smelled delicious.  When I took a bite, I noticed that it was crunchier than i usually like.  Almost too crunchy. I asked for a couple sides of sauce to dip it in.  Seems I used up both sides pretty quickly.  Ok, the fish was good.. but it didnt blow my mind and it wasnt the best.  So far my favorite Fish & Chips is Fox & Hound over on Bell Rd & 83rd.Still G&D is a great place! .. I will order something different next time.
4	I feel lik eI say this in all of my ratings, but I really do love this place! They have great comfort food, fresh vegetables (which are hard tom find even in upscale places) and it's got the classic pub feel, not the American "pub" feel, if you know what I mean. The only down side is that the wait staff/bartenders are hit or miss, the ones that are a hit are fantastic and genuinely friendly, but the ones that are a miss are LAME! Terrific place for groups also.
3	Atmosphere is very English. Food was pricey, but quite authentic. Tried the scotch egg, it was different, but good with the chutney!  Had the lamb roast, seemed a little bland, and the peas were frozen. Overall, an average meal, with cool atmosphere!
3	The fish and chips tasted very good. The problem was that the bar was on the grimey side and the food was not fresh. The corn that came as a side was definitely not fresh I would be willing to wager was frozen. The staff was polite but hard at work trying to obtain good tips from regulars and everyone else was 2nd class. I would return, but they have some shaping up to do. STOP using frozen food.
3	Good Food! PLEASE get some new Tv's Not a good place for NFL Sundays!
4	Every time we've been people have been friendly.  There's a camaraderie.  A Cheers-esque feeling if you will. Important in any neighborhood bar.  I've sampled the fish and chips and Shepard's pie and have not been disappointed.  Service has been good, quick and efficient.
4	Ive never had the food here, just drinks.This is probably one of the most authentic British Pubs in the valley, proof by the Brit owner cracking jokes on the mic behind the bar.They have a great tap and bottle selection, and their mixed drinks are pretty good as well. Very friendly staff, kind of slow sometimes, but very accommodating. The decor is nice, just kitchy enough. The pool tables are cheap, and I believe they have darts as well.A great place to start or finish your night in Central Phoenix.
4	Always fun to hit up the George & Dragon Pub when visiting Phoenix.  The food wont blow you away, its standard pub fair, but the atmosphere is great.  Plenty of TV's to cover any game thats on, whether that be British Football or any American Sports.  Darts, Pool Table, and when they have Karaoke, seems like a few pros show up and put on quite a show.  If you are looking for a bar atmosphere that is a lot of fun, this place is worth a visit.
3	G&D is an authentic, dark British pub with friendly staff and cold drinks. I like the dart boards and pool tables. The patio looking onto Central would be cool if it wasn't always filled with smokers. Don't bother dressing up or expecting to see pretty people here. You go to drink! G&D was my best guess for a friend who wanted to watch early-morning Chelsea games as he does at pubs in San Diego, but I don't believe they open early for that.
4	Love coming here for team trivia night on Thursdays.  They have Guinness on tap, which makes this girl very happy, and decent irish food.  We love the team trivia guy.
4	When I want to get my English on, this is the first place I think of!!! The owner of this pub is the funniest, sweetest bar owner I have ever met! Each time my girlfriends and I go here he is always greeting us and sits down and chats! My favorite night is trivia nights on Thursday evenings. It's always fun to test you and your friend's random knowledge. The best part is, everyone in the bar participates and everyone gets into it. Not only can you enjoy great food, delicious beers and fun people, the winners of trivia get free food and drinks! How does this not sound like a great place to visit?! Just an FYI this place gets crazy around soccer, I mean football season!!! Fun place to check out!
5	Really authentic british fare. The ambiance is true to the food. The staff is absolutely friendly and knowledgeable on the menu.  They've been here 18 years  - that says a lot.The appetizers are fabulous; the wings are my favorite!  They come out hot, they're spiced nicely, they're HUGE compared to most wings and you can order them crispy..and they come out crispy!The prices are very fair. It's just a fun, solid place that is very comfortable and you are guaranteed a good meal.  Good parking, and there's a rail stop within 1 block.  I totally recommend this place!
3	I go to the G&D about once a year. Everytime the food is very average and the staff is indifferent. The wife and I went there a couple weeks ago, a buddy of mine Peter was doing a 24 hour piano marathon, pretty sure it was for St Joe's hospital. The corn beef and cabbage was flavorless deli corn beef. (no seasoning...) The wife had seasonless fish and chips. Better hiring and training will fix all this. So why the 3 stars after all this? Great live music and a well poured Guinness is worth something. ;)
4	Love this Pub! The Shepherds Pie and bread pudding is AWESOME! Plenty of beer on tap and available. This place has that home town around the corner feel. My only complaint with this bar is that if you are female the waitresses tend to take their time serving you! Otherwise I dig the joint!
2	Our annual Brides of March pub crawl patronized this establishment this past Saturday and I have to say, our experience was not exactly stellar.  I get that there were a lot of us.  I realize it must be a tall order to serve 100ish tipsy brides.  BUT, as I understand it, bars and restaurants were notified beforehand that we were coming.  And that is why there is no excuse for having to wait ONE HOUR for an appetizer platter.  An HOUR.  For fried things.  And to add insult to injury, people to our right and left were eating well before we were and they sat down after we did.  The icing on the cake was that we asked the waitress to substitute something else for the zucchini sticks and can you guess what happened?  We got zucchini sticks.  The food is fine - it's bowling alley food and I'm okay with that.  But the service was inexcusable.
4	I received a very nice email from the manager addressing our unsatisfactory experience.  I always appreciate when managers/owners care enough to reach out to an unhappy customer.  I will definitely give G&D another shot.
2	The atmosphere was pretty good for a pub, but the food was "meh."  For an English pub the fish and chips were average at best. The service was very poor because they were too busy and had little staff. The waitress was overwhelmed, but was courteous and pleasant. Even though she was nice, we did not have our drinks refilled and were forgotten about for long periods of time.  The manager was very unaware of things that had to get done it seemed as he was busy moving tables, but not helping the wait staff fill drinks and assist with customers.
4	Enjoyed the fish and chips. The fish flaky, thick cut, with a thin crispy batter. The chips... a little to soft. Overall pretty good. Looks like a great place to catch a soccer game. English style food.
5	I had the best meatloaf here, that I have ever had in my entire live. It is layered with awesomely goodness. I like that it is a dark, out of the way spot. I will definitely head over there again.
4	Stopped in here on a whim and was pleasantly suprised!  This is a great bar with great food.....try the scottish egg!  The bartender sat and told me about other sites in thePhoenix area that I should go check out!  Very friendly place.  I will be returning !
3	Food was ok - atmosphere is fine.  I was not overly impressed on my two visits but nothing was really wrong with it either.
5	Quite good, possibly the best fish and chips I've had in the States.
3	I have been here a couple times and generally enjoy it. The parking is not the best and it's a dark lit area. They have decent beer selection, the food is hit or miss. I have had the fish & chips 2 times and it was good but the coleslaw that came with it was horrible. The other times I had just a pub burger and it was nothing special. I've been able to catch a few of the bagpipe acts here and it's cool to see. They have darts and a pool table. Overall it's a cool place to come have a drink.
4	I've been coming here every Thursday with friends for Trivia Night for probably a year and a half now. Even though I'm a regular, I've only had the food here a handful of times, so I can't really offer too much insight in that aspect. However, I can tell you that the experience you get at G&D is superb. From the time I first started coming up until now, I've had several different waitresses--all of whom are super friendly and provide great service. Our current waitress, Ashley, have already memorized our regular drink orders. I always get a hot tea with lots of extra lemons and some extra napkins, and she never fails to get all of that to me as soon as we are seated. Trivia nights are amazingly fun. Even though we're a group of young girls competing against 40 or 50-year old men who knows every obscure fact on the face of this planet, it's still great to test your knowledge and learn some random new information you might not have known before. For example, I now have it ingrained in my brain that "Nights in White Satin" is by The Moody Blues (as they've asked that question more than a couple times in past trivia nights...).David, the owner of G&D is a great guy who's very personable. He comes around to each table and chats with different groups, and sometimes offers hints to questions if he doesn't consider you to be a "wanker" (a term he often uses to call out the really obnoxious customers). He also tells a couple of dirty or "offensive" jokes every Thursday, all in good fun!One more thing...the bathroom toilet seat covers have the British flag on them! It's pretty cool. Also I heard that the women's bathroom in the back is haunted, but the scariest thing I've ever seen in there so far was only a cockroach, so I'm not sure how accurate that rumor is.I love G&D because it's not at all pretentious. It's just a comfortable place where you can come hang out, relax, enjoy a few drinks with friends, chat and play games. It's got its little quirks, but that's what I love about it, and when I walk in I feel completely at home. :)
4	Absolutely fun place to hang out. Good beer. Good food...except avoid the coleslaw. They had live music when we were there. I've never been to England or Europe but I'd imagine this is what it's like. Fun people fun atmosphere fun times.
5	Went in for a quick beer but decided to have lunch too. Had the fish and chips and was surprised on the two large pieces of fish I received.the fish was hot and fresh, the chips were nice and hot too. The wife had steak and kidney pie which she said was perfect . They have a great selection of beer and liquor . Would absolutely go back again next time we see a Dbacks game.
3	We stepped into this restaurant and it looked like what I'd imagine an British pub would be. The menu offers several different beer, wine, and liquor options, from several different regions of the world. Food options are a mix of American, Irish, and British pub type foods.We started with the medium hot wing drumettes as an appetizer. They were the right amount of heat level- not too hot, not too mild. The sauce itself was very vinegary and the meat tasted a little on the dry side.As for entrees, I decided on the fish and chips, and tried some of the shepherd's pie. The fish and chips came as 2 sizable pieces of battered fillets, with a heap of fries. Although I ordered it with peas, it came with an extra side of coleslaw. The batter was excellent on the fish: A beautiful golden brown, and very crisp. The fish though, tasted dry. The coleslaw was crisp, but had no flavor. Service was somewhat lackluster. Although our server would take away plates, he did not bother to check on our table to refill drinks (Sodas). Even when asked if we could get a refill he forgot to go to our table until we were done with our meal, and by that time it didn't matter to us if we had refills. In addition, it took a long time to get our check.I wasn't too impressed with the fish and chips, but I did like the shepherd's pie better. The mashed potatoes, ground meat, and veggies meshed well together with the gravy. While I wasn't very impressed with the fish and chips, I'd like to give George and Dragon another shot. Maybe another item on the menu will be better on the palate!
4	Basically a no frills pub.  It's been here forever and they're unapologetically unpretentious.  If you're looking for fine dining or exquisite presentation you're in the wrong place.  But if you want some decent pub grub, a pool table, or a great place to watch some soccer, then this is a good spot.  Location is right on the light rail line on Central Ave.  During happy hour you'll see everything from corporate suits to motorcyclists to neighborhood locals.  And yes, the fish and chips are on point.
4	Great drink prices, good food, fun atmosphere, and friendly staff. We've been coming here for Thursday trivia for a few months now. It's a great place to get together with friends! The crowd is a nice mix and it's definitely not a pretentious place.
4	George & Dragon! After driving by you for months, I finally decided to stop in. Very nice!Well, pretty nice. Maybe just nice. The four star rating is very weak, but I decided to bump up from 3 to 4 because we had a good time. I like that this place is low key and not pretentious. I like that on Sundays, they play different football games rather than just focusing on the Cardinals. And I like that they host different things, like live music and trivia nights.The food is very bland. However, it's a bar, so expecting the meal of your life is a little silly. It isn't greasy, bad bar food; it's average and a little overpriced. I would stick to a simple appetizer and some drinks in the future.Fish and chips were OK - the corn was definitely frozen, and I think the fish may have been as well. Burger was very simple and bland. I did like the thick cut fries, but they were probably frozen as well. Portions were pretty good, which is a plus.The service was OK. A little lackluster - our server seemed a bit frazzled, and she was the only one working the dining room. There were several tables that hadn't been cleared of the dirty dishes after the customers had left, so seating was limited based on that. The restaurant isn't dirty, but it isn't immaculate, either.I can definitely see why people wouldn't like this place, but for me, it's close to home, and it's a good place to relax without being around a huge crowd. If you stop in, don't expect too much, and you'll (hopefully) be pleasantly surprised like my husband and I were.
3	We definitely want to give this place a try again.  We made our way to this location on a Thursday night around 8 p.m. and the main portion was pretty decently packed, so we sat off to the right side, which seemed more open.  Next time I would like to sit int he main part where all the noise and decor is really happening.  I had the Cornish Pastie - "puff pastry stuffed with ground beef, vegetables, served with mashed potatoes, peas and gravy."  And he had the Shepherd's Pie - "marinated lean ground beef, mashed potatoes, sharp cheddar and gravy upon request."  Both were delicious!  The food was definitely the hard core return factor for us.The staff seemed friendly enough and our waitress took care of everything in an efficient manner - she had a group that went from about 8 people to roughly 20 people in the corner booth over the ~45 min. we were there so she got a tad tied up towards the end with accommodating their orders.  Overall: B+Sit in the main part of the restaurant - be ready for a bit of loud music / noise.  Enjoy the decor and eat some good pub food.
3	I went here on a Friday night for dinner.  It was kinda busy but not so much that it was too loud and oppressive.  We ordered the cornish pasty and the fish and chips for dinner.  The cornish pasty was by far my favorite dish.  If I had only that for dinner I would have given 4 stars.  The fish and chips though were too thickly breaded.  It really over powered the fish, and wasn't even cooked long enough to make the breading crisp.  It was just too heavy.  I wish the breading was thinner and crisper.  This is why I rated only a three.  It makes me wonder about the rest of the dishes.  Maybe I'll get another chance to eat here again.
3	Good food. Staff is really nice. Erica she was a little snotty but over all a good place to be. Good vibes for the most part. They have karaoke and pool too. Cool place.
5	Great food every time, lots of lovely staff, a bit rough around the edges but if you want someone to wipe your mouth after each bite, don't go to an English pub. Decor is warm and cozy, almost that if it's in the middle of London. Tons of seating, booths, tables, and bar seating available. They've even got a pool table for those with short attention spans while drinking. :) The best thing about this place is, according to the Boyfriend, you can chat with locals or chill in a corner and enjoy the environment and not be bothered. Poker night on Wednesdays draws a bunch of old timer locals. Trivia night on Thursdays is apparently bustin at the seams, I'll be back to check that out too. Drinks are rockin, food is excellent every time. What more could you ask for? It feels like home. Home sweet pub.
5	Tonight is Friday which means its all you can eat fish and chips. I tell you what, they did not disappoint.  As Arizona is not a sea faring state, they of course use previously frozen fish that they make their own batter for. Now, don't get turned off by the fish being from where it is,  you can barely tell. The fish was flaky and juicy and the batter was crisp and flavorful. The chips were soft on the inside and crisp on the outside so they were obviously cooked at the perfect temperature.  Service was of the top, and attention wasn't lacking. I would highly recommend that you spend some time at our local English pub, it won't disappoint.
4	I've been here a handful of times over the years for dinner.  Had no clue they had a weekend brunch menu.  I think I was the only one that  ordered off the regular menu in our group.  Based on comments no one went away unhappy with their choices.  Our waitress had never worked opening shift before but did a great job.  The place is getting a little worn but it fits.  I am sure I'll end up here again.
5	G&D is one of my favorite spots to meet up with friends! They have great Happy Hour specials and even when it is not happy hour, their prices are very reasonable. Almost daily they have something going on. Poker, Trivia (my fav) and karaoke, sports. Their food is quite delicious as well. My favorites are the Hummus and the Curry Chicken.Their staff is wonderful as well. Customer service is huge to me and they are top notch! Always a smile to go with your drink. The owner is great as well. He walks around telling jokes and interacting with the customers. Give this place a try, you will not be disappointed! Cheers!!
4	The food was fantastic. Me and my boyfriend went and enjoyed the food greatly. He said, "I only wish they had more food." I'm only giving four stars because although the foods was good and our waitress fantastic, I've been here before and know it can take some time to get your food; other than that this place is great. Divert ask me about their alcohol though, because I don't drink. They did seem to have a large selection available however.
2	There was a college bar near a University on the East Coast that I used to go to many years ago that always smelled like a cross between stale beer and bathroom cleaner.   I am glad those days are gone, but when I walked in the door here, that same smell (although fainter) greeted me.  Unfortunately, it's not pleasant.  I know this place is trying to be a British pub,  but it seemed more like a biker bar with the loud music, crowd and dinginess during dinner time.  It's almost like they don't give a crap about the restaurant tables.Our server was nice and he did a good job and my food was also decent.  The burger ordered was just okay,  but I couldn't help feeling awkward.   The dingy bar and drinking crowd in the middle of the restaurant just doesn't work for me.  I feel like there is so much confusion, is it a biker bar, is it a restaurant, is it a biker bar in a dingy restaurant? British pubs have more of a cozy rustic feel and this place has none of that.  They could do so much for so little money to make the restaurant area just a little bit nicer or at least some cozy accent lighting so you don't feel so awkward eating here with your family.  I noticed other people felt awkward here as well.  Won't be back.
4	Go Thursday nights (9pm) for the live trivia, it's the best in the valley. Drinks are very reasonable (I think Guinness was 5.25 not during happy hour, which runs from 4-7pm and after 11pm). High quality fish and chips, shepherds pie, and even curry, just like a real British pub. An old favorite.
4	I love GnD! The owner is so great, he's hysterical, full of stories, and charming. Monday nights are karaoke. Watch out, people take it very seriously. My girl and I laughed our way through Sir Mix A Lot, only to have a world class karaoke-r go after us and put us to shame. Thursday is trivia, come early as it gets PACKED. Happy hour is from 4-7, $1 off all drinks, making a Jameson $4.95, hell ya. The bartenders are all friendly, make a strong drink, and are attentive. There's also a jukebox for you to pick your poison, darts, and pool tables. Some of the best fish and chips around. The potato skins are a god send after drinking for 3 hours straight. Everyone who comes here seems to be a regular, gives off a legit English pub vibe.
5	Found this place by driving by. It was only place after driving a few miles that was busy, so, must be a good sign on a Sunday night. The waiter was very friendly. We  had to try the fish and chips...outstanding. Not greasy and you actually get fish instead of gready batter with a little fish. Drinks were good and strong. The owner was there and came by to greet our table. After ready some previous post on Yelp, some reviewers thought the owner was rude, I totally disagree. He was a nice guy that cares about his business, otherwise he wouldn't be there and be in business for over 15 years.
5	Great food... Can not even explain the enjoyment from the Greek pizza! So delicious in my mouth! And the Guiness promo! The boyfriend got free glasses! AND for the desert... Berry cobbler... YUM! Just moved from beach area CA... So not biased! Please enjoy this place?
2	I really hate to give this place a less than stellar review because I want to like it so badly! The location is great, far enough out of downtown to avoid the clutter and close enough to have train access and feel like you're in a more urban area. Big family style benches allow for friend-making outside and individual tables inside. I'm surprised I came back after the first time. On a busier night, we couldn't get service to save our lives. We made sure we weren't stepping on toes by seating ourselves and sat, staring at servers running AROUND us for 15 minutes before going to the bar and begrudgingly ordering a beer from there instead. We sat and tried to shake it off while drinking one of many draft choices and waited, trying to make any contact with a server so we could get a menu or so I could merely ask where the bathroom was at-but nothing. I even timed how long it would take to get any attention without waving my arms around and after 10 more minutes we gave up. Apparently we were also given up on because the only interaction we had was the server rudely ripping our drink menu off the table without a word! That being the last straw, our feelings a little hurt, and trying to dial down why we felt like we were refused service, we left half full beers and walked out upset. I still over analyze the situation and try and figure out what in the hell we did wrong! Now, we came back to meet with friends almost a year later and service was slightly more decent. For mediocre bar food and bare minimum service that I usually have to flag down or jump straight to the bar for. I don't see all the hype in my own personal experience and that totally bums me out given that I like the atmosphere and location so much and so do many of my friends/coworkers. We still go here out of convenience and a quick beer occasionally but I can't seem to get the bad taste out if my mouth. Bummersville.
5	Enjoyed a fun night with friends. Best fish n chips! We had a party of at least 13 and the waitress was amazing.
1	It is rare that I post any reviews anywhere, but when I do it is either because the service was phenomenal, or on the other end of the spectrum as terrible.  This review fits into the second category.  Many years ago, I used to work in Phoenix, and used to eat lunch at the George and Dragon.  I used to be served promptly, the food was delicious, and I enjoyed the place.  But time has not been kind to this place.  We went on 03/22/2014We were kept waiting for 15 minutes before our 'server' brought us menus. We kept having to ask for refills on our sodas.  We placed our order, and she didn't write anything down, which is actually a peeve of mine.  We noticed other people came in, were seated, and then because they ordered alcohol were served their meals promptly, and the server scurried over to refill their drinks.  We called another server over twice to ask for refills, and he couldn't be bothered.  We ended up waiting almost an hour and a half before we ended up paying for our drinks and leaving.  We complained to the manager but he didn't seem to care either.  We walked out, and warned other patrons going in.  It is sad that what was a good place has slipped so far, and that the only customers that matter are those that order alcohol. Avoid this place.  Terrible service.  Enough said.
5	Strong drinks. Cheap drinks. Yummy food. Great location. Easy and laid back. One of my favorite bars.
5	There food is really good! Affordable and great food! We live right behind the pub and just walk right over!! Great service and probably one of the best Fish and chips!! Also their shepherds pie is pretty good!
5	It's A really nice English pub. Makes me feel like I'm back in the UK. Clean. Plenty of space. Friendly staff. Restrooms clean. Good food. Great beer. Felt real welcome. Lots of parking. User friendly.
1	Been meaning to try this place for years and finally had an opportunity. Unfortunately it was a huge let down. The first bad sign was that upon walking in every table table that wasn't occupied had not been cleared from the previous diners. During the 1 1/2 hrs (!!!) that we were here there were several tables that NEVER got cleared. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and another 45+ minutes until we received our food which was strange as no one else in the restaurant seemed to be ordering any food. There was a hair in the fish and chips (disgusting but mistakes happen), and the rest of the food was sub par at best. Having lived half my life in England  I've been to plenty of pubs and also eaten plenty of mediocre pub food (none to my recollection as tasteless as this). However I would imagine that if you're trying to emulate a British Pub across the pond you would only want to bring over the best of the best, not the worst of the worst. Even the sad little mini frozen sausage rolls I had as a child were better. I'm a bit horrified that this is the "taste of England" that is being imposed on unsuspecting Arizonians who don't know any better. I guess if you're just looking to knock back a pint or two and play pool and would only ever order food under the most drunk and dire of circumstances then you may enjoy this version of a pub. There certainly were a lot of regulars (not ordering food...). P.S. I don't know if that greasy little man was a busser or a patron. If he was a patron he had no business going into the kitchen as many times as he did, or eating on the floor. If he was a busser then it would have been nice to see him clear more than one table he did. And I most certainly hope it was not his stringy long hair that we found in the fish and chips, although I wouldn't be surprised.
5	My favorite bar ever! Live right down the street and I've been going here for past year, everyone there is super friendly and nice. I love the music, food, the beer! They also have pool tables and darts. And have karaoke night, trivia night, poker night, and ladies nights. Love this bar, if you haven't checked it out yet, you should!!!
4	Great place! My favorite in Phoenix! Great vibe, friendly staff, friendly patrons, darts, pool, good tap selection, good prices, and lots of space. It's a nice neighborhood bar. Cheers! :)
5	Moved over here from England and this is her truest taste of home. It is not an American English bar it is a true English pub. Loved it and the owner was great.  Can't wait to go back.
2	The food is bland which I guess is to be expected since it is English.  However, it was substance and not exspensive.
4	A cool place to sit and have a few drinks and chat with friends, it's not too loud to have a conversation. The beer selection is good and the drinks are strong so I felt I got my money's worth if your into pubs it's a good place.
4	This is a very nice place to chill and hang out watch sports. They have full service bar and lots tables for large groups. I hear it gets crowded for sport games and on them weekend. Always friendly good service and casual environment to chat and talk.
4	Love this place. I'm in the industry I come by after work. Great service great atmosphere. Kat and Jena are awesome!
5	Great food & beer selection. Fun staff. very authentic looking bar. Their lunch specials are really good too.  Good place to watch sporting events. Highly recommend.
4	If you're looking for a good bar in the downtown area this is definitely the place to be! Their massive selection of beers and cocktails is endless. Although their food is not my favorite, the service and selection of beverages makes up for the 'meh' food. I have met the owner a couple of times and he definitely is a good time, I love how interactive and attentive the bartenders are and even on their busiest days, they find a way to accommodate you. During the winter/spring time, you can grab a nice refreshing drink and make your way to the park festivals available at Indian Steele Park. My favorite drink to order is the cucumber vodka and soda. I think this is the only bar that has cucumber vodka, anytime I've asked for it elsewhere I get a crazy look. Their TV's around the bar area are spaced out nicely and the outdoor seating is awesome during the fall/spring months.
4	This place was not bad. Their draft milk stout was delicious and we ordered chips that were quick and tasty. The bartender Jen? Is a sweetheart. Will return.
4	Traditional english pub with English beer on tap. Cheap happy hour. I would leave the appetizers and focus on getting a traditional english dinner. Also the puddings are brilliant! We have tried a variety of things on the menu and all was good. Kind of funny, but my favorite is their english curry, nice and spicy on a bed of brown rice and naan bread. They lost a star because the service is just so-so, takes a bit longer to get the ball rolling than needed.
3	Had seven hungry guys there after a hard day on the job. Ordered drinks, appetizers and entrees. I will say the service was a little slow and smoky but vibrant.  The owner stopped by and said hi. Actually he said 'ello. When he found out that this was our first time he took a few more minutes to get to know each one of us better - was a class act and very friendly. I did not see the Halo Burger listed on the reviewed. It was a nice sized one third pound hamburger with a large pan fried cheese garnish so the presentation was very excellent and the burger itself is a little greasy. The bill for seven of us was $200 including tip. My test for the quality or likability of a restaurant has to do with would I return to the place and I have to say that this is one place I probably would return to solely with a large group of people who just want to hang have a little fun relax enjoy the atmosphere. You'll notice and some of the other reviews Thursday night is trivia night and the owner went through about 30 reasonably tough questions of succeeding difficulty. It's just kind of fun in the background with conversation and play while the rest of the crowd disappears in the background.
1	This place is dirty, the owner is miserable and the food is terrible. It's amazing they have been in business this long.
5	This place is awesome! Great ambience, friendly staff, and great food and beer. This was a phenomenal first experience, an I will be back.
3	Stopped by here tonight with a few friends-- it wasn't what I expected. I have a few friends that rant and rave about this place, but I honestly found it to be okay. It wasn't fantabulous.First, they played country music. I love country, but I found it a little odd that it was playing at a pub.Second, the food was ok. Our waitress said that the bread pudding was amazing...it was alright. Rula Bula's is much better.However, our waitress was the bomb. She made us Irish Mules even though they weren't on the menu :) And they were very good!!!All in all, it was alright. I didn't think it was amazing, but it wasn't bad, either.
4	Great service, divey location, but I liked it. Stopped for a couple beers and had a Meatloaf sandwich. It was pretty simple, but still good. Fries were a bit boring. I'd probably go back to try some of their traditional English Pub Food, just wasn't in the mood for experimenting last night.
4	Stopped in for lunch and drink. Was during the day so it was pretty mellow. My server, who was also the bartender was very helpful and friendly. Made me a great bloody mary and I ordered the stuffed meatloaf. It was fantastic. Definitely going to be stopping in again.
4	I really like this spot! The servers and customers are very friendly. They have pool tables and plenty of TV to watch the game.I ate the meatloaf, which was not awesome, but it was pretty good. I'll go back to find out how good is their fish and chips.
4	Not bad for my first visit!! Not sure which red door I was supposed to use at 1st. But use the one on the south side ;-)Okay, service is great during the lunch hour I came by. I'm a big pub guy...cuz I love fish n chips,  and I have to have a Black Velvet! BONUS HERE! For you black velvet fans, they offer not only Guinness, but Left Hand Nitro Milk Stout...so I asked if they could use the milk stout for my back velvet...YES, so try it, it's AMAZING!Also,  I went with the lunch menu chicken tacos...I was really expecting like 4 Oz of chicken...boom, I got prolly over 7oz. .. they packed it on and I was pleasantly surprised! I think the owner (dressed nicely) even brought it to my table which shows they go the Xtra mile. The waitress was right there for me several times! She was on point.The music was nice and low so I could do Internet work, and they have free wifi so I didn't have to bother with putting in a password to use it. I will be back!
4	Came here while traveling through Phoenix a while back.  I got the pasty.  It came with some English sides.  I also used ketchup like a yooper.  Great dish.  Had the milk stout on tap.  Great choice.
2	Oh King George,King of the Phoenix dive barsI live so closeI require no carsYou have pub food of plenty And patrons a manyBut consuming such greaseMakes me feel like a pieceYour beer doesn't please meAnd leaves me feeling slightly queasyA dungeon of darknessWith lights so dimA place void of nobles and youthMost patrons barely have more than a toothMy visits here leave me full of sorrowI guess see you again tomorrow....
5	great food ESP Sunday roast. brings a little bit of home to phoenix.  GREAT BEER and friends can be found here
