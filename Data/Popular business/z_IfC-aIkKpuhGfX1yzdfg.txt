5	Alex'is is the perfect place to bring a client.  They serve dinner and lunch.  The nice atmosphere is conducive for conversation and eating.  There is massive lightrail construction going on in fornt of the restaurant though so getting in and out is not as easy as it used to be, but in soon time it will be back to normal.Anyhow, Alexi's is a nice place. It has it's old Phoenix charm.  The owner, Michael is also the owner of Christo's.  Today, I had the filet minon and veggies, it was delicious!Gov. Janet Napolitano is a fan! I hear she frequents the restuarant.
4	Old school Italian restaurant located on the first floor of a Central Ave. high rise, Alexi's delivers great food with great service. The room is nicely appointed (nicely appointed?...who says things like that?), comfortable and really reminds me of an upper westside NYC restaurant. Pasta pomodoro, shrimp parmigiana, minestrone soup, house salad all dee lish. It reminds of an NYC restaurant. Hostess in a tight dress. Waitresses all with big hair. Older waiters, follicly challenged and oddly all with moustaches. Naked Cowboy on the sidewalk. Ok, maybe not THE naked cowboy. But one day I did see a cowboy type with daisy dukes and a muscle shirt that read "My belt buckle's bigger than yours". Hmmm. Anyway, the clientele seems to be older Scottsdale type, women in furs and men with furry backs, who dare to venture into Central Phoenix. Me? I show up in my board shorts, Hello Kitty flip flops and a muscle shirt that says "My debt is bigger than yours". ENJOY yelpers!
5	I can't understand what happened with Patti's group???I've been eating here for I don't even know how many years.Originally opened by Christo (yeah, *that* Christo with the restaurant up on 7th St.), this is an absolute fav for a business lunch or dinner. or dinner on the way to the theater, ballet, symphony, etc.Not unusual to see Gov. Napolitano, Mayor Gordon, business & civic leaders and somebody in jeans at the same time.Great service!  Wonderful food!  You call it & I'm there!
4	So my sister says come meet us for drinks! I say OK where to!?!?! Off to Alexi's hmmmm ok I trust you! It was after 7 and dead dead dead in here. The wait staff and bartender were watching baseball I think I'm not so sure so theres like 7 of us thirsty folk we just went to drink so this review is solely based on service pretty much. Nice open patio with no one else being there we were able to be as rowdy as we wanted. I would however like to try their food and see if it is any good. Everyone was very polite and attentive there ended up being 12+ people and they didnt separate the tabs so minus the one star so sorry.
4	I was invited to a Christmas party at Alexi's I  tagged along for the free booze but the food was amazing. For appetizers they served stuffed mushrooms, jumbo shrimp cocktail , and crackers with cheese. For dinner we were served chicken marsala, halibut topped with feta cheese and tomatoes, and tortellini alfredo.  Everything was fresh and delicious I was really impressed by the quality of food that was served I will definitely be back for more :)
2	Wow, what a downer for my only chance to eat out in Phoenix.  Here on business with many colleagues, the choice was made to eat at Alexi's since it was an extremely short drive to the hotel where we were staying. Our party consisted of 8 adults who were all extremely hungry and ready to place our orders after waiting for a table for a short period of time..not more than 15 minutes.  For a Monday night, I must say that the place was pretty packed.  The server was a very kind, sweet man who came across as quick, but lagged terribly with everything.  I am thinking it could have well been the delay inside the kitchen--not him...as again, he was pretty efficient.We ordered some appetizers of caprese = good, and fried calamari = ok.  Their bread that they provide = okay--nothing extraordinary.Most of us were ready to order quite quickly, but the food just took absolutely forever.  We probably started eating our food around 8:30pm, after being there for more than an hour munching on our appetizers which were devoured in seconds and sipping on our beverages.The food all in all, everyone said was mediocre and regretted what they ordered.  The steak was dry, my colleague said, the sauce was too heavy and drowning the food, another said, and so on... One colleague left her nearly full plate behind and said that the taste was off from what she was expecting. I ordered the chicken marsala which was really good actually, but just way too much sauce...You couldn't even taste the chicken--just sauce!For a hungry bunch of out-of-towners, Alexi's was certainly nothing special. I probably wouldn't recommend this place to anyone coming to downtown Phoenix...business or pleasure.  I gave them two stars because the server was very cordial and the servers overall gave a nice impression.
2	So...I've driven by this place a million times and always wanted to try it. What a disappointment! My family is Italian and this place is as Americanized as it gets! I got the vodka tortellini dish. Was NOT good. If you are looking for an awesome vodka sauce, check out Maggiano's in Scottsdale. It's the best I've had here in Phoenix.The atmosphere is really odd almost slightly creepy. We went for dinner and sitting in an office dinning room having dinner is somewhat strange. It is on the first floor of and office building so I can understand but still. Maybe this place makes more sense at lunch time but for dinner, weird. Check out their website and you will notice no pictures of the dining room.www.alexisgrillphx.comOur server was homophobic. There were three of us, myself and my two friends. He was cold and unfriendly. Being in the "gayborhood" I was pretty surprised. We all felt awkward and uninvited.Bad food, strange atmosphere for dinner, unfriendly server.I won't be coming back.
3	It's "Americanized" Italian - lots of "parmigiana" items, and Alfredo sauce - but for what it is I think they do a decent job of it. I had the eggplant parmigiana and it was surprisingly good! thick slices of eggplant with just the right texture, not greasy and not to cheesy. It filled me up enough to not be able to eat much of the linguine with red sauce. the red sauce was definitely serviceable, and the pasta fine but not exciting. My companions had the grilled salmon and the chicken. The salmon was a nice "lunch-sized" hunk. I was impressed by the option of drilled salmon and at least one other fish (I cannot remember what). The chicken-eater thought it was a bit dry, but commented that he thinks all restaurant chicken is dry...yeah, i too wonder why he keeps ordering it. The starter salads were a simple romaine hunks in a house dressing. Crisp and refreshing, but once again no excitement. I went for a business lunch and the atmosphere was perfectly enjoyable. Bright and airy, not too crowded. It's more business like than going to The Duck or Postinos (both of whose food is better), so it's a good option for taking clients, meeting associates, etc. to talk shop. I wouldn't make it a destination place, but it's a perfectly acceptable uptown lunch option. I don't think I'd bother with it for dinner.
5	Alexi's is somewhere between Greek and Italian, closer to the latter. No matter - each entree is outstanding in its own right. Last time in the desert cannelloni was spicy and delicious - and totally hopped up on chile peppers. The salmon salad - magnificent - and perfectly cooked. The food is excellent AND it's a great place to hob-nob. The area has a loyal clientele of movers and shakers. Alexi's is highly recommended in midtown - one of the best places especially for lunch in Phoenix.
4	We've been taking our 90 year old neighbor to Alexi's for years, what's not to love? The service is the best and the food is fine. Also great people watching when the symphony is happening.
3	My mom & I came here for dinner before the Michael Buble concert a couple weeks ago. The white table cloths & bow-tie clad waiters made the place seem a bit stuffy. And it definitely felt like most of the diners there were 50+ (maybe they have a good senior citizen discount?). For an appetizer we ordered the fried calamari. I thought it was pretty good, my mom thought it was too greasy & she might have been right. For dinner I ordered the grilled halibut, the halibut was very good (minus the tomato & cheese on top- I took them off). But the veggies that came with it, not so much. They gave me a lousy 3 wedges of red potato, a bland tasting piece of broccoli & way too sweet carrots. My mom ordered the grilled vegetable pasta. She thought it was too salty but I thought it was pretty tasty. The garlic & pesto sauce was so good! Oh & our meals came with a side salad, that only came with one option for dressing. Some creamy, lemon concoction that was not good, what ever happened to good old ranch?! For dessert we ordered the flan. It was pretty good but I've definitely had better.It wasn't bad or anything but I really doubt we will come back. Maybe for happy hour but it's doubtful.
4	The food at Alexi's is good.  Lunch time chicken pitas were my favorite, and at night for the occasional dinner I'd get one of the fish entrees.The atmosphere is a bit odd, but the servers are good natured and quick.The only reservation I'd have is the odd treatment I sometimes got by the host(ess) when I did not have a reservation.  I was a regular at this place for a long time.  Occasionally though I'd forget to call ahead to reserve a table.  Even if the place was completely empty, without a reservation the host(ess) many times will become visibly annoyed and act as if it is a big deal to find you a table and then put you in a corner somewhere.I don't know if everyone feels that way, or if it was only a way to try to condition me to call ahead next time since they knew my face.Overall however, other than that, it is a decent place to go for the occasional grub.
5	It is by far one of the best meals I have EVER had! Although it seems to not be 100% authentic Italian- it is Italian based, fresh, and wonderful! I only wish this wasn't the only location as I am here on travel. And only $12!
5	Been awhile since I've reviewed but Alexi's deserves another shout. I'm glad to report they keep adding different specials that have been a treat. The scallops where absolutely wonderful!! As usual, the service was GREAT. The whole staff makes you feel very welcome and that is a rare thing in this day. We still take our 90 year old neighbor out every Saturday and she insists on Alexi's. The way the staff dotes over her I know why! Keep up the great work.
1	Our waiter decided to increase his tip. Mentioned it to a friend who also visited this place during a football tournament and the same thing happened to them. Have to hate sneaky waiters, he was a good one too. Shame. Food was tasty but I wonder how many other people are being overcharged by this one waiter. Is it acceptable behavior in that place? Are other waiters also doing this?
3	The manager has contacted me after the weekend and refunded the tip plus an additional credit. So I was pleased with the way the management handled the situation. Thank you for taking care of this!
3	Had a late lunch here earlier this month with a friend. We enjoyed siting on the patio. The bartender was a nice guy and attentive. We placed our order with him and later a server came on and took over and though he was a bit awkward and odd he provided nice enough service.I opt to have the Crispy Calimari as a starter. At first it wasn't very good at first -not crispy and too oily, but we sent it back to be cooked longer so that it was crispy and my lunch partner agreed that made it much better.I had the Trout (farm-raised always a let down of sorts) Almondine ayet  I was very pleased with it! I would return again to have it.  My friend had the suggested Chicken Piccata dish that is popular there. It was okay, we could both tell that the chicken was prepared solo and the sauce added afterwards, then again we both cook and I have made this dish a number of times and know it well.  The side dish was a lame serving of a few (and I'm serious about a few) wedges of red potatoes like maybe 3 or 4 wedges and 2 crowns of broccoli!  Also we both had the house salad that was a nice mix of greens with the house dressing (you get no salad dressing choices!).We had 2 glasses of wine each from the happy hour list and mine were very nice. Then we had the strawberry cheesecake. Huge slice! However lacking on the strawberries and enough sauce to properly dress the cake which alone had a wonderful texture but lacked flavor.Knowing this dessert is the one thing I would certainly change on a future visit.The menu has a nice variety of options and the prices were within an acceptable range of $7 to $12 for this somewhat upscale lunch setting.
5	Great Happy Hour! Can't wait to try the lamb. Also a real treat to see Micheal working!!!!!
5	I travel a lot on business, and this is my must go to restaurant in downtown Phoenix. Terrific service in every way. Problem is I never get to try other items on the menu because one dish demands I order it every time. The Halibut Athenia is simply put the best fish preparation I've ever had. Huge portion of fresh halibut oven roasted with tomatoes, feta cheese and herbs. Words do not do it justice. Not on the regular menu but often a special. Just ask for it. It's unbelievable.
3	Went for lunch today with my husband.  Loved the amtosphere of the restaurant.  Easy to find and easy to park.  The service was attentive and good.  The iced tea was fresh and cold.  The small bread sticks that they serve you were just okay.  Not to flavorful and nothing to dip in accept plain olive oil.  The salad that came with the meal was large and the dressing good.I ordered the eggplant parmesean and didn't care for it.  It was like 6 very thinly cut pieces of eggplant dipped in egg and fried.  Gooey texture, eggy taste.  However, the linguini with red sauce that came on the same plate was delicious and I'm not usually a fan of pasta with red sauce- to boring.My husband ordered the Southwest Chicken Marsala.  It sounded amazing on the menu but didn't look nearly as good as it sounded.  Very little cheese on top and mostly green peppers swimming in a sauce on the chicken.  He drank coffee with his lunch.The bill was $25 with tax.  I thought that was very reasonable for a nice lunch.If I ever go back I will try something else on the menu.
2	I used to travel to Phoenix for work, which was one of the benefits of that job.  This restaurant in downtown Phoenix came highly recommended by several of the secretaries I was working with and since it was in walking distance of the office, I decided to give it a try.  To be totally honest, it sucked.  Complimentary bread and soup was served for starters.  The bread was stale and I've had better soup out of a can.  The server was so busy flirting with the tall and very tanned ladies at the table next to me to pay much attention to the rest of his customers.  He spent a good deal of the time ignoring me; I was constantly having to ask him for things I shouldn't have to ask for--such as a fork or a drink.  The menu is pretty extensive; though low on the veggie options.  I chose the bowtie pasta with veggies.  It was carrots, zucchini and peppers in a light herb sauce which was bland and served just barely warm.  Very disappointing!  Due to the slow service of the flirty waiter, I was there far longer than an hour and got back to work late, out about $15 and still hungry.  Don't waste your time!
4	Excellent food served well in a very comfortable ambiance.  Great before or after Theatre!
3	Abridged: Good food, hotel restaurant feel.I headed to Alexi's with friends for some good old carbs & veggies before a run on a Saturday night. When I arrived, I was a little worried as the over starched burgundy table decor and lack of patrons made me think of a stiff uncomfortable hotel restaurant.Our server was friendly and knowledgeable, and the menu looked fantastic with so-so prices. I ended up getting the primavera dish and stayed with water for my drink. The food was great, even down to the bread. I devoured it with pleasure! In the end though, I don't think the patrons or staff were amused with the out of ordinary conversations my friends and I often like to have. The food was good enough that I won't write it off my list, but I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't welcome my kind any more haha!!
1	This review can not comment on the food at Alexi's because frankly we left.We patiently waited for over 10 minutes for a waiter to ask us about drinks or bring a menu, no dice. They seemed understaffed and had a large group, but that is no excuse for completely ignoring a table.I was also shocked at the causal attire of some of the guests. I realize its summer and all, but the table next to us one gentleman was in a white tank top. Not my expectation for this type of restaurant.So while we didn't dine at Alexi's, we did patron the owner's other restaurant and had a wonderful experience (as we always do).
4	Good food, great service -this place is good to impress your clients and your date.
1	Over the past seven years, we (Wife and I) have dined here, about 6 times.We had just left the Theatre ... saw a wonderful Sherlock Holmes play.****Arrived at Alexi's, at 4:45pm, on Saturday 22nd.****Restaurant is empty, with the exception of three tables.****Hostess, is insistent on seating us , in "cubby holes" or corners.****Told Her .... NO.****We'll dine elsewhere if necessary.****Finally, we were offered a "proper" table.  As other Diners, were arriving, she's playing the same "cubby hole" game, with them. TSK ...TSK ...Where is the ownership ?????Then again, it appeared, she was "following orders"!                                 Now For The FoodOn this visit, and ALL past visits, I always have  the Chicken Marsala Southwest.My wife, on this and past visits, always has the Chicken Piccata.*****Both were over cooked.*****Both were BLAND.*****Both were not the entrees, we had come to expect at Alexi's.                                   Bread and Salad*****The dinner rolls were tasteless....Thank Goodness for the Butter and salt on the table.*****The House dressing on the salad was ICK (my wife) ...and YUK (me).Alexi's, Thank You .... for the past dinning experiences.As for the Future .... WE WILL NEVER RETURN, on our "dime".
5	This place is the best in town! I get whatever soup they have when I come here, and it never disappoints. They give meaning to what true hospitality looks like. The staff is friendly and personable from the bartender to the bus boys; they treat you like family. This is a hard trait to maintain when one runs such a high quality restaurant, but they manage to have such a great balance without it feeling stuffy. I would recommend this place for large parties, catering, or for a great happy hour. I promise you won't be disappointed.
5	I have eaten here many times, have had a positive each time and finally writing a review. With great food, good wine selection, personal attention, I cannot find anything that was not positive. My friends joined me for dinner. We loved the halibut and the lamb chops, even had a cappuccino and shared ice cream for dessert. Basically plan to have meal plus wine with shared dessert for $40 per person before tip. (Want a sale or appetizer before that then it will cost more, but I had plenty to eat with what I had.) The waiter was great. Knew everyone's name within a minute and was pleasant throughout the evening. I have in another time eaten at the bar because I was there by myself; enjoyed the bar atmosphere while talking with some folks and also watching the TV program...I think it was sports. Once again, great beer and food.
4	Had a great time enjoying Northern Italian with some Greek options also.  This place has it ALL! Duck, veal, shrimp, salmon, lamb, halibut, chicken, pasta, calamari, and meatballs!  It was all very delicious and the service was great.  The servers had great personalities and the ambiance is upscale and dim.  Nice patio also.  Accessible via the lightrail for those of you that take advantage of public transportation.
5	Best Veal Chop I've ever had; melted in my mouth.  Chicken Rice Soup like Mom used to make.  Carrots and brocoli cooked perfectly.  And Good Service and Ambiance.
2	I usually give 4 STARS to all restaurants; but had some challenges:Here are the positives:The special fish dish (cod); it was excellent; moist and very tasty.The trout was something I would order; even though I don't like trout.The carrots and the soup was great.Now the negatives: Getting stuck in the "cubby" hole table.Hostess not letting the waiter know, that he had another table; so had to wait for menus and service.Kept adjusting lights; up & down, up & down - how long have you been in business???Water glasses; ended up completely dry - before I could "flag" another waiter down; only having him "yell" to the our waiter; that we needed water.Chef came out to greet other guests/table; but not ours.If you are a regular guest; you get good service.Won't be a regular guest; I guess.
1	The food is terrible. We went for happy hour and get the caprese and the calamari. The caprese was like eating diced tomatoes that had been stewing in something. The calamari was small and predominately breading.
2	NOt a fan. Very strange place with mediochre food. The marsala sauce was thick and cold. The staff was not very friendly and the service was sub par. I will not be returning.
1	Gross food should be on the tv show restaurant impossible. If you disagree please eat at Olive Garden, Old Spaghetti Factory, Babbo's, Time Square, or probably any other phoenix italian restaurant.
4	The food was very good and the service was great.
5	Always an excellent meal... Have never been disappointed eating here!!
5	Great place, with a $5 Food Happy Hour Menu, $3 imports and more!  Check it out!
5	Our party of four (with four different entrees) give Alexi's Twenty (20) Stars!  Rack of Lamb, Veal Chop, Pasta, and Chicken all great and despite a large private party and a full-restaurant served Impeccably.  These people know how to run a restaurant.
2	Well, I had great expectations for the food here after reading the great reviews. We were seated very quickly, but our waiter from the start acted as though we were inconveniencing him. I ordered Scampi, it was slightly overcooked and the tails were burnt to black; the pasta and sauce were very good though; my friend ordered the cod, it was extremely overcooked and she asked for a new piece.Towards the end of our meal, we could hear him whining to his co-workers (this was a very loud conversation as the staff were behind the prep area going to the kitchen) that we were the ones who sent food back to the kitchen. I, and my friend, will not be going back, and we will make sure to discourage our friends from going. The food was mediocre and the service was unprofessional.
5	Love it here!  The happy hour is great, especially if you like $3 Fat Tires to go with your $5 appetizers.  For those of you who don't like beer, check out their wine menu and don't forget to eat some delicious food while you are at.  My favorite?  Too many to list, but if it comes from this kitchen, its GOOD!
5	Fine dining for average folk! I love this place.  There were three specials going on that were off menu which caters to different diets I suppose. The flounder dish I had was excellent
5	I just had another wonderful dining experience at Alexis today.  I have been coming here for 18 years now.  It is my favorite restaurant in the Valley.  Everyone is friendly - they treat you like family.  The prices are very reasonable, the service is super, and the food speaks for itself!  It is also a fun place for parties.  I have celebrated several birthdays here.  I highly recommend Alexis!
5	Alexis has two very nice ladies for Hostesses.  Lola and Channelle - they greet everyone and make you feel like a VIP!
4	Located in the mid-town area, Alexi's has been the go-to place for executive professionals, politicians etc. since it opened in 1994. And most of the same staff is still there...including the chef! That alone speaks volumes.The menu centers around northern Italian, continental and Mediterranean cuisine. We started with the combo appetizer. Yum yum! No rubbery calamari here! And the shrimp and tortellini were awesome. For entrees, we opted for the salmon and the halibut special. Again - to die for. Perfectly prepared, beautifully presented, moist and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.The desserts looked incredible, but all we had room for was some spumoni ice cream. I know, I know...but it was a nice change all the same...and refreshing!Our waiter was great, made sure all was to our liking as well as personable and friendly. We got there a bit early on a Saturday evening, but by the time we left around 7:30pm, the place was packed, and the patio was filling up.Alexi's is not "trendy" or "industrial chic", and the interior may need some refreshing, but the food is excellent - and a great value. Prices are remarkably reasonable and the portions are healthy.
4	Great lunch specials on Pasta every day about ~$7 (to go only).  The sauce is delicious and the food is very healthy. Add the salad or soup too if you're dining in.  Haven't tried their happy hour but will do that soon.
5	Just had a wonderful dinner at Alexis!  Tonight most of the restaurant was closed for a wedding party.  They had a dance floor and a DJ.  It is a beautiful setting for such an event.  As always, the service, ambiance, and food rocked!  I am planning my upcoming wedding there too!
5	Went for dinner this weekend for my husbands birthday dinner was nice. Large portions. Will come back again
5	Tonight I had roasted duck.  It was the most delicious duck I have tasted in a long time.  I highly recommend it!  As usual  - the service was flawless too.  Alexis is the perfect place to start a Saturday evening.  It is right on the light rail route and you can take in a ball game or go to the Phoenix Symphony.
4	Alexi's is a Phoenix classic. Great food, great service, but old menu. You can always count on Alexi's for a good meal, of epic proportions that will be very filling.
3	Sooo sad tonite. My food ok, but husband's drink started out with a majorly cracked martini glass, the wrong dish served & no one coming by to make sure all was ok. The restaurant wasn't full & the service definitely suffered tonite. It's a great value for good food though. I'm definitely disappointed that no management stopped over to check on us especially after this broken glass that they dared serve a drink in:(. We've been customers here for a long time:(  We never even received  an apology from the server.:(
3	So-so food. Nothing exceptional. We had the trout and salmon, and both were just okay. The bread rolls were good, and the salad had a pretty good dressing. The soup was just decent. Nice ambiance and location, and the staff was friendly. They should spring for some nicer plates and bowls though!
2	It took approximately 15 minutes from the time we were seated to receive water and menus, but from then they were somewhat attentive. I ordered a bloody mary before we started and it was, by far, the worst beverage I have been served in years. It was not drinkable. From there, unfortunately, things remained the same. Two of the meals we received were not described well by the waitstaff and needed to be replaced... of course after the rest of us had finished our dinner. I ordered the Chicken Zanagrelli which sounded excellent but was not executed well. The sauce was flavorful but the chicken was inedible from a consistency and flavor standpoint. When they cleared my plate they asked if I wanted a box to which I replied "no." The manager on staff that evening came over and apologized profusely for the meals that had been described incorrectly, and asked how the replacement meals were... to which one of the recipients said "pretty good" - now that should have been a clue that they were just being polite - a term like great or excellent would have been what they should have been listening for.  They really did try hard to fix the situation and they have lovely ambiance, but don't think this will be on the return list.
5	Excellent cateringMicheal catered my wedding reception and it could have not been betterOn time, food tasted great , the presentation was right on and great service.Every one was loving itThanks alexi grill
5	Had another great dining experience at Alexi's last night.  It was very busy but we were waited on immediately as if the place were empty.  The food was delicious.  They serve chocolate cake that is to die for!  Hope to see you there soon...:)
5	Thank you Alexi's for taking a large party of rambunctious hungry men at the last second. When 12 of us walked through the door and asked the hostess if we could be seated, she wasn't too sure. As soon as the owner came by he was like, "right away! Of course we can!"And they did! Within 15-20 mins we had a great table setup outside. Our server was very knowledgeable and quick with bread an water. We had a great time. The food was pretty good. I liked my Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken. It may have been a little too thick but I was good with it. Thanks again!
5	Alexi's patio is wonderful, and the happy hour appetizers make for great dinners.  One of our go-to places for an early meal.  Also, the staff is super-friendly, and our daughter is always welcome.
5	Just had a very filling dinner tonight at Alexi's.  Tonight we had the halibut and the roasted duck.  It was delicious.  I work for a nonprofit organization and we are organizing a fund raising dinner.  We would like to have Alexi's Grill cater the event.  It is that good!  All of the staff knows us by our first names and it is like dining with family!  It is a fun place to go to on First Fridays.  After dinner we hopped on the light rail and rode down to the Art Museum and other art galleries.  A fun packed evening!
5	This review is for Alexi's 3-7PM Happy Hour. Stopped in for a drink after work after a co-worker suggested we try Alexi's.  I am happy to report that the wait staff is quick and friendly, the restaurant looks clean and the food was spot on.  We had an order of the Happy Hour Calamari with Marinara ($5).  The Calamari was some of the best I have had and the Marinara was excellent.  We also tried the combo plate ($5) that came with more Calamari, 2 Shrimp Scampi and tortollini.  2 Cadillac Margaritas later plus 2 Chocolate Martinis for my co-worker ($5)ea and Alexi's Happy Hour proved to be a great place!
2	Decided to try this place for lunch because it is right by my office. I sat at the bar. The bartender was really unfriendly; not a word, not a smile. He silently delivered my coke and took my order. I got a chicken ceasar salad. The food came out quickly. Salad was underdressed, chicken was well seasoned, but overcooked. By this time the bartender was nowhere to be found so I couldn't get a drink refill. When he finally came back, I asked for my check and he silently delivered. So, I was not impressed with the place. I would tolerate bad service for awesome food, but since neither was impressive, I won't be going back.
4	Our team was in town for a project, so accommodating 12 for a last-minute seating can prove to be a bit challenging. The staff at Alexi's was friendly, and our waiter (I think his name is Thomas) was fantastic. His care and attention, plus friendly demeanor added so much to our dining experience. Our meals were delicious and the atmosphere allowed for conversations to be had without yelling to be heard. Would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a good Italian meal.
5	The veal chop and pasta was absolutely delicious.  The cocktails by Matthew were thebest we have ever had and we have had them all over the world.  Quality of food and service is exemplary.  Customers service is beyond exemplary.  Thank you.  Jack and Bev Sinbelian
4	Haven't been back here for years.  What a pleasant surprise.   Food and service excellent.  Met the owner. Mike.  Most gracious.  And our waiter Thomas was super.  Prices very reasonable for the quality of the meal. And generous wine pours.  Definitely coming back.
4	The food was excellent, wait staff very efficient and the parking was easily accessible and convenient.  All meals were very reasonable in price as well as the drinks.  Could use a larger wine variety.
5	I had the pleasure of attending a friends wedding last weekend that Alexi's Grill catered. This was such a class act. The staff were so professional and Michael managed the event perfectly. You had the sense that everything was taken care of, no worries. The presentation was fabulous, creative and fun. You can see that this establishment and its owner take great pride in the quality of every aspect of the event. Now to the food. OMG the appetizers were incredible. So fresh and full of flavor. Dinner was exceptional. Hot like your mother just took it from the kitchen amazing mushroom sauce on the chicken, cooked perfectly. Oh and they prepared some food outside so the aroma was like you were in Florence. Seriously.The pasta was out of this world, vegetables cooked just to the point of a crunch.Bread, yum.And of course desert, I tried them all. Absolutely a 10. You can not go wrong with this caterer. I have also enjoyed lunch and happy hour at the restaurant. It is such a class act. Do not miss this gem. Quality all round and a complete pleasure of an evening.
5	The lunch menu is amazing and affordable and goes to 4pm. The happy hours is from 3 to 7 and are excellent at a very good price.   The service is friendly and fast.   Will go back for sure.
