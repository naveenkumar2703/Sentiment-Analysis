5	I have never had a bad meal here.  The place is small and unassuming but it can get pretty busy during lunchtime.  I usually get one of their combination platters where you basicaly pick any three dishes on the menu and they bring it to you with a pile of fresh warm injera bread which I honestly think is my favorite part of Ethiopian food.I usually opt for one meat and two vegetable dishes because it's a lot of food either way and I feel like I have a better chance of finishing if I go with two vegetables.  I've had the beef, the lamb, the chicken, the cabbage, the red lentils and the green beans and they are all good but my favorite is probably the lamb with cabbage and green beans.Five stars for being the only Ethiopian food around and mighty tasty.
4	I must admit, I don't think Ethiopian food is my end all, be all. I've had it twice since moving to Phoenix. It's not that I shy away from eating with my hands. It's not that I don't appreciate the culture, or how unique of a dining experience this is... authentic as you're going to get in the Valley, I can imagine. It's not any of those things... I think it's the food. Now, c'mon, I'm not going to lie. The food is tasty. It's just not what gets me going. I went to Lalibela with a couple co-workers. I was looking to get out of the office and enjoy some chit chat. Mission accomplished. Yet, can 3 people seriously get full from sharing a plate of Lalibela's finest? I think not. Besides, I get kinda skeeved out when dirt or food gets caught under my nails. Yikes. (Watching my co-workers pick at their fingers after the meal was not the most pleasing way to polish off my lunch.)Sounds like I'm complaining, right? Well, I'm not trying to. I mean, this place is good. Don't get me wrong! I s'pose if you enjoy Ethiopian food and eating with your hands (and strange textures and really thin bread), then this is the place for you. I give it 4 stars for what it is: a really good Ethiopian restaurant... With, if you didn't know, really good chai tea. Oh, and the food... Well, I'll let you decide for yourself. Maybe it's your end all, be all.
4	Great Ethiopian restaurant in Tempe.  Compares very favorably with Ethiopian restaurants in Washington, DC, Dallas, and New York City...We ended up at an Ethiopian restaurant (Cafe Lalibela). We ordered lamb, chicken (doro wat), beef along with potato, green beans, and turnip greens for veggies. Very tasty. Silky bread here compared favorably to Addysbia in Dallas. Prices were incredibly low. If I hadn't completely destroyed the USB Card Reader, I would have pictures of the great food. Also didn't get to take a picture of the girl in the corner that got Viper dubbed the name "Mr. Obvious". Her boyfriend looked annoyed.  :)
5	This place is amazing. I have yet to have something there that I did not love and I have been there plenty of times.The food and experience is wonderful, there are plenty of meat and vegetarian options on the menu and the way it is served will make everyone happy. The food is brought to you on a plate on top of injera, a flat, spongy, moist bread with a taste similar to sourdough. Pieces of injera are torn off and used to scoop/grab bites of the portions, no silverware. They have traditional Ethiopian drinks and liquor, too.They have lunch specials where the portions are served wrapped burrito style, which was my first experience and absolutely amazing.Cafe Lalibela is a must, something wonderful to experience, a delightful culinary peek into another country and culture. You won't be disappointed.
5	My husband and I came to Lalibela's for Valentine' Day and it was the perfect dinner. Every time we eat at Lalibela, we keep wondering why we don't make the short drive there more often.Tonight, we tried one of the Ethiopian wines, a sweet red called Axumit. It was nice -- I think they might even sell bottles of it to take home,although I'm not positive.I love all the vegetarian dishes here, especially the Shiro Wat, which is ground peas with berbere and onion. Also, I always try to order their home-made crumbly white cheese to add to the dishes -- they're often out of it, because it takes a long time to make, but it's delicious if you can get some.The tiramisu and the coffee is also very good, as well as the Koranti, which is hot tea with some ouzo in it.Overall, this place is just fabulous. I've had Ethiopian food in places like San Francisco and D.C., and Lalibela's has come out on top every time. The crowd is pretty nice, too. Lots of people from varied backgrounds frequent the restaurant, as well as what I think of as the NPR crowd -- you know, the ones with glasses and funky jewelry who have loud, obscure conversations about astrophysics or medieval Bosnian literature or the deplorable state of the world's organic strawberry farms... that could be because Cafe Lalibela is a sponsor on KJZZ, though, which actually was the reason I sought it out when I first moved to Phoenix. Just another reason to support this place!
4	Hmm. I've been to Lalibela twice, both times for lunch, and had wildly different experiences. Now, I lived in Washington DC for a couple of years and developed a great love for Ethiopian food. DC has the world's second largest Ethiopian population (second only to Ethiopia) and the Ethiopian food there is divine. So I was hesitant about Arizona Ethiopian food, and my first trip was not encouraging. I went for lunch with a friend and ordered the three-item lunch sampler. The food arrived right on the plate - no injera to soak up the saucy goodness! A little disconcerting. There was also rice, which I've never seen in an Ethiopian place. And then, the real crime: a FORK. I was given a FORK. Heresy! But while the presentation didn't seem all that authentic, the food was delicious.The second time, though, also for lunch, was an entirely different experience. The food came atop injera on a big, round platter, the way I've always seen it done, and there were no forks! The food is amazing and I'll definitely be back, but man, I have to ding them a star for giving me a fork. Come on!
5	No complaints about Cafe Lalibela.  I now know where to get my Ethiopian fix in the Valley.  We ordered some kind of large platter, with vegetarian and meat selections.  It was DELICIOUS.  We also had some Ethiopian red wine that paired perfectly.  Mmmm.  Injera.
5	I have been going to Cafe Lalibela since it opened, which was a few years before I even moved to the valley.  I have never had a bad experience or anything less than excellent food.They have an enormous menu, but I usually tell the waitress to bring me whatever is good - and vegetarian.  The waitstaff is prompt, attentive and very helpful.The food is the star, from the injera to the teas, you simply can not go wrong at Lalibela.  Ethiopian food is unlike anything else, and it is SO tasty.My only problem is convincing my friends to go with me!
4	It would be difficult for any of us who haven't been to Ethiopia or have experience with a variety of Ethiopian cafes (maybe if you're from DC you could qualify) to be a stringent critic on the quality of Lalibela, but what I DO know is what tastes stunning regardless of a specific palate for niche-ethnic-food.Based on the savory deliciousness of the Lalibela Exclusive -- a party platter consisting of [doro wat, kye sega wat, alicha sega wat, misir wat, gomen, yebere sega tibs, fosolia, yebeg alicha sega wat, tikil gomen and yekik alicha served with ayeb and selata] uhm, food n stuff that you use to envelope with a sourdough-like flatbread made of teff flour, I will gladly hand over the coveted five-star rating.The platter had various meats -- beef, chicken, and lamb -- as well as lentils, beans, greens and herbs.  The vegans (level 4 - heh.) were able to share the meal along with the carnis without a complaint.  Between 6 of us we took down 1.5 platters.  The daunting task of finishing it all off was too much for us to handle, but i had no problem downing my Ethiopian light beer "Harar", which was honey-sweet and tasty and made for a perfect punch to wash all that culture down.
3	Great food. As someone who's traveled to Ethiopia, I can tell you that they do a fantastic job at cooking traditionally. However, D.C. and NYC Ethiopian restaurants kick ass in the states! Enjoy!
5	Lalibela, you are my favorite Ethiopian restaurant in the Valley. I travel to you from Sunnyslope as often as I can. Everything you serve (vegetarian) is delicious, and I often think of your food. Consistently delicious and satisfying you are. You have never disappointed me; this is why you are one of my favorite places that I will never turn down if offered.
5	Lalibela is the best Ethiopian restaurant in the Valley.  It's a thousand times better than Tina's in Chandler (don't waste your time).I was turned onto Lalibela by my friend, Filmon, who's Eritrean.  He agrees that Lalibela is the best Ethiopian restaurant in Phoenix!  In fact, it was Fil who turned me on to Ethiopian food as well!  His mother sent some doro wat and sega tibs to him and he shared it with me.  I'm originally from Kansas and had never tasted anything like it.  I loved it.  And thus began my love affair with Lalibela and Ethiopian food.I've eaten lunch at Lalibela three times and each time has been delightful and satisfying.  There wasn't a wait at any point during my three visits.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  The menu is easy to decipher - the dishes are explained in English.  The prices are good.I've sampled pretty much everything on the menu.  We always get a large platter with injera.  Doro wat, sega wat, gomen, sega tibs, kitfo (my favorite), and selata, to name a few.  They also serve drinks and have desserts (mostly Italian or American).  The food is a little greasy (mostly cooked in butter or animal fats), so it's best to have a hot cup of tea after the meal to break up the fat.  The restaurant itself is unassuming.  There are some nice touches.  They give you little wet naps to clean your hands before and after the meal, which is nice.  There's also a few interesting pieces of art on the wall - one of the most intriguing is the one that displays the Ethiopian alphabet, which is very large when compared to the English alphabet.My only disappointment: they're closed on Mondays!
4	I've been to Cafe Lalibela a number of times, and every time I leave stuffed and satisfied. The menu is a typical Ethiopian menu, with entrees, meat or vegetarian, served with "injera" (flat bread) but all the dishes I have tried have been as good or better than any other Ethiopian restaurants I have been to. My favorite is the fosolia (green beens + carrots), but really all the dishes are great. I went with some friends for the Ethiopian Millennium celebration Fall 2007, and was treated to a fully delicious buffet. Would definitely recommend if you like Ethiopian or are looking for a different experience.
4	I visited here with another couple friend of ours this past Friday, and was I pleasantly surprised. The four of us split there "combo" type dinner and it came out on this massive round tray/bowl with Ethiopian style bread. There were a variety of meats, including beef three ways, lamb, and chicken. There were lentils, peas, green salad, and a few other types of vegetable sides. The food was fantastic to say the least, and the dinning experience is so unique, you eat with your hands and use the bread to prevent you from getting it all over yourself. I truly enjoyed all of the new flavors and the social aspect of Ethiopian dinning.  The prices were also very reasonable, that monster dish was about $40.00. There are native Ethiopian wines and beers available (but I chose to take a night off from the sauce) so I can't tell you if they were good. If you are interested in broadening your food horizons I would most certainly suggest trying this place. Staff was also friendly and attentive (important to mention). This place is no frills though, and attire is definitely whatever goes. I think this is good for large groups as well as first dates and small parties!
5	As a former vegetarian/vegan, I've recently been discovering the (full, not substitutions or single-option style) menus of my favorite places. The vegetarian platter at this place is so good, though, that I really don't even have that desire. Okay, maybe I'm game for the chicken stew with a hard-boiled egg as an option, but come on. It's a stewed hard-boiled egg.  How could I not? Misir wat, the red lentil stew, is by far the tastiest thing on the vegetarian menu, but the gomen and fosolia (greens and green beans, respectively), are also good, and completely different. Each dish is seasoned differently, so the platters offer flavors that really compliment each other (rather than blending). No garlic overload or trite use of the same spices over and over. The greens are definitely sporting some garlic, but the green beans are sweet and light. Everything is stewed here, but the variety of meats and vegetables allows that. Plus, I think I read somewhere it's traditional? : )Salads are unimaginative, the vinaigrette is just that (but goes well with the bread, as vinaigrette tends to do), one tomato wedge per person rule seems to apply. I wish someone would ban iceberg from restaurants. Bread is amazing, spongy and sour. Soup is good, a bit salty, very thick and noodly. When low on cash, that plus one stew will do you ok. Beers are Ethiopian, as is the wine. I've tried both beers and the white wine they had, I favored the Harar beer with my meal.
3	wanta try something a little different and good?! hit this place!! ideal to go with a few friends and split the big combo... gives you a little bit of everything and oh so good!!
4	Lalibela was lovely. The staff was superb and friendly and the food, particularly the fosolia, was delicious. I tried the number 17 on the menu, which was a sampler of three dishes. One lamb, one beef and one vegetarian. The flavors on the lamb and beef dish were pretty similar, but it might have just been the combination I ordered. The injera was very spongy and sour, like sourdough bread. We all commented on the fact that it was very filling, so I recommend you use sparingly to start. Even though they recommend trying three entrees, I would probably have been happy and filled to capacity with two. I also enjoyed a tasty Ethiopian beer called Bedele. It was really hoppy, but good. Overall, a great experience. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more vegetarian dishes.
5	Love this place!After having a few other Ethiopian feasts at other restaurants, Lalibela is the best.  The food is fresh & perfectly seasoned.  TONS of vegetarian options.Can not complain about anything.
4	OMG, oh so good. Gives me gas and makes me tired after lunch, but it's well worth it.
3	I have been waiting to try Lalibela for a few weeks and was extremely excited to hit the cafe up last night. I must say, I was a tad disappointed.We had GREAT service. My drink was never dry and we got our food really quickly, but this could be because we got there at about 530PM and there was only one couple eating. The food was good, but not overly flavorful. We got great portions, but I think they were a little overpriced.The cafe itself is relatively cool. They have some interesting painting and artifacts on the wall and are in an easy to find location.I will go back again. It was good, but it wasn't great.
4	This place is very good.  I hit it up at least bi-monthly.  If you're vegetarian, this place is a must.
5	So good.  I have only ever had lunch here, and I usually just order the luncheon special of picking several dishes and enjoying them with the spongey bread (injera) and rice.  Doro wat which is spicy chicken, is amazing, the lentil and cabbage dishes are awesome, and....  drum-roll, the gomen is frickin fabulous.  Seriously, if you've ever doubted collard greens before (and I know they can be mischievous tricksters, hard to rely on) give them a second try.  And stir that second try with garlic and onions on a plate at Lalibela.  I think Gomen may possibly be my deserted island only food.  And maybe raspberries.  But not together.  The service is good, quick, friendly, and it's kind of an interesting place to people watch.  Now, that said, it could be a bit more like the Ethiopian restaurant I went to in Minnesota that turned into a no-cameras, funk club after 7, serving copious amounts of Tusker beer, named so after it's creator who was gored to death by elephants.  But it's not.  It's just Lalibela in Tempe, AZ.  And it's good, nay, great.  Because I go there to eat.  Not to dance to crazy live funk music and get inebriated off of elephant-death beer.
5	Been there many times and loved it every time. I tried many things from the menu and they are amazing especially for the spicy food lovers.Prices are reasonable but the lunch porsions can be a little bigger.
4	soooo delicious! I really miss this place. The veggie dishes are flavored to perfection. The lunch specials are an amazing deal and the owners/servers are friendly and attentive.  I only wish they served organic produce and meats!
5	Something amazing happens at Cafe Lalibela. The bread (whatever it's called, screw you elitists) expands in your stomach and continues to do so for hours after the meal. Shortly thereafter, you will fall asleep for twelve hours. It isn't really that unpleasant - you just won't be hungry again for another two days.The food is so great! And filling and hearty, and just GOOD! Nomnomnom. I've never eaten Ethiopian food before this, but somehow, it tastes like what Mom used to made. Warm, fuzzy feelings. If you can make it to dessert, have the Raspberry Mont Cake. It's a treat with several delicious raspberries at the base, surrounded by white chocolate mousse and a hard pyramid-shaped pink shell.I am so happy to live down the street from this fine establishment.NOM!
2	I honestly prefer the food served at the Blue Nile.  Too bad that Tina's Ethiopian Cafe in Chandler closed- her food was the tastiest I tried here in the valley.While I do like the environment here, I really dislike the slow service.  My first visit was for lunch with a coworker, and we both enjoyed the lunch fare.  My friend's beef tasted almost like Filipino adobo.  I had a veggie plate that, while flavorful, did not make me want to recommend it to others.  I've since tried it two more times with group members of the Phoenix Vegetarian Society.  Still do not like the service here.  I've always noticed that tthe servers do not smile, and it's like squeezing blood from a stone to start a conversation with the staff.  Tina and the servers at Blue Nile ALWAYS smiled and conversed with me.Lalibela's injera leaves me wanting for Blue Nile's better-tasting spongy bread. My aunt agrees with me, as well.  Also, the portions here are less than the portions I get elsewhere.
4	Lalibela is significantly better than Blue Nile, which is the other Ethiopian place in town.  Portions at Lalibela are larger and the food is also much better.  I've tried all kinds of different dishes, from the various meat dishes to some of the veggie dishes and even some of the interesting beverages they have, and it has all been good.  If you're looking for a unique but good dining experience, this is definitely a good place to go to.
4	I enjoyed this restaurant very much.  The food was good and tasted very "homemade".  I had the chicken, beef, and cabbage.  You can mix and match entrees or try one of their combinations.  There is a lot of flexibility and a lot of choices.  Of course, the main part of the meal is the bread, which is spongy and delicious.  The atmosphere is casual and service is friendly.  I will go back again.  It is good to eat something different once in a while.
2	This was real dissapointment because I really trusted the reviews but I realize there are couple of important factors. 1. this is college town 2. Az  (no offense) isn't the capital of great food. 3. a 20 yr palate is different from a 40+ yr old palate.Sorry to be such a snob but truly this food was just okay. If you're a foodie and really know great Ethiopian I would suggest you don't eat here. while the wait staff are really wonderful the food was just okay, presentation is nothing like usual Ethiopian fare (family style). The Dobo Wat was ordinary and my favorite (Gomen) was tasteless. they didn't include that grumbly cheese and my Doro didn't have the typical egg. The sauce lacked flavor.
5	This is one excellent Ethiopian restaurant, rivals anything I've sampled in Washington DC or Seattle.  If I lived in Phoenix, this would be a Top-5 restaurant for me (along with Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles - yum!).Lalibela takes a slightly different approach to their menu.  Many of the entrees are offered as small portions ($4.50-$6.00 each).  They suggest each diner order 2-3 of these to make a meal. Kitfo and Lamb Tibs dishes are offered as full entrees and like many Ethiopian restaurants, you can order combo plates (meat combo, veggie combo, house combo plate etc.).  This made deciding on our meal a little more complicated, but also offered more flexibility for sampling different dishes.Our favorite dish ordered was the Lamb Tibs (the spicy version with Awaze spice paste).  Lamb was soooo tender, and the spices were a delight - rich in flavor but not too hot for those with tame palettes.  Good thing it comes as a full order - four of us were competing for bites!!  We ordered a half portion of Keye Wott (beef in a spicy brown sauce) that was some of the best I've ever had.  Again, rich in flavor but not too spicy.  My favorite Ethiopian meat dish is Kitfo - choice beef sort of like steak tartar (servered raw or lightly cooked) but with Ethiopian spices.  Lalibela's was pretty good, just not transcendent like the Lamb Tibs or Beef Keye Wott.  The vegetable dishes were on a whole excellent - especially the yellow lentils, gomen (collard greens) and spicy (Wott) lentils.Staff was great - attentive, helpful service.  Unlike some Ethiopian restaurants, this one is very user-friendly.  Although in some cases  the menu accommodates American tastes it doesn't compromise on quality or authenticity.  One note on the injera (sponge-like bread used to scoop up the entrees) - it's a mix of wheat flour and teff (a grain indigenous to Ethiopia) and I don't think it's fermented like injera that is made with 100% teff.  I'm used to the latter, but you can argue Lalibela's injera doesn't compete with the flavor of the entrees as much.All in all, one of the best Ethiopian restaurants I've been to, and I have been to many in the States.  Only problem now is whether my favorite Ethiopian restaurants in Seattle will still taste as good!  Highly, highly recommended.
4	I only have 1 wishes.....that I lived closer to Lalibela or that the'd open one closer to me.  I really enjoy their food.  It is flavorful and the price is great.  I always get the spicy combo, mild combo, collard greens and string beans and carrots.  Its plenty of food for 3 and super cheap, especially at lunch.  The injara (spongy sourdough pancake like bread you eat the food with) is delicious and high in protein.  They have really great desserts too.  Most definitely worth a trek if you don't live near by.  And if you do live close, I'm jealous.
4	Lalibela has the best Ethopian food around. The flavors are all amazing and everything --veggies and meat alike-- is stewed to perfection. I would recommend the "Lalibela Exclusive" or one of the other samplers. If you don't eat red meat, just ask them to substitute those portions with their favorite alternative. Try on the Ethopian teas or the delicious stout with your meal. The staff is also incredibly friendly and of course, everyone loves to eat with their hands, right?
4	This is very delicious, but the blue nile up the street is my favorite ethiopian.  I recommend everything but the lamb. I really like their doro wat, too. the shuro wat and collard greens. its very good.
4	Whenever I travel, I like to find an Ethiopian restaurant. It's usually in a part of town one wouldn't experience whilst staying in the business district. And it's usually an eatery, run by a husband and wife team, that's friendly to solo eaters, as I sometimes am.On top of all that, Ethiopian food is HONEST--it's meat and veggies in straight-up yummy sauces, good for your body and mind!Here in Tempe, Lalibela is a good example of that down-home mom-and-pop cooking, Eth-style.It's also a great spot to bring your friends and family. When you do, try the sampler platters; they're the best way to eat Ethiopian, emphasizing the communal nature of the feast (eaten with hands, not flatware).The teas are delicious too.
4	To consume what Lalibela's has to offer is essential to a proper functioning system. It's good for you. It's also great not to fret over utensils, and rather... use those fingers. GREAT!
4	I'm salivating thinking about the Lalibela Exclusive - the sampler plate for three. My friends and I ordered it and our pants were bursting at the seams when we were done! And we still hadn't cleaned house! I definitely recommend.
4	Granted, this restaurant has been my sole exposure to Ethiopian food, but it is _so_ good. For around $15-19 you can get an _enormous_ tray full of 10 or so different veggie and lamb/beef dishes,  all on a bed of sour injeera bread. Great for sharing between 4-5 people, with extra bread on the side. As long as your dining company doesn't mind eating "with their hands," you'll have a delicious, fun meal. Good thirst-quenching drinks too. Last time I was there, I wanted to try their "voted best in the valley" tiramisu for dessert, but they were out. :( Attentive service, still.
5	Don't be intimidated by this cuisine, it's excellent. Word of advice: go when you feel you're on the verge of dying from starvation. It's extremely filling and the portions are rather large. It's a great vegetarian option, as the veggie side of the menu eclipses the meat section. Some foods are mildly spiced, though the dishes are largely savory. Unfortunately, I can't remember the names of any of the dishes, minus the bread, injera, and the generic name for the dishes, wat. Injera is spongy in texture and the taste is reminiscent of sourdough, the wat dishes are essentially really thick stews that don't require a bowl. My personal favorite dish is the cabbage/carrot mixture. Don't worry that you don't see dinnerware, the server didn't forget. Instead, you tear off pieces of injera and pinch pieces of wat. On top of the basket of injera you'll get on the side, your food will be served on a large piece of it. This place is definitely a destination restaurant on Tempe's "restaurant row" between Priest and McClintock on University.
4	Cafe Lalibela is the best (of a total of two) Ethiopian restuarants here in the Valley. Tina's closed before I could get there, but Lalibela's food is on target.As a vegetarian, I can only review those foods, but the veggie wats are flavorful, spiced right and completely filling. The lentil wats are delicious, and the lunch sampler earns you three different wats (servings of various dishes). The injera is really good here, and you must ask for more if you eat forkless, as Ethiopians do. The waitstaff is very friendly, and attentive. They're always smiling and patient, and I got to know them a bit when I worked in Tempe.For lunch, get the (I'm giving my favorite secret away) spiced iced tea. They'll brew it for you cold, and it's a refreshing, herbal way to complete your lunch at Lalibela. For dinner, I prefer their Ethopian beer, which is one of the better Middle East/African beers I have had (blanking on the name).Take friends or family here, and share a giant platter together. Get your hands dirty, sop up some wat with your injera, and have an experience here.
4	FIVE MEATS!  That beats our family staple of three per meal.  Oh, I guess you could get that by ordering a meat lovers pizza which would be served similarly on a round piece of dough, but you wouldn't be living on the edge - come on, real Ethiopian food served by Iman look-alikes!   Okay, it was only four different meats, chicken, fish, lamb, and two beef stews, but each was uniquely flavored - could have used some indicators about which was which - didn't really matter, we made it, the chick peas, lentils, and collard greens disappear so fast that names are meaningless.  Maybe the image of lean people ekeing out any type of sustenance from the land made our hands move from the communal platter to our mouths in a continuous rhythm while the food was plentiful.  That was my first experience with African food and the spongy sour crepe-like injera bread, and I can't wait to introduce the kids to finger eating!
4	This was my first foray into Ethiopian food and I was impressed.  It's a cross between Indian and Morroccan, with the wonderful addition of injera.  I loved the family style, non-utensil, get your fingers dirty style.  I had some definite favorites, but without labels on the 15 items I tried, I have no idea what my favorites were).  Looking forward to going back for more.
4	Yum! This place hit the spot last night. I had dinner plans with a friend and we were both craving something flavorful as usual, and also wanted to go somewhere we haven't been. Scared of encountering yet another lackluster Thai restaurant we decided to try Cafe Lalibela and convinced two other friends to go with us. I haven't had Ethiopian in awhile and it was like experiencing it all over again. The inside was small and quaint... and packed! However, after being told we'd have a 20 minute wait, we only had about 7, which was great because the smell in the place was exquisite and was starting to make my stomach sing. The four of us ordered the Lalibela Exclusive with the addition of an order of the Asa Wat, which was fish. I had a glass of Ethiopian honey wine to go with it. It was incredible. I was so glad we added the fish because that was by far my favorite, followed by the spicy beef. The cabbage and potatoes was pretty delicious too, though I didn't really find one thing I didn't care for. It was very flavorful and the injera was the perfect addition. The wine was great also. The service was pretty slow, which became an issue with us wanting to hit up sweet republic after and we had to hunt down our check ourselves. It wasn't enough that I wouldn't go back again though. And again. And again.
5	Cafe Lalibela is fantastic.  I love eating there because the food comes super quick and it tastes delicious.  It's healthy, tasty and fills you up for a long, long time.I am, in no way, an authority on what makes for good Ethiopian food but I know what I likes, and this place I definitely likes.  I dig the atmosphere and the music that's always playing that totally makes me think of a smooth jazz station in Africa or something.  Yesterday I went and got some grub here.  The food came quick as usual and it tasted extraordinary, as usual.  But, man, there were these damn kids running around.  These people sitting across from us must've brought like 8 goddamn kids with them.  Somewhere between 8 and 10 totally bad kids that ran around and were loud and singlehandedly gave me an aching headache.  If I wasn't a pussy, I would have told them that they're selfish, yuppie fuckheads.  What are you thinking bringing that many kids to a place without a ball-pit?  Kids don't wanna eat at a quiet restaurant, they want to jump around and swing around and shit before totally passing out somewhere.  That's what kids do.  I don't blame the kids for being bored... I'd do the same shit.  I blame the parents for being such retarded, wanna-be cultured fucks.  "We'll bring our sophisticated children to get African cuisine.  Mmmmyeessss.... that's what I plan to do with my afternoon."There's not much the dude who works there could have done, unfortunately.  I mean, people who let their kids act like assholes would freak out if he told them that the kids were maddeningly loud.  They'd be like, "We're not paying the bill, shall never come back and will tell people there are rats in the food.  Whole rats.  No, it doesn't make sense but it's gross."Aside from that one incident, the place is great.  I love it.  I don't eat here as often as I'd like.  Something tells me that with the monster gas this place gives me, I'd be super healthy and would benefit from hitting 'em up on the montly.Fantastic-O.  Five stars.
4	Lalibela is my favorite lunch stop in Tempe. It is a great place to go to grab a quick $10 lunch with a friend. The service isn't the greatest, but because of the nature of Ethiopian food (everything is a stew) the dishes are delivered promptly. The only word of warning I have is to not get stuck in the back corner, as the server tends to forget the people back there. I always get the 4-6-8 for lunch, which consists of:Misir wat (Red lentils with a little bit of heat, although the level of "hot" can tend to vary from day to day)Tikil gomen (A delicious potato, carrot, and cabbage combo)Azifah (Cold lentils, with a bit of jalapeno for flavor)The Injera (bread, which doubles as your eating utensil) is perfect and spongy. Note: Don't order the "half and half" with rice and a half injera, instead get the full injera so you don't need to use a fork. If you want a fun, quick business lunch in Tempe, go to Lalibela
5	Lalibela is definitely an establishment for food connoisseurs; so if you unfortunately happen to be a good ol' fashioned American (gosh darn it!), requiring your plate of food super-saturated with salt, submerged in boiling lard, priorly frozen, served in a bag, or lacking any sort of flavor other than greasy; then this is not the place for you: for all others, a must. WE recommend getting one of the three-combination plates (the vegetarian or the MEAT are both excellent) during lunch hours, only $7.99; and it comes with a free fountain drink. Plus, you must try Injera (Ethiopian flat bread). Also as a side note, their Ethiopian beer is surprisingly quite tasty; and it pairs well with the food. What will it taste like may you ask? Think of this, imagine for a second that if it was at all possible for a plate of delicious Indian cuisine to somehow mange reproduction with a full-of-flavor-and-spice plate of Persian cuisine with the ending result a sexy Ethiopian platter of food baby. And there it is--in your mouth.
4	Went for the first time today with my sister for lunch. Small and quaint restaurant. Service was fast and efficient. I had never had Ethiopian food before, and had been putting it off because honestly, it just didn't *sound* like something I would eat. boy I was wrong- it was very good! Flavorful, and just filling enough without making you feel stuffed. I wasn't sure how spicy it would be, so I ordered the mild beef. It wasn't spicy at all, so I know that next time (and yes, there will be a next time) I will be braver in my ordering. :-)
1	Wow, I do not get why so many people like this place unless they like it because it is ethnic and different.I went with a group of friends, some of whom are vegetarian. We had 3 children with us. It is in a strip mall on University. It has very basic decorating. The owner was our waiter, his wife was in the restaurant and so was his child who ran around the whole time.We ordered 2 of the large assortment platters where you get a scoop of everything. We ordered injera bread and various drinks. I frankly felt overcharged for scoops of food that were CLEARLY not freshly prepared but froma steam table. Who knows when it was prepared! Sorry if you do not agree but food from a steam table is not worhty of the price they charge. I will not go back again. This is not the first Ethiopian restaurant we have been to and not the best.
4	Dinner for two on a Friday night at 6:45 with no wait!  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  I had the hot coffee leaf tea (or something like that) which was good, much like a traditional black tea, not too strong.  My friend tried the honey wine, which she liked.  It tasted much like mead I've had in the past, sweet with a good kick of alcohol.  We got the chef's favorite and vegetable sample plates, everything on it was good.  I'm not sure what the cheese like stuff is, it was a bit bland, but I guess it was probably meant to be sprinkled over the salad.  Lalibela's will be thrown into my rotation when I'm feeling like something a little different.
4	Took some friends here the other night, following the Tempe Oktoberfest, and had the big platter (plenty for four of us).  It was tasty, as always, and I think the newbies enjoyed it as well.  For those concerned about trying this cuisine for the first time, just imagine that it's like Italian meets Indian food.  At least that worked for us.  Definitely check this out.
4	We went with other CS in our culinary tour. They were kind to sit all of us (more than 20 persons). Good service, and the ladies were patient to take our order. We had the party trays, which says it is for 3, but it was good for 5 average persons. You get to try more than 4 different things and be satisfied. It is all about trying...and this is a good place to start!
3	Definitely worth a visit. A lot like Efes in food style. I wish the bread was more pita-esque. Personal preference of mine. A little disconcerting at the bottom of the plate when everyone's bare-knuckling it into the grub.
4	I love it. I mean, I LOVE doro wat. Always have. I have been looking for good Ethiopian food ever since I left Los Angeles and I almost feel like a jerk for saying Lalibela is not the best I've ever had, but it is a close second. Besides, Ethiopian food happens to be my favorite so you really can't give me anything in any Ethiopian restaurant that I'm not going to inhale. The best part about this place is that you can order a single-serve plate. Meaning, if you are a party of two (which we were), you are not forced to order one huge plate meant for three or four and share it by reaching across the table at each other. My date, Uncle S.P., ordered the same dish as I (chicken, beef, lentils, salad) and I added a glass of what I think is a pretty good Pinot Noir for $5! The two of us left there stuffed to the gills for around $40. I could have used more spice (as in heat); maybe I'll ask for that next time. The injera is really good, too - good, fluffy texture that just melts in your mouth.
5	Best vegetarian resteraunt in the valley. You will not find anything better. A++Dont let the name ethiopian get in the way. Try it for yourself.
4	This place used to be a favorite lunch spot of mine when I was living nearby! It was always so tasty, colorful and fun! The service was always pretty good! My only complaint is that my belly was always quick fill to up with injera... that stuff is intense and soaks up everything. I think there's still some down in my stomach lingering from last year.
4	I was encouraged to join my Aunt and Mother at this restaurant for some traditional Ethiopian food.  My Aunt is from Dallas, and works with some Ethiopians and said that the food was great.  Had a ton of flavor and was something different.  I was completely out of my comfort zone, but I said "what the hell?" and went along for the ride.I certainly am glad that I did. I have been back several times.  We had one of the traditional combination meals to be shared by the three of us.  It was great.  For those like myself who have never eaten Ethiopian food before, here is a little run down of what goes on.  First, you order as a group and their serve your platter family style.  They give you some injera, which is like a pita or tortilla that you use to then pinch your food as you eat bite by bite.  The injera is somewhat gummy, and has an unusual texture which definitely takes getting used to.  If you visualize grabbing some hummus with a piece of pita bread, that is what you are doing when eating your food.  It's more of a pinch than a scoop, but I think you catch my drift.  The different food that they place on the platter is called Wat.  My favorite was the doro wat.  The coffee was excellent as well at Lalibela.The restaurant itself is nothing too spectacular, but it didn't bother me.  It was extremely clean, and you could tell that care was put into everything about the restaurant.  The staff was very helpful, and showed pride for their product and their country.  I look forward to coming back again.
5	I was lucky enough to get to dine at two Ethiopian places during my last week in Phoenix.  After Blue Nile, I was dying to experience Lalibela and get another taste of Ethiopian food.I came here during lunch, and I have to say their specials were awesome.  $7.99 for your choice of 3 options of meat or vegetarian, injera or rice, and a drink.  Pretty good deal if I do say so myself.I settled on the veggie options of the two lentil dishes and the green beans and carrots with injera.  My guy got the three meat dishes and injera.The food came quickly, and I have to say these portions are much bigger than Blue Nile.  And I think these might be a bit tastier.  I loved the spicy lentils and the beans and carrots.  And the sauces in my guy's meat dishes were equally amazing.Now that I've popped my Ethiopian cherry, I'm determined to learn how to cook some damn good Ethiopian food.  I doubt it can match this place, but I'm not going to be finding Ethiopian in Salem and I need my fix!
4	Right across the street from two Tempe favorites, Cornish Pasty Co., and Cheba Hut, Lalibela completes a triangle of great Tempe spots.This restuarant is better than Blue Nile in every way. It's nicer, the food is better, the portions are larger, and the service is nicer.The prices are very reasonable too, and their sourdough like bread is tremendous.
4	Finally got to go here again for my 2nd time after a long wait from the 1st time.  I enjoy this place, it is very different that almost anywhere else we go both in food and atmosphere.  The lunch special is very affordable and gives you a chance to try 3 different foods.
4	I had Ethiopian food for the first time in Solvang, CA and fell in love. I tend to like tangy food and boy did this cuisine deliver. Rich, savory, tangy flavors.. *Drools*This place has delicious, authentic, affordable food and good service. The only thing lacking is the environment. The setting is a bit boring and dated.
4	I took my girlfriend to Cafe Lalibela for Valentine's Day, because no Hallmark holiday would be complete without injera and spicy lentils. She was an Ethiopian neophyte and also has a spice disability, so she ordered the mild beef stew, collard greens and the homemade cheese, which was similar to feta, but milder and not as salty. I ordered the Vegetarian combo: collard greens, the cabbage and carrots, green salad and lentils. The novelty of using an neatly rolled spongy napkin as a utensil makes me blissfully content and causes a childlike glee at subverting the norm. The did not have honey wine, which was a disappointment, but we did order the hot tea with cardamon, cinnamon and other treats. The portions were more than filling, although the garlic in the collard greens would cause the entire cast of Twilight to run for the hills. Overall, it was a lovely meal and I would give it two food stained thumbs up.
4	I had been waiting for my extra weekly cheat meal to try this place. I finally got sick of waiting and went for my Sat night feast. I have regrets.. regrets that I didn't go sooner!This was absolutely delicious. I went with two other people and we ordered the "Lalibela Exclusive." This is primarily a combination of their meat dishes with a few of the vegetable options. Sadly I wont be able to review in detail as I usually do because there was so much on the plate I could not remember what exactly was what. There was nothing on that combination that I didn't like. There were a few things I liked more then others but everything was tasty.I don't think I would recommend this place for a "first date" but would be a fun night out for an established relationship. The whole messy, eating with your hands, making a big mess, just doesn't seem like the best first impression material ;)What I have found sucks the most about trying all of these new places is that I want to go back right away and cant :( I felt this way about both Lalibela and Los Compadres.. But the list of places to try is big and I'm having a GREAT time doing it.injera:This is your fork for dinner. Its a light airy tortilla/pancake like bread made of teff flour. Pretty sure this stuff expands in the stomach because we were all surprised how full we got and how quickly.Pros:Great combination pricing. Three of us walked away stuffed, having tried nearly 3/4 of their menu for about $15 including tip.Plenty of seating even for a busy Saturday night.Very sweet wait staff.Cons:Kitchen/Service is a little slowCommunal eating is fun but easy to spread germs. Make sure everyone is healthy and with freshly washed hands :)Pretty sure my hands will smell delicious for a few days.
5	I've lived in this part of Tempe for years and years and have driven/biked/walked past Cafe Lalibela at least a million times. I knew nothing about Ethiopia or Ethiopian cuisine and even though I love trying new places, this was never on my list. What a fool I was. I loved the smell in the restaurant. I'm not sure if it was curry, but that's what it reminded me of. The menu taught me new words like Wat and Injera. So not only did I leave feeling satisfied with a delicious meal, but I'm smarter now too! Hooray!You eat with your hands, which kinda weirded me out, but then I got into it. I split the meat platter and a bowl of the lentil/tomato soup with another person and it was more than enough for both of us. The meats were spicy and flavorful and the thin, spongy sourdough bread was divine. They have been in business for about 15 years, so go them!! They are not just doing something right, they are doing everything right. Cafe Lalibela is a triumph and Tempe is a better city because of this restaurant.
4	My first Ethiopian experience in AZ.  Jared's first Ethiopian experience ever!  Friday night - no food in the house - I throw around ideas of places to go, Jared nixes them... this is how the evening started.  But somehow I convinced him to get in the car and head towards Tempe.  I knew there were some Ethiopian joints, and I somehow convinced him to try Lalibela!  We both really enjoyed it!Mona was our waitress... and she suggested we share the #16 (Meat Combination) and #17 (Vegetable Combination) to give us a variety of dishes.  That would've been plenty, but I also wanted to try the #10 (Shiro Wat / Ground Peas), so we had that too... oh and since Jared was starving, he ordered a Shorba (Lentil Soup) to start.  The soup was just ok, but the food was delicious!  We loved the injera (Ethiopian Bread).  and used it to eat the variety of dishes served on a big platter.  Our favorites were the Gomen (collard greens), Fosolia (string beans and carrots), and Key Sega Wat (spicy beef stew), but literally everything was good... we were stuffed after almost cleaning the platter!I have some friends that have more adventurous palates (ahem, Colleen C), so I look forward to sharing more Ethiopian meals with them at Lalibela in the future!And one last thing:  for anyone questioning Ethiopian eating etiquette, it says on the front of the menu that "traditional Ethiopian etiquette disapproves of licking fingers while eating (even though it may be tempting to do so).  I hope that anyone that shares future meals with me at Cafe Lalibela will adhere to this too.
3	This is not the most authentic Ethiopian food, but it is one of the better ones in AZ. The food was full of flavor and spice. The sour injera (spongy bread) with alicha sega wat (beef stew) is delicius. I also enjoy getting the combos which includes three different stews. It's a great way to find out what you like.
5	I've heard all the jokes..."Ethiopian food? I thought they didn't have food in Ethiopia?" Hilarious. Now go and try this place!It's basically piles of meats (Wat) or veggies cooked slowly with lots of flavors and served on Injera, a sourdough-tasting spongy bread that resembles a large crepe. You tear off pieces and scoop up the forms of Wat or veggies. I cannot pick a favorite of the meats, although the Alicha Sega Wat is very good. I love the Misir Wat (lentils) and Gomen (collard greens - very garlic-y).Save room for dessert. A little known fact, but they have some of the Valley's best Tiramisu. I happen to love their Tres Leches cake also. A smooth sweet finish to an otherwise spice-filled meal.
3	I reeeeaaalllyyyyy wish that I could give this a 4, but I can't do that in good conscience.  The food was great, but the service was downright abysmal.In a fit of random adventurousness, I thought it would be fun to try a new kind of food for me.  I'm typically a weenie and afraid of anything "weird" so this is a big deal for me.  We drove out here on Friday night and at around 6 or so the restaurant was about half full.  We stood at the door for entirely too long while we waited to be seated.  When we were at our table, we waited entirely too long to get menus.  When we knew what we wanted, we waited entirely too long to place our order.  You get the idea.  Thankfully the food came out fairly quickly.  I ordered the vegetarian plate that had collard greens, some kind of cabbage/carrot/potato thing, red lentils, and some bean/carrot/onion thing.  As with all dishes, it was served with the injera, a weird sourdough crepe thing.  I was a little weirded out that the bread thing was served cold, but I got used to it quickly enough.  Everything on my plate was yummy, but if I were to rank it, my favorite would be the lentils, followed by the collard greens, then the potato, then the carrot/bean thing.  Eating here was a fun experience for sure, and not having any silverware definitely made for some creative feeding procedures.  I would probably come back here if the mood for Ethiopian food struck me again, but I would really hope that the service would be better.  Since everyone else mentions great service, I am going to assume we came at an "off" time.
4	I'm going to be more forgiving of the service than my wife was.  This place has some awesome food and it comes out pretty quick too.  Yes, it took forever to get the waitress to come over but once she did, we had our food in about 5 minutes.I really wish I knew what I was eating.  It was the "Chef's Favorite Combination" which was chicken, collard greens, and something called ayeb which was cheese of some sort.  The whole thing comes on some weird flat bread.  It was really good.  I would go back, without a doubt.
4	The food is consistently phenomenal here.  There are plenty of vegetarian options (meat as well) and all the vegetarian food is also vegan. It is a family-owned place I think, and cozy. At least one of the servers seems totally depressed to be there. I think she resents it when you need something -- my main reason for only 4 stars. We just love eating here! I definitely recommend it if you're not afraid to stray from American meat + potatoes.
5	Ethiopian is so tasty, especially at Lalibela. Blue Nile is good but Lalibela is better taste-wise. Great prices too.
5	LOVE LOVE LOVEA slight bit short on atmosphere, but who cares when the food is that good? I could eat here every day.
4	Sooooo, there's a lot on my mind.  The economy is in terrible condition.  We're being labeled as racists, we're still mired in multiple wars, I really want the Heat to suck this year but am afraid they won't, I think I'm gaining weight, losing my hair, and I am certain that my right foot is bigger than my left.But you know the worst thing about my life right now?No meat.  If only I was talking about the musical group, but alas.  My father passed away last week so to respect Buddhist beliefs, no meat for 49 days.  So what is a bacon guzzling, sausage stuffing ( shame on you for having a dirty mind!), carnivorous soul going to do?Eat at Lalibela Cafe of course!  Walking in, I was a little wary of the $50 authentic Ethiopian attire in a basket as you walk in.  Better not be a tourist trap, I am thinking.  Continuing to look around, it felt a little cluttered but not too much so, with some interesting art and more clothing on the walls to peruse.  I was running a little behind on time as I had originally intended to go to Byblos which was closed for renovations until August 20th, so I cut short my examination of the decor to order.  I ordered the Vegetarian Sampler (7.99), which is your choice of 3 out of 5 dishes to go along with the injera or rice.  I also had the Yekemem Shai (2.50) black tea with cinnamon, cardamom & cloves cold, which was a refreshing drink. The Masir Wat, red split lentils simmered in hot sauce and herbs, was delicious and made me not miss meat so much, with a texture reminiscent of ground beef and a spicy flavor that was subtle but satisfying.  Tikil gomen, lightly spiced cabbage, carrots and potatoes was also a winner, with an almost buttery finish.  Gomen, chopped collard greens cooked with garlic and onions was the only component that was merely okay, with the flavors being a little too mild for my taste, but by no means bad.  The injera itself was a quiet partner in the backdrop of all these flavors, slightly sour and spongy.While no one checked in on my meal, no one had to, as I was quite pleased and didn't need a refill.  The initial service was fast and efficient as well, even with only 2 on the waitstaff and about 15 people coming in right around when I did.So you know what?  Our economy is going to recover.  I might be a little racist but who isn't?   Wars are just disagreements taken too far, Lebron will remain crownless, I'm just big-boned, there's always Rogaine or a toupee, and I can always get custom shoes where the right is bigger than the left, and I have Lalibela Cafe to thank for putting me in this frame of mind.Thanks for a great lunch, and I'll be back often, meat or no meat!
5	Ethiopian cuisine at it's best; Cafe Lalibela is the alpha while that other Ethiopian restaurant in Tempe, which shall remain nameless, is the obvious beta. Every experience i have had here has been first rate. Not once have i been let down or treated poorly; whether i was on my best behaviour mimicking an upright citizen square or fried out of my mind on mushrooms draped in paisley- the lovely ladies at Lalibela serve me luscious mouth-watering ethnic delicacies regardless of my pupil's dilations or contractions.Your first encounter with Ethiopian cuisine could be intimidating for the casual newb, but your curiosity will serve you well! I had no clue what to order when i first came here, so i asked my server and she steered me in the right direction.If i remember correctly, my first time consisted of Doro Wat, collared greens and a heavily spiced wat mixture of cabbage, carrots and onion. Since, i have tried nearly everything on the menu save the fish wat, whose name escapes me, and every item has been so delictable! You really can't go wrong when you can order a meal for two for under $15 and still have left overs for the both of you. Cafe Lalibela is a students dream! Cheap prices, exotic flavours, quiet unrushed atmosphere, perfect for a long study/homework session and a grande meal to take the edge off.I love you Lalibela and I only hope we have many more happy years together!
5	My first experience with Ethiopian food! I was hesitant, as it is a cuisine I knew little-to-nothing about, but holy moly - I was so surprised. Four girlfriends and I ordered the vegetarian exclusive (I believe it's called) which is meant for three people, so we also ordered the vegetarian platter meant for one. We hardly finished the exclusive, there was so much food! Everything is SO tasty. I was worried about the injera, as I have friends who don't like the consistency of it. I really loved the fresh sourdough taste of it, though, especially mixed with the flavors of the different wats. After my first visit, I was so excited to take my boyfriend there - we made dinner plans with friends of ours within two weeks of my first trip! I absolutely LOVE Lalibela and it is quickly becoming one of my favorite stops for delicious vegetarian food!
3	This was my second try at Ethiopian food in a week.  Wasn't quite as impressed with the dining experience as many though still a great place if you are ever wanting to at least try Ethiopian for your first time.I ordered the ethnic stout and my partner in crime had the tea.  The stout was a few hops away from being an IPA, a little too much for me but the tea was very delicious after it cooled down from its molten plasma form to a more drinkable liquid.  We ordered the spicy combination along with the goat selection and brown lentils.  I'm a spicaholic and the berbere definitely gave each of the dishes a nice kick.  The beef dish was cubed just right for picking up in bite sized morsels but the chicken needed to get handled with with hands to tear pieces away.  The injera was really sticky and not quite dried out yet which is where the problems were later in the meal.  After you get about halfway through your meal by scooping it up with the injera provided in the basket the rest is usually able to be eaten with the layer of injera below your food selections.  Because it was already so moist the moisture from the food completely disintegrated the injera as I tried to pick it up.  I had to order another basket of fresh injera in order to clean up the plate.  In conclusion, great food but I definitely recommend ordering a second helping of injera right off the bat if you are ordering a platter for two or more people.
4	Lalibela was my first real foray into Ethiopian food. I hadn't ever had a full meal of Ethiopian food but I had tried it off of friend's plates when they had picked some up. I had really liked it and always wanted to order it but I just never got around to it. Recently, I noticed Lalibela while getting food from another restaurant nearby and decided to try it. I ordered the Spicy Combination, which comes with doro wat, kye sega wat, and misir wat. I love spicy food and this was perfect. It was not so spicy that you couldn't taste the food but exactly spicy enough to satisfy my constant spicy craving. The chicken and beef in the doro wat and kye sega wat, respectively, were super tender and delicious. The misir wat was great as well, and had a perfect blend of herbs and spices in the sauce. The injera was plentiful, they really give you a large portion. It was very soft and tasty. Food came out really fast too which was nice. All in all I had a really great experience with Ethiopian food from Lalibela and will be going back there for more!
5	When it comes to traditional Ethiopian fare, this joint can't be beat in the valley.  My favs?  The Shorba Soup (a vegetarian take on the traditional Shorba) and the Misir Wat (a spiced red lentil dish).  And while it's not Ethiopian, the Tiramasu is a must-have!
5	I love this place!!!We had previously been fans of a place in Tucson, and were a bit weary of trying a new place, having heard negative feedback from friends who ate at a Phoenix location.Hopeing this was not that location, we decided to try it!It is a small diner like location tucked into a corner shopping plaza. It was not fancy, but had great authentic decor. It was clear immediately that this was a family owned place, which to me, typically means better, more authentic eating. I was right!We were quickly seated and the waitress was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the meat combo, some mild lamb,  and a spicy split pea dish.When the waitress delivered our meal ( about 2 minutes after ordering) it was in fact the veggie combo, not so good for my husband, Captain Carnivore. She noticed this immediately, and not only brought us what we originally ordered, but let us keep the veggie platter free of charge! This made for a lot of food, but gave us the chance to try a bit of everything.The food was awesome! My favorite part of Ethiopian food has always been the aspect of dining as a community of friends, as opposed to selfishly hoarding your individual plate, bragging to others of your current experience, maybe allowing a taste to your friends. These dishes are brought out combined on a platter on a spread of special bread, which you use instead of utensils to eat your food, free for all in your party to experience!Our favorites were the spicy beef, spicy chicken, mild lamb, and spicy split pea lentil concoction.We left full, and happy, with a box full of leftovers to enjoy tomorrow!!No more having to wait for those long trips to Tucson!Eat Here!!!
4	love it, go whenever I'm in the tempe area and get a chance.
5	IT'S VERY NON THREATENING, even a fussy eater will love it.   I have been eating here since 1997. It was half the size back then.  They did very well and needed more space and took over Rasta-Tangs spot next door and expanded the restaurant to double it's capacity.  Since then waiting for a table is rare. The food is amazing. The Ethiopian HONEY wine is available to buy by the bottle.  I buy it and guests at my home are always impressed. After running 10 miles in the morning I like to go here to get my Injeera (pancake bread) carbo stores back up. The meats you can pick from are all great.  I always ask for extra Injeera, can't get enough of it :) I have been to the other similar restaurant in Tempe.  No comparison.  I tried it twice to make sure.. it wasn't even close. Lunch specials come with a drink and are served very quickly for those on  a lunch break.
4	Went last night as a group of four adults and one picky toddler.  I had tried Ethiopian (only as takeout) a few months ago and due to being preggers could only enjoy it briefly before the smell overwhelmed me. My friend had tried it years ago and did not like it and both our husbands had never tried Ethiopian cuisine.  I'll cut to the chase...we all really enjoyed our meals! Even my toddler mastered the art of using the injera bread to scoop up yummy food.Unsure of whether we would like the food or not hubby and I opted to share an individal platter, figuring our kid would only pick at the food at best.  We went with the Meat Combo, #16 I think, and it had doro wat, and two other wats (spicy and mild beef stews).  I added gomen, which are the greens, because I do remember those being very tasty from my previous try.  I LOVED the Doro Wat and Gomen! It was a lot of food for us--even with my daugter eating a good amount of it--and we ended up taking home leftovers. Our friends both ordered separate individual platters and had waaaaay too much food left over. We finished off our meal with the chocolate mousse cake which was delicious.  Our meal (platter and dessert) was just under $30.  The place is nothing to look at--no frills at all, but that was not what we expected anyway.  The only thing I would have enjoyed more was if our injera bread had been served warm.  Otherwise, we all had a really good time and enjoyed our meals. Definitely will return.
4	I had the mild platter, with the mild beef, lamb and some sort of veggie dish. The flavors were excellent, and all melded well together. It went very well with the light Ethiopian beer. I was interested in trying an Ethiopian dessert, but they didn't have any that night. Very fast service without being pushy.
4	I had a really good experience here with the vegetarian dishes. Ethiopian Cuisine is by far my favorite and I try to eat it wherever I travel. This restaurant did not let me down. Don't be afraid, if it's your first time just dive right in. Injeera bread can seem foreign to those not familiar with the food, but it's incredibly good and good for you! Most dishes are stewed, some are spicy. Lentils, chick peas, greens and other vegetables are common and vegetarians should not have any trouble eating here.
3	I visited Lalibela for lunch and ordered the 3 item special with chicken, beef and red lentils.  The chicken and red lentils were great - moist and flavorful, and some of the best Ethiopian I've ever had.  The beef was good, but not as good as the chicken or lentils.I'm a little bit conflicted on how to rate the experience, because although the food was delicious during consumption, the aftereffect was a feeling similar to being repeatedly punched in the stomach.  As good as the food was, due to the heaviness, I probably won't be back.
3	Ok I'm somehow still surprised to find good food in the area but I think that's because I'm only ever a visitor.  I stumbled across this gem while looking for coffee.  There's a walkup or drive through (no inside seating) starbucks in the same strip mall.  The place looked nice enough inside I had work to do so I got some take out.Doro Wat is quite good though could always be spicier (I know that's a personal preference though).  Also I would have liked some hard boiled egg in the container.  It normally comes on the platter.  Lastly the Doro wat was a little oilier than I would have expected.The gomen (collard greens) is delicious- a little salty and buttery tasting with big pieces of garlic. The misir wat (red lentils) is also delicious.The injera is thin and delicate but doesn't have any of the hint of sour I remember from other places.  This is neither bad nor good - just an observation.in all I'd happily go back.  If on my next visit to the area I find they have honey wine I'll be upgrading the rating if only because it seems hard to find.One last negative: I found a long hair in the bottom which definitely does not belong to me and since my wife is in Chicago I have to think it belongs to someone I don't know.
4	For a taste of the exotic, the allure of eating without utensils, and a journey to Ethiopia...Lalibela is your dining destination.  Although this cozy restaurant is located in a strip mall in Tempe, the African art, woven baskets, and boxes of Harar in the hall (Ehtiopian Lager, which is delicious!) give you a small sense that you have stepped into another world.This illusion stays well preserved as you peruse the menu and realize you have never seen anything like it, starting with your inability to pronounce "Yekik Alicha" (split peas).But do not be daunted by this new territory.  Start your adventure to Ethiopia with the "Yekemem Shai," a black tea with cinnamon, cardamom & cloves.  If you are new to Ethiopian, and not sure what to get, the Lalibela Exclusive is the most fantastic combination of dishes you can sample.  Here, you will have a smattering of meat and vegetarian dishes ranging from "Yebeg Alicha Sega Wat" (lamb cubes simmered in kibae, onion, turmeric and herbs) to my personal fave, the "Yekik Alicha" (split peas cooked with onion, turmeric and herbs).Once the food arrives, the basket of "injera" (bread closely resembling a crepe) will become your eating utensils.  Don't be shy, tear off a piece, and use it to scoop the delicious morsels off the plate and into your expectant mouth.  You will not be disappointed.  In fact, you may feel as though you have just stepped off University and into a traveling caravan in the Ethiopian desert.Whether you are a carniverous adventurer, or a vegetarian swashbuckler - you will enjoy the richness and flavors of this unique cuisine. Bring a large appetite, as the food is quite filling.  Dominant meats are beef, chicken and lamb.  Savory veggies to be enjoyed are lentils, peas, cabbages, and collard greens.For a lovely gustative to finish your meal, order a glass of the traditional Ethiopian sweet wine made from honey.Overall, from the service to the food, to the ambiance, an excellent place to bring friends, or a date ;)
4	We ended up here sort of by accident. We had a $25 gift certificate to use so we went on a double date with another couple. We got the biggest platter they had, that pretty much had a little bit of everything. Right this second, I couldn't even tell you what everything was, but I do know it was all amazing. the flavours were impeccable, and bold. Even the vegetarian dishes were flavourful and different. They don't give you silverware, instead you get a basket of the Ethiopian sourdough flatbread to pick the food up with. It's a very communal way to eat, and we loved it! Go with a group, it's a fun way to spend an evening. Go as a couple, it's an intimate way to eat, and using your fingers to eat has always been considered sexy. ;-) The staff is friendly, and the place filled up quick after we got there. If you want to try something new, try this place! We were VERY pleasantly surprised!
4	I have been eating Ethiopian food since my first experience in Washington DC in 1988 and it was a revelation. It's just so tasty and familiar ( the vegetarian dishes remind me of homemade cuban dishes- no surprise since one of the influences of Cuban cuisine is african spices ). We are lucky to have Cafe Lalibela in the valley as it's one of the best of it's kind. I have eaten Ethiopian in New York City, Detroit, Chicago, Paris, Toronto , LA and of course, Washington DC. The food is  totally delicious, and many of the vegetarian entrees are low calorie. I have tried some Ethiopian recipes at home but they just can't compare to their food. The service is ok, I wish the waitress that always serves us would smile more and make us feel more at home, but after a while you get used to it. We always have to ask for more injera because she never asks. I have tried The Blue Nile, which is good, but the food here is tastier. It can be a little pricey considering the amounts you get, but well worth it cause it's delicious. One on my favorite restaurants in the valley.
4	I found this little gem thanks to a friend's recommendation.  The Spicy Meat Combo plate wasn't terribly hot (medium heat at best), but savory and delicious.  While good, the injera was fairly mild and didn't have as strong of a yeasty tang that I typically expect.The iced black tea with chai spices ("Yekemem Shai") is a perfect accompaniment to the meal: the bright flavors provided a refreshing, palate-cleansing break between bites.
4	So I'm in the middle of a fast. It's vegan with even more restrictions. Needless to say my dining options are very limited. Lalibela seemed to be the perfect choice. The staff was so friendly and we were seated immediately. We ordered the Vegetarian Exclusive even though there was only two of us. The water tastes good here which is becoming harder to find. The food arrived quickly and tasted fabulous. The different lentil dishes were my favorite along with the yellow peas. The injera was very good. The restaurant was almost full but remained extremely quite. It is a very relaxing place to dine.
5	My boyfriend and I came here for an early dinner. Neither of us know much about Ethiopian food so we opted for the Lalibela Exclusive to share. It was a little more pricey but came with tons of food and choices. We dominated the entire meal and then shared a slice of tiramisu made homemade by our waiter. The service was great and the atmosphere authentic. We'll be coming back!
4	I had sworn off Ethiopian food after not liking the bread at my first Ethiopian restaurant. This place has reversed my view. I just ate here for a second time in a week. I have had the beef and chicken stew. I love how tender the meat is and the spices they use. I also like how they prepare their collard greens. Their homemade cheese was a pleasant surprise--not as salty as I expected. I was happily surprised by the bread. I was expecting something with the texture of a sponge or carpet--not that I know what either tastes like. Their bread is slightly sponge-y but closer to crepe wraps. The ladies that work the front are perfectly nice. It's funny to see a mom and pop place like this next to a Papa John's Pizza. I am now a fan of Ethiopian food.
5	My first Yelp EVER!   And Cafe Lalibela is most deserving to get my first Yelp.  I have been eating there since 2003. Back when I lived in Tempe, I wanted to try something different, and Ethiopian food was one thing that I had never tried before.  And in one sitting, Cafe Laibela made Ethiopian food my favorite ethnic choice.  I still stop in whenever I go to Tempe.   I highly recommend their lamb dish called Yebeg Alicha Wat, but if you are more of a beef person, then you'll like Kye Segwa Wat.   Try their Kootee tea too!
4	This place was wonderful. $7.99 for lunch. Quick service. Friendly staff. Great food.
4	A few weekends ago my sister and I decided to try Ethiopian cuisine.  Wanted to try something different so we went to Lalibela on a Sunday night.  The restaurant isn't fancy by any means.  I had no idea what the food was going to be like but we were pleasantly surprised.  The staff was very helpful especially in the menu choices.  We chose the veggie and meat combos respectively.  The only thing we weren't too fond of on the place was the collared greens.  Everything else was delicous.If you've never eaten Ethiopian before its a trip.  Instead of regular utensils there is a bread called injera which is kind a spongey flatbread.  Basically you scoop up what you want to eat with said bread.  They do serve beer did not try any, the chai tea was very tasty. Subdued and not too spicy.  The meals seem to be served family style for sharing which is perfect for small groups.  If you are willing to step outside the bounds of conventional dining you will definitely enjoy the experience.
4	i haven't been to many ethiopian restaurants, perhaps only two or three aside from lalibella....and maybe i'm just impartial to ethiopian food in general, because there's never been an ethiopian meal that i haven't enjoyed. the only reason i don't give it five stars, is that i've eaten at another ethiopian place that had a bit more flavor and variety on their menu, and was for those reasons unforgettable (it also had a buffet!). unfortunately, the name escapes me and unfortunately it's also almost a thousand miles away from where i now abide...i have never eaten (at any ethiopian place) anything other than vegetarian food. the red lentils at lalibela are particuarly good. even alone, they taste as satisfying as meat..the injera is very good too. anyone else i've ever taken here eats meat, and has ordered accordingly to their carnivorous tastes, and enjoyed what they ordered. (two people raved about the lamb).the only drawback, though it is no fault of lalibela, is that i can't understand how someone could eat this type of food often because it is so filling, but that might just be me.
4	Based on Yelp reviews, my husband and I have been enjoying Lalibela's delicious food for several years.  We calendar in a visit every time we travel to Phoenix.Haven't had a disappointing meal. The first time we ordered the sampler platter.  It was huge and provided a terrific array of their tasty vegetable and meat dishes.  My current favorite is the spicy beef and chicken with a side of green beans and carrots.  My husband loves the meat combination.  My descriptions don't do the dishes justice.  The spice and flavor combinations are so deliciously wonderful.Wish Lalibela's was closer to home.  We would eat there all the time.
4	I tried Cafe Lalibela (and Ethiopian food) for the first time recently with a friend. I got the Mild Combination: yebeg alicha sega wat (cubed lamb), alicha sega wat (cubed beef), and fosolia (string bean concoction). The lamb and beef were fairly interchangable as far as taste, but both were excellent cuts of meat and the sauce they were in was very tasty. The fosolia (string bean) was not to my liking, but I think this is a personal preference as my friend tried it and liked it. Something about the seasoning just wasn't my cup of tea.Speaking of tea, I also got a cup of Yekemem Shai (black tea with cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves). This not only smelled delicious, but it tasted fantastic. I normally sugar my tea, but I drank this one without sugar and it was all the better for it. I highly recommend this tea if you visit Cafe Lalibela!!Also, the waitress was friendly and helpful when choosing off the menu. I will be going back to this restaurant again! Good stuff.
4	I don't know why it took me so long to try Lalibela. Tucked away in a typical tempe strip mall, Lalibela had a decent crowd for 8:00 on a weeknight. And we found out why - the food here is superb. I ordered the vegetable combination and my parner-in-crime ordered the meat combination. His prefered the two beef dishes to the chicken. They are very generous with the inerja here.I LOVED the Tikil Gomen (cabbage) and the Gomen (collard greens), but all four of the dishes were wonderful. I also enjoyed the Misir Wat (lentils); my boyfriend said that the lentils were his favorite vegetarian item when he sampled all of my items. The Fosolia (string beans) was good, but I prefered the other items.Order their iced teas! We had the Tossign which was very refreshing and the Yekemem Shai - which is very similar to a Chai.
3	The food was excellent.  Everyone in our group raved about the flavor and quality.  However the service was simply awful.  The waitress clearly didn't care to be there, and we didn't get a single drink refill the entire time.  Not one.  Not even water.
4	I walked here for dinner, in order to enjoy the warm Phoenix air and the late sunset.  Having never tried Ethiopian food and having seen the ratings, I thought I'd give this a shot.Fortunately, I was preceded by an apparent regular who was introducing the restaurant to his out-of-town friends; I got some food recommendations and a peek at how to eat without utensils. I chose the meat combination; a combination of doro wat, kye sega wat and alicha sega wat, served with selata.  All of it was excellent.Service was fine, although not overly attentive.  I would have enjoyed more water, but there aren't many waiters or waitresses that keep up with my water needs.Food: 5Service: 4Setting: 3+ (not bad, but not particularly exciting, either).
3	My very first try of Ethiopian.Went at lunch hour.Selected menu items 3, 4, 5.  1 Meat and 2 Vegetarian.The food came out within a minute or 2 - so they must have some buffet line inside.The food kind of tastes like a underspiced indian food.  I almost wish the sauce was with GOAT or LAMB.The service was non-existant after the food trough drop off, so we just walked up and paid.I guess I didn't find Ethiopian food that remarkable - sorry . . .
4	Pretty good.  I've only had Ethiopian once before, but the food was delicious and delivered quickly (we ordered the staples, meat stews on spongy bread).  Reasonable prices also.  They had a log of vegetarian dishes I'd like to try in the future.
3	Not my kind of food but the vegetarian options are available.
3	Have gone to Lalibela a few times1) 1st time with my mother and wife.  The food was good.  We are all familiar with Ethiopian food.  Maybe the food was a bit Americanized, as we have eaten Ethiopian food elsewhere in the USA.  We got a standard vegetarian combo meal.2) I have taken a few of my work colleagues to this place, as I work nearby.  They were from Toronto, and others were from Italy.  For having never eaten Ethiopian food before, all were impressed.  They found the food good quality.  One of my colleagues called the food "yummy".
5	Mmmm I love this place. I've had Lalibela in my regular lunch rotation for years. The servers are great and they are quick to suggest dishes for new people. The atmosphere is nice and cozy and the food is divine. Some of my favorites: Kye sega wat  - Beef cubes simmered in spicy sauceMisir wat  - Red lentils simmered in hot sauce and herbs.Fosolia  - Lightly spiced string beans cooked with carrots and onion.Yebeg Alicha Sega Wat - Lamb cubes simmered in kibae, onion, turmeric and herbs.All this is servced with injera which is a spongy sour crepe, you use it to scoop the food off of the plate. The spices for each dish are powerful and unique, I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu. After writing this review I know what I am having for lunch today!
4	Mmmmmm I love this place. I've been coming here on a regular basis since 2007. Found this place because I was mad at my boss and was driving around and pulled in to try Essence Bakery and was distracted by the fact there was an Ethiopian restaurant in the same plaza. So I decided to try this place instead. So, so, so glad I did.(Regarding my first time) I walked in and immediately fell in love with aroma of the place. It was definitely tickling my senses. I ordered the doro wat (chicken) w/the traditional egg, misr wat (red lentils) and the fosolia (green beans and carrots in a tomato sauce). This was served with injera (looks like a crepe and tastes like a heavenly sourdough bread). To drink, I ordered the Yekmen tea, cold. Wow, talk about a drink to complement your food. This tea is fantastic.The food is very flavorful. The spices are well balanced. Their version of spicy/heat is pretty mild for my taste, but everyone has their opinions of this. I highly recommend getting the Yekemen/Yekmen chai, hot or cold, with your order. The spices in the tea complement the spices used in the food very well. This is coming from someone who always order water with her meals. This is probably the only place I order tea instead of water.I've heard some people complain about the service. Well, guess what, in Ethiopian culture, they usually don't check on you. This place does, sometimes slowly. I'm grateful for that. Understanding the culture, I don't complain about the service. I do recommend that if you are in a hurry, place your order to-go.Here's the one downfall. Their food is a little on the oily side. Wat is a type of thick stew and most of the wat recipes call for kibae, a type of butter. I thought at first that the oily part was going to be a problem for me, but after dining at Blue Nile, I discarded the notion. Blue Nile had almost none of this oil, but then again, they lack the flavor too. That's another review for later though. I'll take the flavor any day!I've since brought my mother, son, sister, friends, co-workers, clients and anyone I can think of. Their reactions are always: surprise that they like Ethiopian food and that they want to come back for more.
5	I absolutely adore this place...I am obsessed with Ethiopian cuisine and this place stole my heart!  I tried several dishes the: Doro Wat (chicken) and the Alicha Sega Wat (beef) with the misir wat (red lentils)...OMG I think I went to heaven for the few minutes that I was eating!  Of course I had to eat it with injera the spongy bread!  I love their injera more so then Blue Nile...I also tried their black tea...I do not recall the name but it was delicious!  I have since returned about 5 or 6 times and everytime it is more delicious!  I wish that this place was down the street from my house but it seems like there are not many ethnic restaurants outside of Tempe.  I am okay with it...its not too far...I am trying to get my boyfriend and son into this type of cuisine but they are apprehensive!  Anyways...everyone should try this place...another great thing about this place is that its great for those that are vegetarian too!  In fact, as I am writing this review it is making me want Ethiopian food!  TRY IT!!!!!
4	The food is good and they give generous portions.  The interior is nicely furnished and has several pictures and items from Ethiopia.  Their wine selecton looks good but I have only been here for lunch.  You can't go wrong with any of their combo dishes.  One warning though, this place might make you a bit gassy...
5	I love this place. I just tried the other Ethiopian restaurant in the Valley, and was disappointed, and my gratitude for Cafe Lalibela multiplied. The food here is fresh and authentic, and the staff are really nice. I'm so lucky to live down the street! Tons of vegan options, too.
5	I love Ethiopian food, and I love Cafe Lalibela. Their vegetarian combo plate is always reliably filling and flavorful, and the spiced iced tea hits the spot in the summer weather. My meat-eating friends tell me the meat dishes are great as well, but they recommend doing a combo rather than the big plates of just one type. Apparently too much of one gets overwhelming. I alternate between here and Blue Nile because I love them both!
5	When a friend says, "Let's go get African food" when I suggest frozen yogurt, I have to say yes.We chose Lalibela. She had been here before, and I had it bookmarked for months. It was only a matter of time before I'd walk my adventurous palate into the door, sit down and nosh on some wicked awesome Ethiopian grub.The menu has something for everyone. The meat lover, the vegetarian, the pescatarian. I ordered, the #16 (check out the picture), which features a nice plate of injera (the spongy bread that is so much fun to play with), and on top, had three different kinds of meat. All were flavorful. The beef was spicy, and oh so aromatic. My nose had a party that would've made Amy Winehouse proud (too soon?)My friend ordered the Vegetable Combination with two servings of red lentils (one serving in lieu of another vegetable dish), and the gomeh (collard greens). I got to sample, and it was delicious.Each of our plates came with extra injera. Just enough to eat, and when you are done, you have a little to play with. :) It has a sourdoughish flavor to it, and it complements the flavors of each dish in ways that most breads don't. This was a pretty busy restaurant for a Monday night. It's small, very down to earth. Bring people whose company you enjoy. You are going to eat with your hands. There are NO utensils. You will spill. It's not going to be very pretty or neat, but it will be a blast. This place reminds me of Nyala, a restaurant in the Little Ethiopia district of Los Angeles. It brought back a lot of fond memories. I'll definitely come back to Lalibela.
4	Eating with a fork is OPTIONAL - how great is that?  (not a first date recommendation my friends!!)Good service always.  Interesting Menu options always.  Wishing I brought more friends so we could order more variety - ALWAYS!Personal favs - the collard greens and the spicy beef, skip the rice and eat more magic sponge stuff (I think in the Bible they called it 'manna from heaven").  All round neat place to eat especially if you get bored with mainstream corporate chains like Moi!
4	Really good, really unique.  I had never had Ethiopian food, but we went out with (vegetarian) friends who recommended it, and we're always game for something new.Super-friendly owner and waitstaff.  The food was super tasty and lots of fun.  I decided to pass on the meat dishes and go veggie like our friends did, and we had a wonderful array of stews.  I ordered the vegetarian  was terrific.  A couple of lentil dishes, chickpeas, split yellow peas, string beans w/carrots & onions, and a potato/cabbage mix.  Really tasty, and fun to pick up the stews with the injera (kind of like a firmer crepe/pancake.  Reminded me of eating a mix of Moroccan, Lebanese and Indian foods.  So good.The iced black tea (with cinnamon, cardamom & cloves) is a great accompaniment. We'll be back.
4	The Yelp Supper Club had decided on Ethiopian cuisine, having chosen a restaurant with the same type of cuisine up the street only to find them closed, Dave N. and I found ourselves here.  This was my first time in here and I am a relative Newbie to Ethiopian cuisine, but Dave N. was nice enough to clue me in on a few things.  I ended up creating my own 3 item plate with greens, lamb stew and fish stew.  I also chose some of their cheese to accompany the combo.  The injera was lovely and the food was flavorful and the service was stellar.  I can't wait to go back.
4	This is a carnivore, herbivore and omnivore's mutual heaven. As long as you enjoy flavor, you'll enjoy Lalibela's. We ordered the vegetarian platter, which comfortably fed four of us (and allowed for some mindless stew-stained injera noshing afterward). Favorites included the Misir Wat (spicy red lentil stew), Shiro Wat (a garlic-y, onion-y pea mash stew), and Yekik Alicha (yellow split peas with onions and tumeric). Of course, scooting injera from stew to stew, scooping up everything at once also seemed to be a pretty successful maneuver, even though it mixed the individual stew flavors. Everyone else really liked when I did that (not really). Do I regret it? No.I do have one regret though, which I shall reconcile upon my next visit, and that is that I did not leave Lalibela wearing a cloak made entirely from injera. But hey, that's why there's next time.
4	My very first time having Ethiopian food and I wanted to make sure the place I chose was good.  This place was excellent!  Highly recommended!
5	This is one of my favorite lunch locations, unfortunately I don't go often enough because it's not quite within walking distance of my office and requires getting in the car and driving.  I was lucky to get to go today for a friend's birthday, what an ethnic treat!   The food is always delicious, the hard part is deciding what 3 selections to pick, they're all so good.  It's located in a little strip mall, but they've made it nice and cozy inside, with ethnic colors, decorations, and music.  I always enjoy bringing along someone who's never been before, they're always pleasantly surprised.This is a definite must do, you won't regret it.
3	Nice people.  I'm not crazy about being served pre-prepared food that's not "slamming".  It was just ok for me.  I would go back for a group lunch or something, but the suggestion would not come from me.
4	This is a great place to go no matter what type of food you like as there's something for everyone! There's meat, spicy, vegetarian, vegan and it's all delicious! While sometimes the service is slow the food more than makes up for it!
4	This place is pretty fantastic.  Mindfully I have not had much (Read: Any) other Ethiopian food, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but everything I got was very good.  I wasn't in the mood for anything to spicy, so I got the "Mild Combination", which I was very happy with.Most vegetarian dishes I have had in the past usually have either lacks in texture, or lacks in flavor, but the fosolia I had lacks in neither. It was spiced perfectly, and although it was soft enough to eat similarly to a sauce with Injera, it still had quite a pleasantly solid texture to it.The Alicha Sega Wat was nice tender meat in a well seasoned sauce.  The only problem one could fault it with was that it was kind of monochromatic if flavor, but that one flavor was delicious, and when eaten with the Injera takes on a layered flavor that made it quite fantastic.I also got some Kootee (Tea made with leaves from a coffee plant) which was another great new experience for me.  The only thing that wasn't good was the salad, which was made with not the freshest lettuce, but there was so much delicious food, that I was not hungry for it anyway.
5	A must when you are visiting Austin and craving Ethiopian. My husband loved the meat dishes and I loved the vegetarian offerings. They had a different type of injira. It was still quite good. Parking might get tight. Plan on coming early.
5	This cafe provided me with my first Ethiopian cuisine experience. It was delicious and I am eager to go back. The most impressive thing to me was their selection of vegetarian dishes. They had as many options as those with meat which I really appreciate (doesn't happen very often.) The service was great. You can tell this is a family run restaurant that cares about their patrons. The food is very reasonably priced which make it easy to try a variety of dishes. We started with the shorba which is a lentil based soup. This was probably my favorite part of the meal, it was absolutely delicious---satisfying and hearty. We also had the vegetable combination which had 5 different dishes served on the injera, a crepe-like bread you eat the main dishes with.This is a fun way to eat (with your hands) and opened up a new world of foods for us! Can't wait to go back and devour a bowl of shorba.
3	Ethiopian food obviously isn't a very popular cuisine in America but this place is definitely worth the try. If you are on a budget I would suggest getting the lunch time sampler for a little less than $8 and you can choose from three popular dishes plus your choice of rice or Injera (always get the Injera for the full Ethiopian experience). The best way to describe Injera is as a spongy crepe that has a mild sourdough taste. This place is very vegetarian friendly. For my carnivores don't worry there's lots of beef and chicken dishes too. However, I wouldn't recommend mixing chicken and beef dishes unless your stomach is used to that type of mayhem. All of the food is very well seasoned and tender. My favorites are the Duro Wat, Collard greens and Potatoes and Cabbage. The service isn't spectacular nor is the atmosphere, but the ladies get the job done and refill your cups on a regular. Broaden your palate and give this place a try!
4	I can't say whether or not Blue Nile is better than Lalibela.  They both seem to have their pros and cons, which don't necessarily have to do with the food's flavor, but more so personal preferences on texture, price (Blue Nile is a bit pricier than Lalibela), and types of offerings (Blue Nile seems to have a more extensive menu than Lalibela).  Personally, I prefer to flavor and textures of Blue Nile but not so much to pay the difference in price.  So, I would choose Lalibela over Blue Nile.
4	I have now been to Lalibela twice.  My first experience was tastier, but the food here is solid.  I took a 1st timer to ethiopian food (also gluten-free) and she really enjoyed her meal.  The lunch special sampler is a great deal and of course I love all the vegetarian options.  My favorite is the Tikil Gomen which I double up on!
5	This place is a local treasure. The food is up to the standards of the great Ethiopian restaurants of Washington, DC. Get the Doro Wat and ask for an egg. The dark Ethiopian beer is an excellent accompaniment. The people who run this place are always very welcoming and the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable.
5	Wow...where to start...right when you enter the eatery, the environment is very friendly as well as the staff! The food was great! And being half Ethiopian, I know quality Ethiopian food. Their injera had a doughy texture and was amazing and I really recommend the Lalibela Exclusive if you're coming with a group or with the family. You can even also add other entrees with it and I really recommend their shiro wat too. Price was also reasonable and you will leave stuffed and satisfied!! Lalibela won't disappoint you! Great Ethiopian restaurant overall!!
4	I took my mom here when she was in town for Christmas.  We stopped in for lunch and neither of us had ever had Ethiopian food before.  I had read about them on their website and in many of the reviews here on yelp, so I kind of knew what to expect.  We were seated immediately, but it took about 10 minutes for our server to greet us.  We immediately ordered two of the lunch specials which we had brought out on one big plate, and it came out super fast!Everything was wonderful!  We had a lot of fun eating with the Injera and trying to decide which dish was our favorite.  We tried all six of the vegetarian items listed on the lunch menu.  My favorite was probably the Azifah (the cold lentil dish).  The Misir Wat (red split lentils) was really good too, and my mom's favorite was the Fosolia (lightly spiced green beans).  When the big dish was set in front of us, we looked at it and thought, this isn't very much food....but boy were we wrong.  We couldn't even finish it.  The Injera really fills you up I think!All in all...a great experience for a great price.  $20 including tip.  Can't beat that.  I will definitely be back!
1	The welcome we received walking in was colder than darth vader in outer space. As we walked to the table the hostess was not happy to seat us. We did not feel welcome and left to the Blue Nile on Rural and University. Blue Nile is great.... highly recommend over this place.
4	This is a restaurant where you simply come for the food. It's not fancy, service isn't that great, but the food is stick-to-your-ribs good, that fills your tummy and your soul....My favorite things on the menu (and I do think it's easier to just make your own plate combination) are the yellow split peas and the collard greens.......yummy, yummy, they make me feel so comforted! yeah, that's it, this is definitely comfort food.....I find the bean/legume dishes are so good that I don't even order the meat anymore. Oh! And the tea!! I loooooovvvveeee the yekemem shai (I hope I remembered that right..) It has the perfect amount of spices that it only needs one little packet of sugar (for my tastes) and it is the *perfect* cup of soothing tea....Now, don't expect speedy or attentive service when you come here.....like I said, this place is purely for the food. Also, this is a fair warning: don't forget to take some enzymes before you go, or, just make sure you don't have plans with anyone with next day....... you'll see what I mean (but, it IS worth it.....)
5	Best Ethiopian Food in Phoenix! Went there 3 times during our 6 day stay. If you don't like crowds dine on a weekday as weekends, especially for dinner, this place get crowded with discriminating foodies. Service does suffer when super crowded but for food this yummy it is worth the wait and hassle. Don't forget to get some honey wine to complement the rich stews.
5	Definitely a hidden gem! I had guest in from out of town and let's just say they were the ones that showed me this place. Way to be a great host huh? Anyways this place is definitely a hole in the wall, but that just makes it that much better. I'm from L.A. so I knew that this would be quite the experience. Today it wasn't too busy but it took about 10 min to get our order placed. Not a problem because we weren't in any type of rush. We ordered, my friend got the meat combination, I got the vegetarian since I am vegan and my other friend got a small plate of lamb cubes. Everything was quite wonderful, this was my first encounter with Ethiopian food and it won't be my last. I am quite the foodie and I love trying new foods from different cultures and quite particular, so glad that there is at least one good spot in Arizona for this. Oh how can I forget! You must get the honey wine... I don't like  wine but my friends were thrilled about it. I particularly was in love with the iced tea this one has cardamon in it and can either be iced or hot. I will for sure be back and look forward to getting the lentil soup and possibly a dessert. Let me just say if you are looking for a up-scale restaurant with all those fancy things that take your money with so-so food, this isn't it! It's a family business and they are making food like they would for their family. I'm sure that's how they keep the prices so low.
2	Seems there are only 2 Ethiopian restaurants in Tempe and I've now officially been to both. Unfortunately, Lalibela will have to settle for being 2nd best.I cam here with my girlfriend for Valentine's Day last week. It was our first time to Lalibela, but we're no strangers to Ethiopian food. So, we made reservations, were quickly brought to our table and everything was swell.They offered a Valentine's day menu, so we ordered the vegetarian special. It was about $36 and was allegedly a meal for two. Odd, because on their regular menu they have a meal for 3 at $38. In retrospect, we probably should have paid the extra $2 and taken home more leftovers. More bang for your buck.Either way, it's a pretty steep price for Ethiopian food. Most of which is very cheap to make as our meal was mostly peas, lentils, potatoes, salad and cabbage. We also got a bottle of Yellow Tail merlot @ ~$18. Both our food and our wine came out very quickly. And that was pretty much the last time we saw our server for the rest of the meal.I will hand it to Lalibela, the food is good. Very good. Perhaps even better than Blue Nile. But the price is steep and the lack of service really spoiled the night for us. It's not as if the place was busy. By the time our meal was finished there was only 3 other tables with patrons at them but none of them were receiving any service. Sure, we knew there were waitresses. We could hear them talking in the kitchen so they must exist! After maybe 15-20 minutes of sitting waiting on our check, empty water and no service to speak of I actually had go up to the front desk and wave down our waitress. This is completely unacceptable for any restaurant. Short of an emergency, there is no reason why a dining room should be left unattended for 15 minutes while there are guests. My feeling was that the servers got their food out and that's all that mattered. No "How's the food?" no refills on waters. Nothing.On top of that, Lalibela's menu lacks the diversity of Blue Nile. Not only does Blue Nile have great veg options, but they have sambusas, hummus, falafel, salads and a raw vegan menu. Lalibela just has about a dozen or so meat and vegetable dishes. Likely all that could be found at Blue Nile for a much lower price.I can understand why people come here. The food is good (the injera is certainly better than Blue Nile's), but the lack of service and the price are enough to keep me out of Lalibela for good.
3	Gastronomically curious students can escape the saturation of chain restaurants by coming here.For $5-10 bucks, you will be stuffed with a variety of slow-cooked meats and veggies.The sampler lunch special comes with a sufficient amount of injera, slightly sour and porous to soak up the sauces. The mild curry is a bit too sweet for me, but the hot curry is just right. The collard greens and lentils are tender.Service is lacking. There was one friendly waitress, while the other one gave weird looks. Refills were slow. The price was right and the food itself was great, but service knocks off a star. Ethiopian honey wine is available, you might want to get a bottle to distract yourself.
4	The food here is super delicious! I've lived close to this place for a couple of months now and one evening I was feeling like I really needed to try something new. This place was my first introduction to Ethiopian cuisine and this place definitely impressed me. The layout of the restaurant is pretty simple. Small one room divided by a single wall, an area to pay and a back room where I'm sure the kitchen and dish washing room are. The service was very friendly and they didn't make us feel awful when we asked for silverware! Shortly after asking for silverware we noticed everyone around us was eating with their hands. Oops, my bad on not using proper dinning etiquette. I slowly stopped using my fork through out the meal.My boyfriend an I ordered the vegetarian combo and we were more than thrilled with it! Great flavors and the pairings are perfect. Some warm and spicy, mild and flavorful, and don't even get me started on the wheat sourdough crepe you get with the meal. ADDICTED. I want some right now.If you need some yummy exotic eats, I highly recommend this joint.
2	Def had better. Seems they cater to the locals...had high hopes and totally disapointed. Went for the meat dishes, not sure how the vegetarian plates are.
3	Yikes. I completely forgot about the fact that my boyfriend found a big black hair in the food close to when we were almost finished eating. How could I have forgotten that?? As delicious as the food was, that can NEVER happen when you are running a restaurant. Super gross :(
5	I love this place for lunch.  They have a great lunch special, good price and delicious, and they're quick for lunch!  And very friendly!  The worst part about coming here for lunch is the parking, if you come at noon it's quite hard to find a spot because of the two other great lunch places in the plaza.  Anyway, for the lunch special you can choose three dishes from the 4 meats and 6 vegetarian options, plus you get rice, injeera or both.  I love the spicy chicken, spicy beef, spicy lentil, collard greens, and potatoes.  (it's difficult for me to choose just 3!)it's a lot of food at a good price.  yum.
3	I love Ethiopian food and although this place is ok, I have had better. I didn't care for the service we received but the food was good.  There are other Ethiopian restaurants I would pick before heading to this one but if you are in the area and want to give it a try it's a great option.
5	First time we had Ethiopian, and boy was it an experience! If you've never had Ethiopian before, you should definitely try it out.I don't think you can go wrong with anything you get here.  I think we had a beef stew and a lamb dish.  The food is all presented the same. Everything comes out on top of a plate with a giant piece of injeera, as well as a basket of extra injeera on the side. There are NO utensils, so be prepared to get messy! Still, that is part of the eating experience, and it's fun! The food was delicious. It had a nice spicy kick to it, and the injeera was, well, very different. My best description of it is a spongy, sourdough-flavored crepe. But really, you just have to try it.The food portions didn't seem like a lot, but it gets filling very fast. When the food came, we thought we'd eat it all and then need to order more, but we only ate a little more than half and were full! Because of that, the pricing is excellent (just a little over $10 a plate). We felt the service was excellent as well. Our water never went below the halfway point!
4	I was excited to try my first taste of ethiopian food so we drove all the way to Tempe! I ordered the spicy combination with chicken, beef, and lentil stews and my boyfriend go the meat combination which also had the spicy chicken, spicy beef, and a buttery chicken stew. These meals came with something called injera which is like a tortilla like flat bread that is soft, chewy, a bit like sponge texture.Everything was delicious! My favorite was the spicy chicken stew. The flavor was bold, the chicken was tender, and with the injera was awesome! Overall it reminded me of some of my favorite indian food at punjabi tandoor. The portions were large and the service was great. Next time, I want to try their tiramisu which won best in the valley!
1	I now know why Ethiopians are so skinny, their food is gross and a huge pain in the ass to eat.  I wouldn't eat it either if it was all I had.  The whole eating with your hands might be quaint for some folk, I just find it welfare and cheap.  Call me crazy, but I enjoy a utensil now and then.  I say to the folk of Ethiopia "treat yoself - get some forks". All in all I'd say that's as close to Ethiopia as I hope to ever come, and the next time someone recommends this restaurant or type of food, it will serve as grounds to immediately never speak to them again and put a horrible curse on their sad existence.
4	Before I came back to WA I went to Lilibela for diner with daughter and it was a good dining experience for my first time trying Ethiopian food.  I had the spicy chicken and lentils and it was delicious!  Daughter had beef, lentils and vegetables and they were also very good.I highly recommend this restaurant for people that like trying different foods and are willing to experience what the world has to offer, if you don't like spices, curries and different vegetables, this place is not for you.I will go back there as soon as I go back to AZ!
5	I am upping the rating. Best vegetarian options anyone can get. Cannot go wrong with the vegetable combo. G approved.
4	I've had Ethiopian food before, with lackluster results and so decided that I didn't really like it. But then my parents offered to take me here and pay for my meal (free food!) so of course I accepted. First off the place is small and may look kinda shabby on the inside, but the atmosphere is curiously intimate. I felt like we could sit here for hours savoring our meal and they would not care! All the ladies that work here are awesome and very attentive. I ordered the Vegetarian plate, which comes with three different items plus a small salad & lots of their bread. Man, the salad was so good, the dressing is to die for! I loved everything on my plate and I *thought* I didn't like Ethiopian bread, but that was before I had Lalibela! It was very good and I would SO come back here. Next time I want to try their soup!
5	Love the people, the food, the ambiance. We've been going there for years!!
4	I love this place; great food and atmosphere, I however have maybe been there thirty times and have yet had good service.
5	Cafe Lalibela is one of the best places I've ever found to get Ethopian food.  The food is all reasonably priced and they have a fantastic selection - lots of new things to try.  No utensils here - everything is eaten with injeera bread, which also adds to the unique experience.  They have fantastic teas here as well.
5	Really tasty food.  Great price.  Friendly and relaxed hospitality.  I had the "Three Meat Combination" wat platter.  It was sublime!
3	First time at this restaurant yesterday. My husband and I were excited about trying this restaurants after reading good reviews on Yelp. But we got mixed feelings.I liked this cute restaurant. It's clean and cozy and the people working there were nice and friendly to us. My husband enjoyed the light Ethiopian beer. But the food....that's the thing.Some were good and some were not so good. We ordered a chef's combo and vegetarian combo. Both came with the crepe like Ethiopian bread and side salad. Each combo had 3-4 different dishes which were spicy chicken, cheese, collard green for the chef's combo and lentils, green beans, cabbage(w/potato&carrot) and collard green for the vegetarian combo. Chicken and lentils (spicy ones) were pretty good but most of the others had more or less the same kind of taste, salty and sour....yes, "salty and sour" explains their food. The cheese and bread had almost no taste for me. Overall, I got a feeling they were missing "taste".For dessert, we shared a mango mousse cake which was home made and tasty. So my feeling is...if we choose right dishes, we can enjoy their food better, maybe? We do not eat beef or lamb, so they might be good. Will I recommend this place? I don't know...you can give a try. Will I go back to this place again? Maybe not. I will try somewhere else.
3	Service was spotty (we literally had to go get someone to refill out waters).Food was good, I've only eaten at one other Ethiopian place (Zemam's in Tucson) but the food here was on par with what I've eaten there. The Injera was wonderful and tasty. The dishes we had on our injera platter included: lentils, lamb, chicken, collard greens, cabbage and potatoes.The decor was simple, with Ehtiopian art adorning the walls. The woman who was our waitress was nice, but not very attentive. I would probably go there again as the food was good, but considering that there weren't even that man people in the restaurant (four tables when we arrived, but two left pretty early into our meal). So considering they couldn't even take care of two tables leaves me wondering if their service is also this spotty.On their business card it also says they have great Tiramisu. Sadly, I did not get a chance to try it.
4	Great Ethiopian...only reason it doesn't get five stars is that I've been to Adams Morgan in DC and had some really great Ethiopian!  For the valley, this is one of the best places to find Ethiopian and the vegetarian platter is very good.  Plus, they have sweet wine here...guaranteed to make your visit even better!!
4	At least a solid 4-star rating!  We went there last night as a party of 3.  My wife & I had eaten at Blue Nile a few years ago and enjoyed it, but on this occasion we took our sister-in-law to Lalibela for a new experience.We were all pleased with the prompt greeting, seating of our choice, and efficient, friendly service.  We ordered the 3 person assorted platter with several choices each of meat and vegetarian dishes, nicely spiced, with ample injera to mop it up with.  Added a bottle of wine and a couple of Ethiopian beers and the evening was complete.  No one went home hungry, and all were plotting for our return visit!You can't go wrong choosing Lalibela, especially if your group enjoys trying new cuisines and loves great food!
3	Food was tasty. I ordered the veggie combo, and was a little disappointed that it didn't come with more of a variety of things, especially for $12. BUT what it did come with was good.
3	I ate here last night with a friend. Finding their chef's combination options to be a little pricey, I decided to order two entrees individually, and my choices were their misir wat (spicy red lentils) and the tikil gomen (cabbage with carrot and potato). I really enjoyed the misir wat. It was nicely spiced and I wish I could have ordered more of it. The injera bread was also very good, tasty and possessing a nice texture. As for the tikil gomen, it was okay, but tasted a little flat, and I don't recall it tasting that flat at other Ethiopian restaurants. Another thing I found to be flat here was the service, which was generally inattentive and unfriendly. The waitress was having a splendid time socializing with someone at the front counter when I came in, but had the most sour expression on her face when she interacted with me. No, I was not looking for friendship and conversation, but would it have been so hard to crack a smile when I entered and requested a table? Especially since, at that time, I was the only customer in the restaurant. Also, would it be too much to ask for a refill of water when my glass is empty? I would give this place another try because of the food, but the quality of service does not make me feel inclined to return here anytime soon.
4	Great place for lunch, friendly service and tasty food.
5	The best key sega watt (spicy beef cubes) in town!  My only complaint would be the high prices and lack of service on water refills (when i'm eating something spicy, i expect LOTS of water refills).  It's definitely filling and the ingera bread is actually really healthy for you... it's made with TEFF, a type of flour.  If you like meat, don't let your tastebuds miss the key sega watt!
4	Great place especially if you bring the whole clan and get the meat and veg combo plates to share. Very nice server as well. Lemoncello cake was the only disappointment, just a basic lemon cake.
4	I love this place.  The food is always tasty (who knew that greens could taste so delicious) and the lunch special can't be beat.  Sometimes it's tough to find parking, but be persistent.  You won't be disappointed.
5	I have no clue as to Lalibela's level of authenticity--but whether it is authentic or not is immaterial to me.  The food is TOP NOTCH!!!!  I can't get enough.  Never had Ethiopan before I went here, but after the first try, I was hooked.  My wife is good with a 2-portion combo, I usually get 3 portions.  I walk out stuffed and good for the rest of the day!  Delicious, and kind of fun to eat with the hands once in a while.  I will warn you:  if you have a sensitive stomach like I do, you will spend the rest of your day either extremely gassy or suffering from bowel evacuation on a fairly consistent basis.  But it is well worth the trouble based on taste/eating enjoyment!To the dope who wrote about it being "low class" and that you "would rather starve," obviously you've never been starved before (I have).  Believe me, dipstick, if you're ever in that situation, you'll eat whatever is finally put in front of you in any manner possible, even if you have to lick it up off the floor.
5	So delicious.  Try their tea, it tastes like Christmas.
5	Pretty inexpensive, and still the best Ethiopian spot in town!
5	My family's favorite Ethiopian restaurant.  I usually order the spicy combination. instead of the meat combination because it is really just a spicy meat combination.  The lunch specials are also a good deal with good portion sizes.  My daughter has counted Lalibela as one of her top five favorite restaurants since she could count to five.  It was nice to have a restaurant that didn't serve pizza in the top five.  She usually has the red lentils even though they are a little spicy.  My wife loves the vegetarian combination.  And a bottle of honey wine completes the meal.
5	Yum Yum Yummy!!!
4	This was my first true foray into Ethiopian food, and it was phenomenal. In fact, if I had other Ethiopian food experiences to compare it to, I'd probably go with the rarely given five stars. The menu has just the right amount of items and allows for a lot of customization. I went with the spicy combo. It was indeed spicy, but in a rich and complex way. I paired it with an oh-so-refreshing iced Shai tea. It tasted exactly like Oregon Chai concentrate mixed with water rather than milk. Methinks mixing it with milk would be incredible. I ate the combo platter the traditional way, using the spongy, crepe-like bread to pick up spicy, tender, fragrant, delicious chunks of meat and smashed split peas. My hands got quite oily, but that's what they make napkins for. A friendly tip, though: if you eat the spicy platter with your hands, scrub the stuff out of them (like more than washing your hands twice like I did) before you attempt to take contacts out. The meal was filling and affordable. I will definitely return.
4	Lalibela is a friendly, mom and pop style restaurant.  We came with a large group (and reservations) for dinner.  We shared the meat combination, family style.  Each combination platter is listed as serving 3 people - but we had 4 people per order and it was more than enough.  The food is the best Ethiopian food experience I have had.  The major flaw was very slow service.
4	I just read my first review of this business.... and I quote "I would go back for a group lunch or something, but the suggestion would not come from me."  Oh what a tangled web we weave....   I did go back in a group lunch (twice since) and guess what - You guessed it, the suggestion DID in fact come from me.  And boy was I ever so happy that I did.I'm bumping Lalibela Cafe UP a notch because the food was incredibly good.  Recently, I went here with a group of folks who like to "tour the world one spoonful at a time".  I chose Lalibela because I wanted to choose a restaurant centrally located from the continent of Africa and because the Yelp reviews down lie!  You don't get 4 stars here for nothing!  Definitely worth a 3rd trip for me.The group was seated promptly.  Everyone at the table enjoyed their food... how do I know?  Because every plate was cleaned!  I mean cleaner than clean!  When we ran out of injera to clean the plates, more was ordered!  If you plan to go there for lunch, there are 3 different types of lunch specials.  I would recommend the #2 lunch special in which you can choose different wats (like an Indian curry or a stew) to eat with your injera (crepe like pancake) - Here's a breakdown of what I ordered in my last visit, I had the Doro Wat (Spicy Chicken) and they Key Sega Wat (spicy beef) and a lentil based wat with injera.  I would have eaten it all, but I couldn't.  I had to be rolled out of that place my tummy was so full.  The fact of the matter is, and clearly, my last 2 experiences here have been fantastic with the latest one being even better.  Try them, you will like it. Parking can be very tricky at lunch time.  You may want to get in the area before noon.  I've never been for dinner.
5	We discovered Lalibela thanks to a friend who lives in the area, who'd seen it reviewed on "Check Please, Arizona." We're vegetarians who are always looking for great places to eat on the road, and when Ethiopian food is good, it's very good indeed, so we were very excited to give it a try.We were not disappointed. The first thing you notice when you step in the door is the enticing smell of berbere, the classic spice mixture of Ethiopia. If you haven't experienced it, let's just say that it's the kind of smell that says "really, really good food here."We ordered two individual veggie platters, each of which consisted of three wats (stews) -- misir wat (a red lentil stew seasoned with berbere and herbs), gomen (stewed collard greens with garlic and onions), and tikil gomen (lightly spiced carrots, cabbage and potatoes) -- and a salad on a bed of injera (a crepe-like, fermented, teff-based bread), with a generous basket of injera on the side. The flavors were just wonderful...as good as any Ethiopian food I've ever had.In fact, it was so good, we went back a couple of days later. This time, being major fans of all things legume, we ordered a regular "family-style" platter with double portions of mesir wat, shiro wat (ground peas seasoned with berbere, garlic and ginger), yekik alicha (yellow split peas with turmeric and herbs) and a single portion of the tikil gomen. So, so, so good! Everything was so flavorful, we kept picking at it long after we were way too full to eat another bite.The atmosphere in the restaurant is very casual. It's situated in a strip mall, and has kind of a "hole in the wall" feel, but it's the kind of "hole in the wall" that everyone wishes he'd discover...an unpretentious place that just happens to serve exceptionally good food.Service was prompt and pleasant on both visits.If we lived here, we would definitely be regulars (probably very fat, but happy, regulars!). As it is, we will definitely be repeat customers, should our travels bring us back to the area again.
5	Crazy good Vegi platter. Gobbled it up. Washed it down with a unique stout from Ethiopia too. Very friendly staff, highly recommend. Will be back next time I'm in Phoenix.
4	Having read a book about Ethiopia, I wanted to try the delicious food.  I'm so glad I did.  In fact, I brought my family, kids aged 15 and 13, they loved it as well.  The atmosphere is strip mall casual, but the food is excellent.   It was just the right amount of spicy, the flavors of the various meats and vegetables blending perfectly.  We will be back!
4	Service is slack but the food was GREAT!
4	5 stars for the food, service, and location. I love, love, love eating here. The spices are unlike anything I have ever eaten before, and it is absolutely addicting. Wonderful for children, vegetarians, families, parties, or getting together with your classier and hard to please food snobs. The only reason I rated a 4 instead of a 5 is the sheer upset my stomach was in for 24 hours following the food. I know that over time, it will get better, but if you have a cautious or "not-withstanding of new spices" kind of digestive system, beware!
5	Really loved this place. The service was slow around 1:00pm on a Saturday. We were a party of 4 adults and 2 kids and the Veggie Combo for 3 was more than enough. Did have to order more Injera bread. The veggies had such amazing and different flavors from each other. My favorite. Although their website advertises the gluten free injera, when we asked for it, they said they did not have any so our kid had to eat some rice instead.
1	Different food but not great. Service is very bad and slow. We were a group of 10 people went for lunch, the lady who served us was very rude. When we asked asked for the straws she literally threw them on the table. And the food was served to us after 45 mins. Regarding food, I feel the food had raw curry powder flavors and pretty much all the food items had similar taste.
5	The food here is great!! The service was great and your definitely get your moneys worth. If you're in the mood to experiment sit in the carpet room and enjoy your dinner.
4	I can't believe I forgot to review this place! I went a couple months ago with a friend. We were both a little worried that we wouldn't like it, especially because I had Ethiopian food once before and didn't love it. Well, I did end up liking this alright (not my favorite, but definitely not bad). I asked the waitress for her suggestion and she seemed a little exasperated with me (but what do you expect?). At her suggestion, I got the Key Sega Wat (spicy beef stew) and the Misir Wat (spicy lentils). Both had a lot of flavor, but neither was really spicy, which disappointed me. I don't know how soon I would go back here, but if I did ever feel like Ethiopian food again, I would give this place another shot.
4	Pretty solid Ethiopian food. My only comparisons are Chicago-based, but this was a nice find. (This is really late...so I hope they're around and still serving the same I had - it was awesome!)
5	I absolutely loved this restaurant. My brother had previously tried it and suggested it,so we went there on a whim. I'm open to trying new food so I was excited to try the raw "kifto." It was no surprise that majority of their menu is eaten with your hands and not utensils, that's just how it's done. I noticed a fellow reviewer really put them down for that, but I don't feel it should be negative considering thats  the culture, experience it. The amount of spices in their food is expected so for people with sensitive stomachs, I suggest really taking your time with the menu and possibly googling some things if you have a smart phone. The service was wonderful and very attentive, my glass was never empty. Go in with an open mind and a smile. It was quiet and clean. It looks fAmily owned so the service may be different if its really busy. Overall I had a wonderful experience.
4	I have never had Ethiopian cuisine before so I thought I would give it a shot. So I went there at around 5pm on a Wednesday evening. The service was a little slow with only one person to run cash register and wait on tables. There were only a few people in the restaurant itself but the carry out customers were a fairly steady stream. We decided to order the "Vegetarian Experience" even though there were only 2 of us because we wanted to try all the vegetarian options. The ingredients themselves were fairly simple but the flavors were extremely complex and tasted amazing. Even the salad tasted amazing with the lemon dressing. The portion was very large and more than enough as we ended up taking about half of it home. For desert we had the mango mousse. It was a perfect dessert with it being light and fluffy and the sponge cake soaked in pineapple juice on the bottom was just the extra kick to put it over the top. Definitely a great value and delicious food. My only knock on the experience was the service was a little slow, but I will definitely go back!
4	Really like this place.  We've eaten here twice now and the food is consistently good.  I met a woman from Ethiopia who said it is very authentic food and she also recommends Lalibela.  The staff is very attentive and the price very reasonable.
4	What does an Indian do when they are bored of indian food but still want the flavors and the dining experience? They go to Cafe Lalibella. Absolutely delish ethiopian food with tastes so similar to home. Going to this place always makes me philosophical- we are more alike than we think. Try the veggie platter because then you get to try everything. In the non veg , the chicken stew is the best. The communal dining experience with one large plate and just sharing among friends makes the experience even more enjoyeable. The service coud be a tad slow but can be forgiven and forgotten.Finally, i absolutely love the tres leches here ( who knew). Highly recommended.
5	Foursquare tells me I have been at this place 64 times. I must have missed a lot of check-ins because I eat Lalibela at LEAST once a week. I have been going for years and have taking dozens of people and never had anyone not like the food (ok maybe one). This place rocks, the staff are great and the Misr Watt. MMMMFor me I get the lunch special Misr Watt, Misr Watt and Misr Watt with extra Injera!
5	Delightful!  I went with some friends there for a birthday celebration.  We ordered one of the sampler dishes with meat.  OMG.  I could not stop eating.  It was phenomenal.  I had had Ethiopian food once before and thought the injera bread was too weird.  I now realize that other place didn't make it right.  I highly recommend Cafe Lalibela to anyone who loves Ethiopian food or enjoys middle eastern food and wants to venture out and isn't afraid to use their hands to eat, as is the Ethiopian culture.
5	This might be the best food I've had in 18 years living in Arizona. Wow.
4	Not the nicest looking place overall, but good enough to chow down and have a good time.  The service was super friendly and attentive, and the food was totally awesome.  We had one of the huge plates to share between the four of us, which was more than enough, with lots of great variety of things to try.  Some of us got a little uncomfortably full, probably because of the bread, but probably just a learning experience for the type of food.  Very good, and I'd definitely go back.
4	I'm a huge fan of this place and always will be.My boyfriend and I commonly come to eat, before seeing a show at Gammage. The food is always good, the beer is always cold, and the waitresses are always incredibly nice.Plus, I love their birthday coupons they send out for you to use the next time your in.  I'm almost positive they never expire too. SO WORTH IT!If you like Indian, Thai, Spices, etc, come.  You wont be disappointed.
4	Gluten Free- Injera bread! ScoreFood is consistently good. Service is attentive, but not super smiley... but eh, I'll survive. It's hilarious to me, but they offer a bunch of american/italian desserts. Can't get myself to try the tres leches nor the tiramisu from an Ethiopian place. But who knows, perhaps it's delicious. We stick to the vegetarian platters - spiced perfectly - great in winter time.
5	Nice retaurant in AZ...Nice selection and very authentic. I definitely recomend this place if you are in Phoenix area.
5	For our first Ethiopian food experience, we opted for the Lalibela Exclusive - a HUGE sampler of most of their menu offerings. Did I mention how much food this was?! Definitely too much for 2 people (the menu does state for 3+), but we were greedy and indecisive and I thought this was a perfect choice. We liked everything on the 18+ inch tray, but our favorites were the doro wat (chicken), key sega wat (beef), tikel gomen (cabbage), and misir wat (red lentils). Their iced teas are yummy and service was informative and attentive! The sampler was pricey, but now that we know what we like we can order more cheaply. Definitely worth the unique experience. We'll be back!
4	Service is not that extraordinary but the food.... Oh boy, that's another story! Because of this restaurant I am absolutely in love with Ethiopian food, it tastes wonderful and I crave injera all the time!!
5	I love this place! The food is crazy delicious and the service is good. They are quick at lunch and have great lunch specials during the week.  I have never had a bad meal here.  The menu is great and everything they make is delicious.
3	Very interesting and different food choice. Service was adequate - they wanted to know if we had reservations for our party of 8 which I guess seems an acceptable question. They were not quick on refills. Although we got two meat platters for 3 and one veggie platter, we were only brought two platters. We asked the server if we were getting another one of the meat platters but she said that the two meats were combined. Looking at the next table there was a couple with the same amount of food on their platter. Surely they didn't order for six people.... The bill comes and we were charges for three. The food was decent. A little bland compared to Indian or other ethnic foods. It is probably legitimate Ethiopian so that could explain it. You do get a lot of food for your money that is relatively tasty.
5	How ironic. It was around 26 years since we had eaten Ethiopian food. We just don't have any near home. When we were in Phoenix around the 24th of August, we celebrated our 25th Anniversary at this restaurant which was within 5 minutes of our motel. They were very busy with quite a variety of clientele and the food was delicious. We only wished we could take some with us.
5	Went to Cafe Lalibela for the first time today for lunch.  The lunch special was very reasonably priced, and offered a taste of several Ethiopian dishes.  Very tasty food at a good price? Yes please.  I'll be coming back for more very soon!
5	Perfect for date night or family night.  My kids love the exotic flavors you eat with your hands.  The service is always fantastic and food is great.
3	This was the first time my husband and I have tried Ethiopian food. Honestly I couldn't tell you what I was expecting because I had nothing to base the expectation off of. It was better than I could have imagined! It was really just great.I had one of the vegetable platters and it was amazing. I am a vegetarian and I have a lot of food allergies so a lot of the time we go out to eat I end up feeling uncomfortable, nauseous, or full on sick.. After eating here I felt great, the food was clean and light and delicious.
3	I'm sorry that I can't agree with others who have posted glowing reviews of this restaurant.  I simply wasn't that impressed.  This was my first time eating Ethopian food.  Seeing as Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in the world where people are starving, it seemed weird that they would have a cuisine to call their own in the first place.  I had the vegetarian platter, which came with several different kinds of items, all placed on top of a tasteless, spongy bread.  None of the items were bad.  Everything was decent.  It just wasn't great.  The spices they use are very similar to what you'd find in Indian food.  Maybe if they used the spices a little more liberally, the food wouldn't have been so bland.  The ambiance in the restaurant was also of a slightly lower standard than I would have wanted.  It's not very fancy.  I was there on a date, and this wasn't exactly the type of place where I would go again on a date.  I think this is more of a restaurant where I'd bring my family to eat.  But if you require a place that inspires romance on some level, this isn't the place for you.  For all the unflattering things I've said about this place, one of the best things about it is that everything is very reasonably priced.  It's not like they're giving you less than what you paid for.  The prices are commensurate with the quality of food and type of restaurant this is.  I would eat here again.  I was just hoping for better on my first dining experience.
4	Lalibela feels like a place you'd imagine stumbling into on the streets of Addis Ababa, close to where the owners are actually from. The food is consistently fresh, delicious and reasonably priced and the selection of Ethiopian beverages is a lot of fun to explore. Improvements: The staff is extraordinarily reserved and a couple ceiling tiles need replacement.
5	This terrific cafe serves delicious food in large portions at reasonable prices with great service. The #17 vegetarian platter is a tasty way to taste a bunch of different options.
1	Four of us enjoyed dinner there this week but within hours three of us had major stomach issues which to put it mildly put a damper on our enthusiasm for this restaurant.  Be warned.  We had beef, chicken, salad and vegetarian dishes.  Caveat emptor!
5	I have been to Cafe Lalibela about 5 or more times now, and my boyfriend and I LOVE their food.  For those of you who are opposed to eating with your hands or are not a big fan of vegetables, Ethiopian cuisine may not be a good option for you.  We took a friend and his date with us the other day, and although the girl  stated she was cool with anything, we could all tell that she wasn't enjoying it.  If steak, grilled chicken, potatoes and salad are the main staples on your palate, and you dislike deviating away from them, choose somewhere else.   My boyfriend and I have had just about everything on the menu, but we always come back to the vegetarian combo (number 15) as our favorite choice.  The platter is for 3 people, but we usually finish the platter between the two of us.  We always try to pick our favorite among the collard greens, lentils, green beans, cabbage, and peas, but we give up because they are all so good.  If you are a vegetable lover like us, I think you will find your favorite among their offerings.  The flavors in the dishes are all distinctively unique and delicious.  I think my opinion of Ethiopian food gets better every time I visit the restaurant.
4	1st time here. The food is excellent. A nice alternative to mexican, fast food, or sandwiches.
4	My husband and I went there on a whim and were extremely pleased. The vegetarian and gluten free options were fantastic to include GF injera. We shared the vegetarian combo and left with full bellies. The service and prices are also appetizing! We will definitely go back.
4	So, to be fair, I've never had any other Ethiopian food before.  Ever.And, this place always gives me a wicked stomach ache, so some sort of spice they use or something doesn't agree with me.But, it's DELICIOUS!And it's vegetarian options are so tasty too!So, I'll continue popping a Pepcid and coming here for years to come
2	I wish I could agree with all the great reviews as well, but I can't.  We went right after Shabbat was over, and it was very busy (Saturday night).  There was food, paper and crumbs all over the table and under the table where we sat at.The food taste good, but nothing in comparison to what I am used to. The injera bread was ok, but not great.  Had to keep asking the waitress for refills and napkins.  OVERPRICED for the food...my opinion.  I have experience Ethiopian restaurants in American (Southwest region) and this just did not impress me.Limited parking when it is crowded in that plaza.
4	Service a little slow at peak hour, but friendly and welcoming.  Very good food.  My family enjoyed it a lot.
4	I think the food is comparable to, if not slightly better, than Gojo on Thomas. But Gojo is so much cheaper. Doro wat should come with an egg.
5	Went here for some authentic Ethiopian Coffee. Think I got it, came out in a clay pot pored into a tiny coffee cup. Tasted like a fresh espresso, and seem to have a little more caffeine then a cup of coffee I am used to. I might venture into some food next time.
5	I eat here at least once a week.  I love the food, the gluten free injera and the service is pretty consistent.  Been a go to spot of mine for many years now... Will continue to be that..
5	Cafe Lalibela is great!  I've only had Ethiopian at one other restaurant (in DC), but as far as I can tell, this place rocks!  We order the vegetarian platter.  I'm a pretty picky eater, but have no issues and love trying EVERYTHING in the platter!  The service is great - I've been here on weeknights as well as weekends and they always seat us quickly and the service is superb.  The injera is amazing - order extra!
1	This restaurant is so over priced and mediocre I can't even eat here at all. The best place to get Ethiopian food is ethio-african spices in Phoenix. Don't go anywhere else. Trust me. I spend 50 dollars on just me and my boyfriend at this cafe and the food is dripping with grease leaving you with gas every time, and the injera isn't that good. If u want perfect Ethiopian cuisine for a fraction of the cost SORRY BUT YOU HAVE TO GO TO PHOENIX.
5	As a visitor from out of town I wanted something healthy and vegetarian. This little gem of a restaurant is amazing!  Get the "Misr" ... A delish lentil dish!!! Yum :)
5	Amazing flavor fusion. Wonderful staff and great food. Was pleasantly surprised definitely worth a try, ESPECIALLY for vegans and vegetarians !
5	My first time here and it did not disappoint!I never had Ethiopian food before so I had no idea what to expect. First of all, the service was wonderful. Kind and warm and lots of smiles. I love all the authentic decor inside. It is not fancy but it is homey and has some great authentic crafts and pictures to really get a good feel for the Ethiopian culture.The food was so good. My husband had the fish, lamb, and collard greens. He loved it all but especially the fish. I had the cabbage and potatoes, red lentils, and collard greens. Loved it all as well. The lentils were medium spicy, just right. A little reminiscent of Indian food. The collard greens were mouth watering. Cooked perfectly.The flatbread thing it came with was definitely unique. Spongy and a bit sour. Takes a little getting used to but its good! They recommend picking 3 of their "mini" entrees. Each one is a very generous scoop. We each had 3 and we were stuffed. Next time we are just ordering 2 each... it is very filling. I was disappointed that they only had one Ethiopian beer in stock... the menu said there were 3. I wanted a lighter Ethiopian beer to complement my meal but they only had a dark brew. The selection of other beers they have are limited but good. I settled for an ice cold Stella.We have to try their tiramisu next time. It is supposed to be the best in the valley.
5	Chester's favorite. Chester has been going here for years, and the food and service is always improving. The yellow split peas give a mellow balance to some misir wat (spicy red lentils) or Chester's new favorite, cold spicy brown lentils. The cold brown lentils are peppery, lemony, and so fibrous (be careful).Food is served with injera, which is a spongy crepe like bread you use to eat the food with. Gluten free injera is also available. Soon they will carry their stuff at whole turds, too! Chester can't wait. P.S. Chester says, "don't forget the tums"
5	A family favorite, but we have to go when we are hungry!
5	I am a road  warrior and enjoy finding new places that are not main stream. The best food is always homegrown/locally owned, reasonably priced and causes u to wish they would go main stream. Cafe Lalibela is a fantastic restaurant with superb food, friendly and prompt service, and a casual atmosphere. Mona brought me the spicy combo; some chicken, beef, lentils, watt and cabbage. It was delicious; I at everything to the point of no return. (That is when u are full, know y should stop but can't). Fresh, complex, tangy, healthy and unique is how I would describe my meal. I will come back next time I'm in town.
5	This place might be my favorite restaurant in AZ. The food is all incredibly affordable, always served very quickly and the options are great. This place boasts an impressive vegan and vegetarian menu and literally everything on it is amazing. Service is always good as well, my drinks are always refilled, food comes fast, and the staff is very kind.Overall, definitely recommend! Great way to experience Ethiopian food and great dinner out without spending a lot.
1	It's a pretty bad sign when natives don't come to this restaurant. This is not authentic ethopian food and made specifically to cater to Americans. This was the first time I was offered a fork which was bad sign #1. The injera taste like a tortilla and nothing like authentic injera, bad sign #2. Finally the awaze tibs was bland and the doro wot was extremely sweet. Definitely won't be coming back here since this is pretty much saying panda express is authentic Chinese food.
3	This was my third time here and once again it was a really good experience.  We ordered #21 and it didn't disappoint. 21 has beef, yellow peas and a potato/carrot/cabbage dish. All were well made and flavorful. I love the sourdough flavor of the 'bread' -- not too sour to be overwhelming but a kick to know it's a bit different. Service is always ok...not exceptional but usually given with a smile.Seating is never a problem,  even with a larger group.We'll be back again!
4	**Original review from 5/20/2011. Updating new profile.**Mmmmmm I love this place. I've been coming here on a regular basis since 2007. Found this place because I was mad at my boss and was driving around and pulled in to try Essence Bakery and was distracted by the fact there was an Ethiopian restaurant in the same plaza. So I decided to try this place instead. So, so, so glad I did.(Regarding my first time) I walked in and immediately fell in love with aroma of the place. It was definitely tickling my senses. I ordered the doro wat (chicken) w/the traditional egg, misr wat (red lentils) and the fosolia (green beans and carrots in a tomato sauce). This was served with injera (looks like a crepe and tastes like a heavenly sourdough bread). To drink, I ordered the Yekmen tea, cold. Wow, talk about a drink to complement your food. This tea is fantastic.The food is very flavorful. The spices are well balanced. Their version of spicy/heat is pretty mild for my taste, but everyone has their opinions of this. I highly recommend getting the Yekemen/Yekmen chai, hot or cold, with your order. The spices in the tea complement the spices used in the food very well. This is coming from someone who always order water with her meals. This is probably the only place I order tea instead of water.I've heard some people complain about the service. Well, guess what, in Ethiopian culture, they are very laid back. This place does check on you, sometimes slowly. I'm grateful for that. Understanding the culture, I don't complain about the service. I do recommend that if you are in a hurry, place your order to-go.Here's the one downfall. Their food is a little on the oily side. Wat is a type of thick stew and most of the wat recipes call for kibae, a type of spiced butter. I thought at first that the oily part was going to be a problem for me, but after dining at Blue Nile, I discarded the notion. Blue Nile had almost none of this oil, but then again, they lack the flavor too. That's another review for later though. I'll take the flavor any day!I've since brought my mother, son, sister, friends, co-workers, clients and anyone I can think of. Their reactions are always: surprise that they like Ethiopian food and that they want to come back for more.
5	Yum yum yum is what I have to say about this place. I live right near it. Don't go often but when I do it never disappoints
4	I've never tried Ethiopian food before, but now I'm a fan!I came here on a Saturday night around 7 pm and there was no wait for my party of 6 people, which was great for us!  Around 7:30-8 the restaurant started filling up and by the time we left pretty much all the tables were occupied.We ordered the large vegetarian platter, which is supposed to feed 3+ people. I would say it could feed 4 people comfortably.  since we had more than 4 people we also ordered the individual meat platter, and plus I wanted to try some of the meat dishes.  while the meat dishes were alright, I preferred the vegetarian dishes by far.sadly, I don't know the names of what I was eating bc there were so many different dishes on the platter, but I really liked how they prepared the veggies.  I even liked the collard greens, which I was expecting to hate!the bread you use to scoop up the food is really interesting, it's a thin almost crepe like bread, but quite flexible and spongy.  it pretty much has no flavor to it, it's just a means for getting the food into your mouth. I liked the texture of it though, and it enhanced the meal.
5	I absolutely love this place! Their spicy platter is to die for!  We have been coming here for a long time and they never disappoint!!
3	I got the spicey combination it was good but too greassssyyyyy ... Nice staff maybe next time I'll try the vegetarian dish...
5	Soooo yummy! I'm a current San Francisco expat who is frequently searching for unique flavors and textures of food I frequent at home so finding this place was quite a huge moment. We went in on a weekday night so it wasn't busy at all. Everyone greeted us and asked if we needed any water or menu explanations. Super helpful and welcoming! Since there was 4 of us, we decided to go for a combination platter, said to feed three and then one entree platter, said to feed one. When the food came, we were so surprised by the portions! Our order could have easily fed 6-7 people! I've never seen Ethiopian food portions so huge, and I've been to multiple Ethiopian restaurants. What impressed me even more was that the servers were so excited to share what each part of the dish was, how it was made, what was in it etc. I love being able to go to places where the staff is really passionate about their product. It really shines through along with great customer service. Even if the food was awful (which it was far from), I would have still had a great experience here!Overall, amazing, flavorful food and wonderful customer service.
5	I highly recommend this restaurant! We ate a vegetarian dish and were totally satisfied. We ordered a vegetarian combination plate and our server recommended 3 additional sides. Perfect food presentation, excellent quality and variety! Our server was awesome - teaching us a tad bid about Ethiopian language and culture.The ambiance is comfortable, authentic and warm. The aroma is heavenly! I hereby confer a solid rating of 5 stars!
4	Lots of great reviews for a reason. There is an undeserved 1-star on here because of lack of 'authenticity' and the fact that they gave the user a fork. Well, guess what--I've been given forks at sushi restaurants that were fantastic. Some people don't know how to eat Ethiopian and that's fine. One thing you should definitely do is read the blurb on the front of the menu. Not only is it really interesting (the restaurant is actually named after an ancient church that was excavated) but it gives you helpful background on what you're about to get in to. Like other users note, injera (en-jee-rah) is weird. Looks like a sponge, feels like rubber, tastes like a sour sock. So, you get why Ethiopians eat it smothered in stuffs. Luckily, the stuffs are hella tasty, and vegetarian/vegan friendly. I'd recommend the spicy stuff (No. 9 was my favorite) but anything cold can get kind of odd. Lots of lentils are served here, and you can even buy the Lalibela brand at Whole Foods. What else can I say, the service was awesome, the food was unique and reasonably priced. If it's between you and one other person I'd probably only get three entrees, they are pretty big despite what the server will probably say. I didn't give five stars because I've only been once. Try it out soon.
1	Horrible injera, it was NOT warm or fresh at all. I have been to many Ethiopian restaurants. They explained that I must have gotten injera from places that serve fresh injera out the oven. Wth
5	If you've never had Ethiopian food before and you don't have Ethiopian relatives to cook for you, then I recommend Cafe Lalibela for your introductory pleasure. If you're a seasoned pro to this cuisine, this is the best Ethiopian (restaurant) food you'll find in Phoenix. As a vegan, I get the vegetarian combo, which comes with 4 hot dishes and a small salad. The hot dishes are misir wat (spicy lentils; my fav!), gomen (chopped collard greens), tikil gomen (cabbage & potatoes), & fosolia (string beans & carrots). The food is spiced to perfection; these are very authentic flavors. If you dine in, the food is served on top of injera bread. (If you despise soggy bread, be sure ask for the salad on a separate plate.) I'm not a huge fan of their regular injera; the taste is sour and a little "off" compared to the home-cooked injera I'm fed back home. But if you use your hands (as is the custom) to pick up the food with the bread, that taste is disguised. (They have forks, if you must.)  I've recently discovered that they have a gluten-free injera option which is actually really good; I was surprised! I prefer it over the regular injera.  The veg combo will last me 2 days when I'm not that hungry. When I'm being a hungry hippo, no leftovers for me. ;)If you're dining with friends, I suggest sharing the large veg platter. These combo & platter dishes are great for first timers (try several dishes to figure which you like) & regulars, like me, who want it all.  No vegan desserts, though. Boo. The owner is very nice, as are most of the workers. There is a worker who never smiles or seems to care. Don't take it personally; I think it's just her personality.
3	I hadn't eaten Ethiopian in over a decade before visiting this cozy spot in Tempe so I was expecting to be wowed.  Even though we were standing at the entrance for a little while before a table was cleaned off, the waiter cordially greeted and seated us.  It's a family restaurant so they can handle large groups.We ordered a meat platter and a veggie one.  The food was okay, not incredibly flavorful (the way I remembered Ethopian food.).  At first glance I thought the lamb was chicken and to tell you the truth, I couldn't taste the difference.  The beef was obviously red meat, but tasted only slightly different from the other meats.The yellow peas tasted lightly seasoned, and so did the cabbage.  I thought the green bean and carrot mix was the tastiest but unfortunately we had only one portion of it.  The injera was okay -  there was an ample amount of it.Didn't order dessert because nothing screamed Ethiopian dessert. What they served I could order at several other restaurants.
5	This is my favorite restaurant. Not just for Ethiopian, but my overall favorite restaurant. Very affordable and just really delicious food. I would eat here every week if it were close to my house. I'm very excited that they've started selling some of their dishes at Whole Foods now, particularly my favorites: misir wat, tikil gomen, and fosolia.
5	My husband and I love eating exotic food. Ethiopian happens to be one of our many favorites. We have tried many different Ethiopian restaurants, mostly in Chicago, and this place (to our surprise) was so much better than anything we had back home and at a better price too. Here are our favorites:The fish, red lentils, cabbage with potatoes, and the collards.Soooo good. We always max out our plates when we go here. Not a speck of food left on that large tray. Always happy to come here and love to crave it.
4	A little hole in the wall Ethiopian place... But really good food.  I enjoyed the   Combination plate and everything I ate that dayService is really goodThe only negative is that the curry they use on the different meats it all taste the same.  Definitely need to add some new flavors to give me dishes
4	This place is pretty good. I came from LA and went to Little Ethopia on Fairfax and was spoiled with all of the Ethiopian restaurants out there. I really like the spicy meat options at this place and the fact that they have gluten free injira. They even have a decent lunch special. Service is quick and the staff is really friendly. They also sell some of their products in Whole Foods now which is convenient because I live much closer to a whole foods. If they made sambusas here, they would probably get 5 stars! That may be the america in me but they are sooooo delicious!
4	I wish I could say I found this gem on my own, but alas I stole it from AZ centrals list of top ethnic restaurants. I agree!! We went for lunch and the lunch combo is cheap and a good size portion! The food is flavorful and unique. Depth of flavor was impressive. If Applebee's is your idea of a good dinner this place may not be for you. But if it's something out of the ordinary you crave, head to Cafe Lalibela
4	The food was a bit too different for me, but I think we all enjoyed trying it. I don't expect we'll be back until we have friends visiting who are very adventurous. Everything is stewed or sauces served with their sourdough crepe bread to scoop it up with. We loved the collard greens the best. The beef was great too! Be warned - they use a huge amount of butter. If you're sensitive to dairy, you'll have an upset stomach later.
3	(Lyrics - U2 - With or Without You)See the foodies in your placeSmell your food twist in the airI'll wait for youEat with hands and share a plateOn a bed of Injera I'll tasteAnd I try Cafe LalibelaCafe Lalibela.....Cafe Lalibela........Ethiopian food in PHX!? Well this dude had to try it out for sure!  Cafe Lalibela has had the reputation of being one of the best vegetarian restaurants in town, but they also serve meals with meat too.  Came here with my foodie buddies on a Tuesday night.  The place was pretty seemly on a Tuesday night!  Once we walked in the first thing that hit me was the aroma of the food.  Smelled pretty darn tasting if you were asking me and we couldn't wait to start!  As we sat I ordered  a beer.  I wanted to order the Ethiopian Coffee served in a clay pot, but boy it was a late Tuesday night and didn't want to keep myself up all night!  You could order family style or individual plates here.  If you go with the family style you will be dipping into your meals with other people sharing with you.  I felt uncomfortable with that so I shared my entree with my gal pal; we ordered the Meat Combination and Kitfo.  Truthfully, if you asked me how to pronounce some of the ingredients I couldn't, but the meat combination came with beef, lamb, and pork in different kinds of colored sauce.  Unfortunately, there's really no explanation of some of what we were eating.  The Kitfo was under-cooked or raw beef depending on how you liked it and in the end I didn't really care for it in general.  The red sauce mixed with it had a hint of spice, but didn't really care over much flavor.  The Meat Combination was okay at best, but nothing to amazing in my books.  Just saucy meat you ate with Ethiopian bread called Injera.  In the end, the experience was fun and the service was good.  The ambiance was lacking since I expected much more decors and flair to make you feel the culture and the food. - Enjoy!
5	Going here is a treat.Eat in or take out. I never repeat but have enjoyed everything. For myself it is fabulous food.
5	Loved it. I had the vegetable platter and ate the entire thing and almost all of the injera.  To drink I had the iced herbal tea.  Just in Phoenix for one night and I'm so glad I tried this place!  I may try to time my return trip so that I can eat here again in several days.
5	Consistent Ethiopian food.  Always fresh and tasty.  For some reason Ethiopian food tends to be polarizing - either you love it or hate it.  But, I've taken several friends here and they all have loved it!  They have recently branched out by having their food sold at Whole Foods in Tempe. Nice to see food from the continent reach the masses.  I wish them continued success!
5	My first ever taste of Ethiopian food - it was great!!! They even gave me instructions on how to eat it. The meat combination was terrific and the vegetarian combo looked equally good. This place is a must try for everyone. I'll be back for more!!!
5	What a great place.  If you like interesting foods (Indian, Thai, Middle Eastern), you will love this place. My first experience with Cafe Lalibela was take home from Whole Foods.  It was delicious. I figured I had to go to the source to try the food. It was awesome.  I love the Teff Injera bread.  Their meat dishes are awesome and the portions are quite healthy for the price. If you are in Tempe, you need to go to Cafe Lalibela.
4	Amazing injera. We got the lalibela combo platter for 3. Delicious chicken and beef, only wish the lamb wasn't sold out by the time we ordered.
5	I've been going to Cafe Lalibela Ethiopian Restaurant for many years now. Tonight's experience reminds me of my very first time here 12 years ago when my wife and I flew into Sky Harbor Airport late in the evening to visit Phoenix for a job interview. We were very hungry but couldn't find a place to sit and eat. We spotted this Ethiopian restaurant (in a strip mall of all places, we thought!) and decided to try it out. As we walked up to the entrance, we saw that Cafe Lalibela was closing for the evening (it was about 9 pm). In defeat, we turned to walk back toward our rental car, but the owner saw us and urged us to come in!  Mind you there were diners finishing their meals. Clearly we were going to keep them late. The owner and staff never minded though and we had an amazing meal. We now live in Phoenix and ever since that night, we bring nearly everyone who visits us from out of town to Cafe Lalibela after picking them up from the airport. Universally they are pleased with the food and friendliness and ask to return on subsequent visits to Phoenix.Tonight, I brought my parents, who just arrived in Phoenix to visit us, to Cafe Lalibela and found that the restaurant was closing early for the evening. The manager saw us looking at the 'Closed' sign and invited us in. He explained they had such a busy day today (a very favorable review in today's Arizona Republic will do that, apparently) that they ran out of several dishes, only had gluten-free injera bread left, and decided to close early. He explained that as long as this was okay he'd be pleased to have us dine here tonight. We were treated "like honored guests" as my dad noted and our meal was fantastic, as usual.Cafe Lalibela is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.
3	I've been here a few times before and the food has always been good.So, when I was in the area and hungry last night I decided to go in for some take-out rather than dining in because they were 30min away from closing.At 8:30 I show up, and the sign on the door says that they're closed but their posted hours say that they're open until 9:00. There were people inside and the door was unlocked and I was extra hungry, so I poked my head in. A server immediately just said, "We're closed." in my direction, to which I responded about the posted hours on the door. Then another server appeared and told me that they ran out of half of their food.I was compelled to ask what half, but they had already made me feel unwelcome enough. I work in a restaurant and we've limped through an entire night (up to closing) with less than half the menu, so I was pretty disappointed that they wouldn't even offer me any of what was left. I'll probably still be back, but maybe at an hour that the employees are feeling more inspired.
4	I have a confession: the food is so good that I've had lunch alone here just to eat some fresh injera. I hadn't had Ethiopian food until a few months ago when one of the owners was giving out samples at Whole Foods. He strongly encouraged me to try all the dishes he was offering that day. I'm glad I did because I liked them all! I wasn't ready to commit to buying the prepackaged lentil or wat dishes (prepackaged is a little pricy) so I picked up some injera instead. Loved it! Then I started picking up the bread from the restaurant to-go so that I could eat it with chili, soups, curries--basically everything. Finally, I went to the restaurant for lunch. Even better! The lunch and dinners specials are fantastic and everything I've had is wonderful. Order the traditional coffee if you want that something extra to make a memorable meal.
