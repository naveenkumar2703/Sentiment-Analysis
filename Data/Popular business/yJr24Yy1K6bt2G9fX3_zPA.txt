4	This tiny, unpretentious Cuban restaurant is hidden away in one of the area's many strip malls. There are a number of items ideal to share as starters, including tostones, twice-fried green plantains served with a garlic dipping sauce, and croquetas de jamon o pollo, minced ham or chicken croquettes served with a pimento aioli. Most of the entrees are served with rich black beans and rice, and you can't go wrong with either pollo Cubano, a boneless breast of chicken marinated with lime, orange and garlic and sauteed with sweet onions, or the bistec empanisado, a slender steak marinated in lime, garlic and spices, lightly breaded, and pan-fried. The portions are huge, so bring home a doggie bag for a nosh later in the night.
4	cool place... very small... the servers were very nice and let us know what to get... we tried a few tapas but I want to go back to have a full on tapas meal...like below the pollo cubano is great... but i would recommend getting a side of guac... that made it even better... for dessert get the Caribbean candy bar... it is a coconut flan with chocolate sauce and other yummies... between that and the Cuban coffee I would go back anytime...one bad thing... they make you valet... even though it is free plus tip a pain in the A, since they park the car 20 feet from the door...
5	Outstanding! A Valley Legend!This is one of my all time favorite Valley restaurants. Great food, very warm and friendly service, and great drinks. Might I suggest the Pollo Cubano or the Cho Cho. The latter may be one of the best kept secrets in Arizona.We need more restaurants like Havana!
4	A little pricey for my liking, but good nonetheless.  I really like the feel of the restaurant: part Cuban, part Puerto Rican, part Spanish, all classy.  A guitar player jammed away in a completely non-annoying way while we ate our meal and, to me, that is an accomplishment.Our Calypso Chips were outstanding.  To die for.  One of the best appetizers I can think of at the moment.  For my entree, I ordered the Ropa Vieja which was made up of the most perfectly tender beef and tasty rice with beans.  A little heavy with the peppers, however.Does anybody else think plantains smell like feet?  My date pointed this out and, although I was surprised, I'm inclined to agree.  That won't stop me from putting some into my stomach as soon as humanly possible.
4	Bring on the mojitos!  Or a pitcher of sangria. Both are terrific at Havana.  Even if you aren't interested in alcohol you are in luck. This place is worth it without the booze too.Every time I come here I am so happy. The place is usually bustling and busy, yet I never have to wait. The service is so friendly that I feel valued as a patron and the food is great.  Some of the dishes I recommend: - The salads are out of this world. All of them are a good choice. My fave involves onions, avocados and mangoes- The Cho-Cho is a great vegetarian dish. I'm a flesh eatin', animal killin' meat eater but I still enjoy this menu item- Fish! Every fishy is yummy here. The best are the Sea Bass, Shrimp and the Tilapia - The Pollo Cubana is an excellent basic chicken/rice/bean dish  - The Ropa Vieja was okay. Pretty good but not out of this world- The desserts are excellent. The coconut flan with mango sauce is my new favorite thing ever - They put limes in my diet coke. YES! Nice touch.* One word of caution: They make you valet during the weekend. Not a fan of the unnecessary (but very personable) valet. Boo!** Second word of caution: The bathrooms are outside and around the corner. Be prepared to feel like you are walking down a shady alley if you have to pee. Maybe fear of an alley attack is part of the charm. Just like in Cuba, I guess.
2	It would take a lot of mojitos and sangria to get me back to Havana Cafe anytime soon. Is the food bad? No. But Cuban food is a bit bland on my taste buds next to other foreign cuisines The San Juan Platter I had was kind of plain, and only a garlic sauce gave some of the items any taste at all. The pollo cubano was pretty much chicken soaked in lime juice and buried in sauteed onions. But those mojitos and sangria are definitely tasty, and the waiting staff is excellent. It seemed, though, a woman I guess was the owner thought a Saturday night would be a great time to conduct a rather loud discussion about marketing and operations for Havana Cafe. That sliced into the already dull atmosphere. Another complaint: Why does Havana Cafe feel the need to take up its entire front parking lot with valet parking? I'm neither too lazy to walk, not do I enjoy having strangers drive my vehicle. For a parking lot so small in a climate so mild, valet parking is just stupid. Really, if I want a fairly fancy Latin-flavored meal, I'll just head over to Asi es la Vida or Mucho Gusto Taqueria. Both restaurants are a lot more inventive, interesting and memorable.
4	i've had florida's cuban food made with love from cubans. i didn't know that some of their boats floated out to the desert in arizona. whoever their navigator was must have been drunk from salt water. though arizona should throw them a parade because they brought some awesome flavors to the land of beige from their $3 mojitos (all day on monday) to their gambas y pollo. the only major thing that was lacking on my visit was timeliness by the kitchen. we waited quite a bit for our entree; though i blame it on a large meeting held in the next room. i knew that they were busting their butts because the chefs himself brought out our food (without a "this is hot" caution). it was pipping hot enough to burn my tongue but the flavors still came through.
3	Wow, are all restaurants in Phoenix closed on Monday evenings?  After getting denied from Los Sombreros, my friend and I stumbled upon Havana Cafe.  We both ordered chicken dishes: mine with onions, peppers and rice, her's in a big metal pot.  Both were generously portions (her's especially came with almost a whole chicken), reasonably tasty, but nothing special.  The tres leches dessert was pretty good, but also nothing to write home about.They have really cheap Margarita Monday specials!
2	A party of four entered a small "Cuban Cafe" settled in between a dying strip mall. The wait service was below average. The mojitos were above average. The seafood was cooked well. But was it extremely memorable? No.The dessert sampler were pretty good for the price. But if I was in Arizona again, I'd pass on this place.
4	Max Fischer: What was your major?Rosemary Cross: I didn't have a major, but my thesis was on Latin American economic policy.Max Fischer: Oh, that's interesting. Did you hear that they're not going to teach Latin anymore?Rosemary Cross: This was more like Central America. Ha.  Okay.  That exchange doesn't have anything to do with my review of Havana Cafe, only that it dances with the South-of-the-Equator theme.  Which, in actuality, is the same concept of Havana Cafe.  That is, its a Cuban restaurant with heavy Latin American themes. First, and I must emphasize, FOREMOST, their alcohol selection is nothing short of brilliant.  They import an enormous amount of South American and European-cum-Latin influenced wines and serve it both by the ounce and the liter.  Fascinatingly, they have Portuguese reds, which i have been exhaustively looking for, either in-store or dine-in around the valley.  Praise be, I've finally found the place!  They also offer Argentine reds and whites, Chileans Sav Blancs, and Spanish Tempranillos.  Perfect selection, and VERY reasonable for their exclusivity.  Their Douro was a serf-encouraging $8.  That's not very many Escudos, no not at all.For beer, they had several unique selections, most notably the inclusion of Argentina's Quilmes.  Honestly, i cannot remember what other selections they had, though i remember being roused by the list, only to be seduced by the Porteno brew of choice.Their selection of rums, and the accompanying list of rum cocktails was also impressive, though sadly sans Havana Club Rum due to America's archaic embargo vs the snarky nation of Cuba.  Blast.When the food came out, I was impressed by the presentation.  To start, my gf found it in her gullet to order the hearts of palm/carrot/various rabbit food appetizer, which was heavily drowned in vinegar.  i liked it, but she didn't care for it all too much.  My app was the serving of 3 croquetas filled with ham with a side of mildly spicy aioli.  Not bad, but slightly mushy.  Fry them up a couple more minutes and I would have gladly accosted my taste buds with volcanic pork pieces even further.My entree was the poached chicken with shrimp and rice, which tasted well and good on the first try, but went up to 11 on the re-heat the next day.  Fucking glorious.  My gf had the stuffed squash with a Jamaican curry cream sauce.  She was thrilled with it because she likes vegetables and shit, and this was the motherload of veggie heaven -- veggies filling veggies like some plant orgy.Okay, so why the empty star?  Its pricey.  What was meant to be a casz dinner ended up surpassing the century mark.  Not a problem really, since we got 2 rounds of the good stuff, plus basically dinner/lunch out of it, but it COULD turn some people off.  All in all, i felt it was slightly over-valued. Still, this will NOT keep me from coming back.  There is just too much fucking potential here and so many unfurled selections. I've gotta take down their wine list.  I wonder if they offer an around-the-world-wine-club card like some cheesedick chain like The Yard House.  I will be here for as many happy hours and apps as is necessary to finance the country of Cuba and bypass any restrictions put onto me by the governments.  Go here and do your part too.
4	Havana Cafe has long been a family favorite.  I developed a taste for Cuban food during trips to Florida and Puerto Rico.  Sadly our government will not allow me to visit Cuba.  This is by no means the best Cuban restaurant on the planet but this is Phoenix where there are not a lot of choices.  For appetizers the Tostones are always a hit and the Maduros Fritos are good as well.  The black bean soup is well worth it.  My favorite entrees are Boliche Mechado and Picadillo.  For lunch (or dinner if you are so inclined) the Cuban sandwich, while not the equal of those from the late lamented Chary's Place, are worth the trip.We prefer the Camelback location, but used to live out in the burbs near the Greenway restaurant and found it fun and convenient, although a little more casual.  The plastic chairs on the indoor patio on Greenway are a little uncomfortable.
2	Firstly, this is Arizona turn the air conditiioning on! Normally I am not big on atmosphere, but when its 80 degrees plus outside, I expect a comfortable temperature. I had to sit outside since the inside was stuffy, and the black curtains did not do my comfort level any justice. Now that I am done ranting a bit, lets get on to the food. At this point, unfortunately, it does not get any better. We ordered the Pasteles, a tamale with pork, plantains, raisins, and spices, for an appetizer, and it was not that great. The masa was a bit dry, and the flavors weren't as scintillating as I expected, especially for the price. For our entrees we had the Ropa Veija (shredded beef in spices with black beans and rice), which once again was not anything spectacular. This was the highlight of the meal, which to me is sad. The beef was a bit tough and the moros (rice and black beans mixed) was dry. Sadly, our other entree was much worse. This title is held by the Pollo Cubano (marinated chicken breast with onions). The chicken was tender on the bright side, but it was covered with onions that were disgustingly soaked in lime. The flavor was overwhelming and I could taste nothing other than lime. Considering the price, atmosphere, and quality of Havana Cafe's food I will never return. If you must try this restaurant, I ask you to please not order the items mentioned above.
4	I visited this place about a month ago for a birthday celebration.  I started with a mojito which was pretty tasty.  We tried the plantain chips and my son had the cuban steak while I had another meat dish (which I can't remember now.)  My daughter didn't care for the plantain chips which made more for the rest of us.  We were too full for dessert so we skipped out.  It came to a little over $100.00 for five of us so I suppose that was pretty reasonable.  The restaurant was pretty quiet on Saturday afternoon, but I suspect it was hopping by evening time (oh if only I could get my family out for the nightlife!)
4	Pretty tasty Cuban food.The ropa vieja was flavorful, but a little tough.The chicken and pork were very good,Marinated in tropical and spicy flavorsThe cho-cho (chayote in Spanish) was excellentThe sauce tasted a lot like Hollandaise sauce though? (Strange)Service was very attentive.I would gladly eat here again!
3	Never been to Cuba, but I really respect its food.  The food is filled with flavors really brining the Cuban culture to through its food.  This is a traditional ma and pa restaurant that can open your eyes to new flavors.
5	I've been to each of the three locations of Havana Cafe and have never been disappointed. The food is always delicious and I had the best mojitos I've ever had at Havana Cafe. It can be a bit pricey, but the food is definitely worth it.
5	What more can I say that the other reviewers haven't already said? Havana Cafe is fantastic! I believe I may have been Cuban in a former life because I absolutely love the flavors of Cuban cooking. And, going to this restaurant somehow makes me feel like I'm right at home. The food is comforting to me -- delicious black beans & rice, unbelievably tasty maduros fritos and wonderfully scrumptious pollo cubano and chicharrones de pollo!The atmosphere is great too.  You feel like you've escaped the desert and been transported to a cool tropical Caribbean hideaway. It's very laid back, low-key and unstuffy, yet they offer a very inviting and classy dinning experience. Their lunch menu is much more affordable than their dinner one, but even then the prices are decent for an awesome meal with great atmosphere. Havana Cafe will always be my favorite place to go for great Caribbean cuisine.
5	Love Havana Cafe! I used to travel to Florida monthly for work and got a little spoiled (and addicted) by the great cuban food selection. HC isn't on par with some of those places, but it's darn good and it's the best Cuban food I've found in Phoenix.The flavors are fresh and robust. Personal favorites are the Pollo Cubano (chicken marinated in citrus, onion, and lime), the Arroz con Pollo (chicken with safron rice, chorizo, and asparagus-with other yummy stuff), and the Paradise Pulled Pork (with onions, sweet peppers, and habaneros).  The Ropa Vieja and Cho Cho are good choices too, but they aren't my favorites. My absolute favorite thing at Havana are the Completas. These are full meals for 4 to 6 people (depending on your appetite) that are packed up and waiting for you to take home and enjoy in comfort. There are several selections (http://www.havanacafe-az.com/recipes/index.php) priced between 29.95 and 34.95. Each meal comes with your choice of entree and Moros (black beans & rice cooked together)Cuban Cabbage SaladMaduros (sweet, fried plantains)Freshly baked Cuban BreadChocolate Bread or Rice PuddingYou can call anytime during the day and order up your choice with a pick up time. IT"S FREAKIN GREAT!!!As others have mentioned, the mojitos are fabulous and luckily for us, they have been kind enough to publish their recipe http://www.havanacafe-az.com/recipes/index.phpService at Havana can be a little slow, but that's very true to it's cuban roots. Food is an event in this culture and is to be relished... not rushed. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the gastric ride.
4	Three locations??  I'll have to look into that, I've been to the one on Bell and the one on Camelback and a great time was had by all on both occasions! I got hooked on Cuban food whilst visiting the sister in law down in Florida many years back.  I've not had a Cuban sandwich that rivals those on South Beach here in Phoenix, not like that's any big surprise...Havana Cafe is about as good as it gets in the Valley.  And thankfully they actually do a pretty good job!Try thier paella next time, I thoroughly enjoy their version.
5	One of my favorite things to do is go hike the echo canyon side of camelback and then cruise down the hill to Havana Cafe. The best mojito in Phoenix hands down no arguments please! The black bean fritters, o my holy ****! So good! Everything on the menu here is very well done. I have a good amount of Cuban food and this is one of my all time favorite spots. Good ethnic food is hard to come by in the Southwest and this place sets a good example. Heads up ladies, This place is full of Latin charm so go with your girls and your drinks will be nice and strong!
5	First, I'd like to send a shout-out to Irma, our server who has given me hope that there are caring hospitable people in the food industry.  Irma receives 5 stars for taking good care of me and my sweetheart during our recent date at the Havana Cafe. Way to go Irma!We step into a well packed restaurant on a Friday night with plans to try the Sailor's Paella Special and a few cocktails. We wait for just a few seconds until we are greeted by Irma and her warm smile and are led to our table. Our cocktail orders are taken immediately, 1 Mojito and 1 White Sangria. Both exceeded our expectations and were just thing to get our date started.The ambiance is whimsical and charming - Reminded me of the movie "The Bird Cage" without the drag queens and dramatic dialogue. Bummer!Now on to the Paella. It was the perfect dish for the evening offering plenty of shrimp, calamari, crab, scallops, muscles, tuna and a healthy serving of saffron rice. This meal also requires a little handy work to get to the crab and muscles but you are given the proper instruments to do so. This may not be the best choice for those who do not enjoy this kind of food activity but we had a lot of fun with it.  We will be back soon to try another interactive meal and partake of a round or two of Mojitos. So if you are in the mood for something different, fun, and oh so delicioso, I recommend you try a night out at the Havana Cafe. I also hope you have the pleasure of meeting a groovy gal who goes by the name Irma.
5	I love the food here!!! usually get the Pollo Cubano which is delicious. I also like getting the Plantanes (look at the pictures, it's the one with the fried bananas) the bean dip is out of this world! i usually take my friends here to eat and they all seem to like it. this is also a nice place to take that special someone out on a lovely date. it's relaxing and the valet parking makes it seem like you're a million bucks. hahaha
2	I really wanted to like this place.  The people were friendly and the service was good, but the food was bland.  Pretty small and dark inside the bar area was practically noexistent.  Nevertheless, had to try the mojito.  So-so and have had better.  Also, the food looked and tasted like cafeteria food.  If you've ever eaten in Miami or S. Florida you will sorely be disappointed with the selections here.  I left questioning whether I went on an off-night.
4	"Its like im on vacation! "said Nathan as we were waiting to get our food. "It is... I could use the sounds of the ocean though" then Nathan replies with, "im just replacing the traffic sounds with ocean sounds" Good stuff man! Nice outdoor seating and lighting, also the heatlamp was effing awesome! it really does have the remote feel, I felt like I was far far away... instead I was only a block from my place. The food... holy good god... this shit is awesome. I got some chicken dish with a great orangish, spicy-ish sauce which was unreal. I cant wait to try a few other items on the menu. The service was nothing to write home about, but who gives a shit with this type of food and atmosphere.
4	I go here all the time and I love it!  Such great ambiance for such a little place, always cozy and fun to stop in here for a bite.  The tapas are all perfectly spicy or fruity or whatever they want them to be - I usually order a variety every time I go.  The ceviche is great on hot days.  Also a big fan of the repollo relleno.  The desserts are awesome as well, especially the guava empanadas (just let them cool down before you bit into them!).  I don't usually order the meals, but when I have, they have been very good.  I am definitely more a fan of just ordering a bunch of tapas.  Also, great mojitos and sangria!  Very cute and pleasant place.  Great service, very friendly people.
5	This restaurant is consistently one of our favorites and we ALWAYS take company there when we have them in town.  The menu is imaginative and fresh!  The staff is very helpful and prompt.  You must have the Calypso chips when you go.  The Carribean Candy Bar for dessert is definately shareable.  Try it!!!
5	I love Havana Cafe. I lunch with my grandma here once a month. We meet up before the lunch rush, right when they open at 11:30am. The pollo cubano is all I've ever ordered. It's soooooo good that I don't feel the need to try anything else. The pollo cubano comes with black beans, rice and plantains. The carmelized onions on top of the chicken are sweet and divine.
5	If people in heaven eat, Havana Cafe is doing the catering. We had dinner here last night. When we first walked in, the decor and the plastic chairs were a bit off-putting, given the menu isn't exactly full of budget meals. But we quickly got over that when the Capirinhias arrived. The food: Potage de Frijoles Negros- hands down the best black bean soup i've ever had. I could easily eat just this for days. Pollo Cubano- The chicken and onions are very citrusy, and the meat is tender. You really have to like onions to fully appreciate this dish. Three stars.Gallina Frita- Fantastic. The shredded chicken was full of flavor, and the onions and spices complemented each other perfectly. The rice and beans that come with this dish are different (Moros) than the standard, and they are wonderful. The dish also comes with plantains, which are good, if you like plantains. Five stars.Chicharrones de Pollo- I wasn't a big fan of this one. It's fried chicken, but it had a very odd flavor from the citrusy marinade. I guess I am too ingrained in my ways regarding fried chicken because this just didn't do it for me. Another strange thing about this dish is the chicken itself- rather than having a leg or a thigh, the fried chicken pieces were the meat pieces used for making chicken wings. Two stars.Bistecs Cubanos (Encevollado style) - I don't like beef. This steak, however, is probably the one beef dish I could eat with abandon. The meat is pounded thin and smothered with onions. Five stars, because I hate beef, and I loved this. Pudin de Pan con Helado- I tend to shy away from bread pudding because of the usually disgusting consistency. We ordered this on a recommendation from the server, though, and it was fantastic. Chocolate bread pudding with chocolate chips....yum. Top it with ice cream and you've made a great thing even better. Four stars. We didn't try anything from the tapas menu, or any of the other entrees that sound delicious. We'll definitely be back.
4	Haven't been to the Havana Cafe in years.  Forgot all about it until a friend suggested that we have lunch there.  The service was great and so was the food.  Can't remember what the name of the entree was that I ordered, but it was spicy shredded beef with  two skewers of grilled zucchini and mushrooms and plantains as well .... all very good!  I will put Havana Cafe on the rotation of lunch time spots!
2	This is w/out a doubt the worst food I've had since I've been living in Phoenix.I gave it 2 stars, because the service was great, although the constant refilling of my water was getting a bit annoying. The food is not authentic, I had the Puerto Rican combo, which none of the food on there was even worth eating, while the hubby ate some traditional Cuban food, which was traditional tasting. Wont be going here or recommending this place to anyone, unless they're thirsty.
2	I am hesitant to write this review seeing all the glorious write ups before me. I came for lunch today and was very disappointed. I ordered the tapas trio and 30 minutes later the server came over to tell me they were out of the sauce for the meatballs and the chef did not want to make a substitution. Not a big deal, but 30 minutes was quite a while to wait to be told to order something else. On the servers suggestion I ordered the pollo cubano, it came out very, very dry. It was covered in a citrus sauce that was decent, but even with the sauce and marinated onions on top the chicken was barely edible. My friend ordered Arroz con Pollo and the chicken was just as dry, I didn't taste any chorizo and the asparagus was overcooked to a mush.The sangria was pretty good and had a subtle rose taste.. I'd return just for it.Like I said with so many good reviews perhaps this was just an off day. I'll certainly go back and give them another try, hopefully with an updated review to follow.
4	The Hubbs took me here for Valentine's dinner. At first glance the place is a little strange - nice table settings...plastic chairs?? Really pricey...plastic chairs? Anyhow, the service was great and the food wasn't too shabby either. We ordered the black bean fritters for an appetizer (OMG YUM!!!!) and a couple of drinks. The drinks were strong, but good. Hey more for your money, right? I ordered the Cuban pot roast and the Hubbs ordered the Chayote Curry Squash. Honestly, I could have just eaten 23782 orders of Black Bean fritters and been okay. My pot roast had a good flavor, but the meat was so completely overdone I almost contemplated sending it back (we were late for a show). The Hubbs' dish was good, a little on the sweet side, but I guess that's Cuban food for ya. Oh - we found the squash sticker in the rice...the manager was nice about it, but didn't say sorry or offer anything (not that we expected it, it's not like it was a fingernail). Dessert on the other hand was heavenly. Absolutely heavenly. I had the bread pudding (OMG OMG OMG) and the Hubbs ordered the papaya pastry. SO GOOD. Next time I think I'll skip the entrees altogether and just go for drinks, apps, and dessert. I'll be back, either way.
5	If you want to go to Havana Cafe, follow my lead:I can't break the delicious habit of starting with a mango rum mojito or sangria depending on my mood. No need to order "dinner." Chose 3 tapas... I'll pick two and you can pick ONE. I pick the papa rellena ($6.50) potato croquettes about the size of a tennis ball (one for each of us) filled with ground beef and topped with a delicious lime cilantro sauce (Yes, I used the words delicious and cilantro in the same sentence! Me! The girl who HATES cilantro!!) and the black bean fritters (frituras de frijoles negres $5.25), little poppers accompanied by a scrumptious calypso avocado dip that is laced with either sour cream or cream cheese or both! The third item is your choice. Finish it off with a Cuban coffee (a sweetened shot of espresso) and possibly, depending on willpower or lack thereof, the Caribbean candy bar - coconut flan topped with a rum fudge sauce and toasted almonds. Truly, this is the best way to enjoy Havana Cafe!
2	I have been here a couple of times and just not written a review for this location. Last time was great everything we ordered was delicious and fresh, this time not so much, at least as my food was concerned. On a recent rip to California I visited a Cuban bakery and cafe where I had the most amazing potato balls, that's what they call them there, a mashed potato croquet slightly larger than a golf ball, filled with seasoned ground beef and flash fried and Oh SO Amazing and only .80cents each! WHAT! ;-) So when I saw Christina's review describing these fabulous treats I wondered how I over looked them and decided to make my way over to Havana. I have to say I was extremely disappointed, 2 golf ball sized, dried out potato balls for $6.50! (see pics)They were not even edible in my opinion.  I asked the waiter to take them away.I also ordered the calamari (see pics)which I was not happy with either but since someone in my party kept eating it, it was a little hard to send back. It was very heavy if that makes sense, the crust was so thick and I though it was a tad rubbery but what turned me off the most was the grayish greenish color...........I wasn't going to eat these either.
4	I went here for lunch the other day and I was surprised i hadn't heard of this place sooner. It was great. The bread was delicious, service and ambiance were superb and the pork sandwich I had was amazing. Everything was seasoned just right and I left feeling very full. It is too bad I had to go to work after because there specialty drinks and import drafts looked great. I will go back for dinner very soon.
5	I've been to each of the three locations and I always leave even more certain that Havana Cafe has earned its spot on my top ten favorite restaurants in Phoenix list.  First time you go, go for tapas - it's a wonderful way to try a little of everything.  And if you have the opportunity to order ANYTHING that comes with banana guava ketchup, DO IT.  I typically dont even like ketchup but... wow.
3	As a big fan of Cuban food I couldn't help but stop in here.  My husband and I lived in Florida and Cuban food is either dressy or takeout on the corner but it's all AMAZING.  Since moving to Arizona we have missed our weekly fix and so went on a splurge here.  The dress code threw us for a loop a little, but they didn't kick us out for my having a tank top on so I can't complain too much.  The menu was good, we both had a tough time picking stuff out, but eventually did settle on the pulled pork and the picadillo.  The food was very very good, but the price was outrageous compared to Florida.  I guess that's what competition buys you, lower prices.We did like the guitar music, it was high enough to be heard, but not so loud that we were drowned out.  We won't return often, but we will return when the craving strikes us especially hard.
3	We tried Havana Cafe last night for the first time... Without mojitos or sangria, perhaps we didn't get the full experience, so I'll have to return for those and sit inside next time too.  But it was a beautiful night, so our party chose outside instead.  Irma was our server (see Robert M's review).  She was fabulous.  We started with a variety of empanadas and the black bean fritters.  I was not a fan of the 'calypso avocado dip' that comes on the side of the fritters - it reminded me of store bought guacamole that is so creamy, it doesn't even taste like avocado.  The fritters themselves were alright and same with the empanadas.  Next course was chorizo, fish of the day (halibut), and sides of yucca con mojo and asparagus.  I'm a huge yucca fan, so it's always a treat for me when I go to a Cuban restaurant... and it delivered at Havana!  Yum... gotta love that interesting texture!All in all a pleasant experience - I will return with a larger party sometime for the real deal!  Thanks again to Irma for taking good care of us!
2	I'm sadly disappointed with Havana Cafe.  I ordered the Pollo Ajillo over steamed rice with maduros.  The chicken was over-salted and had a lot of fat.  The rice tasted like something that was microwaved.  It was as if it was a frozen meal which was then plated and heavily salted. The maduros were ok.I could barely get thru a few bites and felt bad when the hostess asked if she could box up the rest for me and I had to decline.   I'm not one to turn away from salt.  In fact, I''ve been known to add more salt to my food for taste.  So when I couldn't even handle this plate of food, it came as quite a surprise.  I would give Havana Cafe one star but I had a very attentive hostess, so I give Havana 2 stars because of the kind service.
5	Cute little restaurant, very cramped, but I feel like that is how it should be.  On a hot day, I almost feel like I am in Cuba.  They have a diverse menu, so you are sure to find something for everyone.  This doesn't seem like the ideal place to have a dinner date, but so far I have only had hits with this place.  Everyone I've taken here has loved that food and commented on how cute the restaurant is.  Mmmm...thinking about croquettes is making me crave some Havana Cafe.
1	This place is a huge dissapoinment. You look at the menu and you get excited thinking. Oh this is going to be good!!!  Then the food comes and is wrong. Very wrong. The rice is wet and salty. Too much cilantro all over the place. This is not Mexican is Cuban. Yes we use cilantro on our food but not to that level. Rice should not be soup.  Bad cooking period.
4	Its Cuban and fun.  Where else are you going to get Cuban food?
5	OMG. If you're afraid of flavor stay away because this place has the market cornered. Papa Rellena ,one of my favorites. But my absolute top pick so far is the Gallina Frita. Its just perfect. But there is soo much to choose from. The Paella seems to be a huge hit on Friday nights when it's only $20. Oh and if you want a potent drink that will make you giggly but not sloppy. "Pussy's Painkiller" Yeah.. I know..its fun just to order it.
4	Been going to Havana for years! I've eaten almost everything on the menu, and most everything is delicious! My favorites are the black bean dip with plantain chips, cuban steak with sauteed onions with rice and black beans (I prefer the rice with beans on top, rather than cooked together), marisco zarzuela, paella, hearts of palm salad, and the plain flan (best consistency and creamy!). We always have a pitcher of sangria, too! Service and friendliness is hit and miss.
5	Super friendly place with a great little atmosphere.  Cute and quaint and sometimes they have live music which isn't too overbearing but it is a small place.  The first time we ate here, we were back within a week with out of town guests and have since taken several couples there.  The menu is overwhelming, it's so huge.  There is something for everyone on there.  And out of the five times I've eaten there, not one disappointment.  The food is amazing.  Be warned it's in enormous quantities!  You will take some home and you will be happy to eat it a second time no doubt.  I cannot say enough about how friendly the service is and how much they care about your experience.  I never knew cuban food was so tasty either till I tried this place.  Get a pitcher of Sangria too.   I must do if you are in the area.
4	Yum. Yum. YumWent there for lunch today and was a bit iffy because we were the only people there. Granted, it was 11:45 am and just before the lunch crowd. We were pleasantly greeted by Diana (I think that was her name) but she was SUPER nice. While we looked over the menu, we had delicious black bean fritters served with an avocado dip. My friend had a cup for the pumpkin bisque and I got to have a taste. BEST soup ever. The ginger in the soup gave it a spicy kick. While my friends ordered Cuban pressed sandwiches, I tried the Pechuga Rellana: a chicken breast stuffed with mashed plaintains, black beans and rice and a caramelized plantain mash on the side. It was love at first bite. The rice was perfectly seasoned, the caramelized plantains were highly addictive. I wish I saved room for dessert but I'm coming back to have dessert and saving my fifth star for that!Oh yeah- on Monday nights, they serve up paella! I'm in!
4	So I returned another time for dinner and was unfortunately... disappointed. I tried the mojito and it was 'ok' but not for nearly $9. Also, the dinner menu is everything on the lunch menu plus $5- $10 for each plate. This time I tried the Chicharonnes de Pollo and it was horribly dry. I ate one piece. My brother had a mango glazed chicken dish and it was not good either. Too sweet. I still love this place but just disappointed in the dinner prices and my selection. I will be going again but for lunch next time.
4	The black beans and rice could just as well become my staple food in this crap economy.  Rounded out with exceptionally good maduros fritos it's a peasant meal, when I don't want to splurge.Caribbean at it's most relaxed.
5	If you want to have a lovely little evening I recommend Havana Cafe. It's a little bit different (for me at least) so it's nice to try new things. Plus it's really tasty. They have mojitos there that are to die for - not your standard "mix" drink, a REAL mojito.  There was live music the night I went which was great. It was just one of those meals where you could take your time and enjoy the whole experience. Totally recommend it.It's only spendy because you want to do it up - appetizers, drinks, meals, desert, coffee...all together it adds up but the meals themselves aren't outrageous.
4	This is my favorite Tapas joint in town. It's a place I have to get the same thing everytime and maybe more to try a few new items... my must haves are:Island Gingered Yam & Pumpkin Bisque Soup (Seasonal)... so good and the fact that it's seasonal makes it even more of a special treat.Camarones Al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp)... this is my all time favoreite dish thus far @ Havana... I can eat it as my meal as long as they provide me as much of their tasty bread as I need to sop the dish dry of all the yummy garlic sauce it contains.Maduras Fritos... Fried plantains... need I say more?Mojito... best in town in terms of authenticity.Marquesas de Chocolate aka Chocolate Pate... I never cared for dessert here until I tasted this strangely named treat. It is so rich at first you think it will be too little but then you realize you need to share with everyone at your table.Other worthy options: Arroz Con Pollo... It has baby peas in it and I really don't like peas... but I like them in this dish! I got to try this dish because a friend ordered it as his meal and didn't even make a dent in it... so I got all the leftovers and it was pretty tasty and economical!Fritoras de Frijoles Negros... I've never had Black Bean Fritters before--they are quite tasty dipped in Guacamole!Calypso Chips...A thinner more chippy version of Fried Plantains.Sun Spots... Sweet Potato Fritters pretty tasty as well... for a fried root vegetable!Datiles Con Chorizo... A meatier appetizer... not the best I've had but pretty darn good.Empanaditas... These are alright... though I'm partial to Filipino style Empanadas... but since I have no place to buy them from, nor have I mastered making them, these are quite good for a band-aid craving.Tamal Cubano... pretty tasty, but my fave is the soupier Salvadorean take on the chicken tamale.Flan... haven't had it, but flan consistency throughout varying cultures seems pretty consistent.Free Goodness: Their Bread! It's just the way I like it, hot, thin and crisp crust and soft in the middle!As you can see, outside of the Arroz Con Pollo, I have not tried many of their entrees... I'm quite content to dine with others and share Havana's wonderful tapas... but one day I WILL try their Paella. A vegetarian friend said they make a veggie paella that was pretty tasty... and she loves their Mojitos just as much as I do so I think she may be right on this one. Can't wait to try it... with a side of Camarones al Ajillo and a Mojito!
4	I drove right past Havana Cafe on the first attempt.  We banged a left & pulled a U-ey to get back to it.  When we walked up the patio had just a couple tables going.  When we glanced inside we could see it was filled nearly to capacity.  Havana Cafe is not a very big place but they have really worked it to fit every possible table.We started with a special-three appetizers for about $9.50.  I would tell you the names of all the appetizers but I can only find one of them on the menu I brought home.  It came with some meatballs in a brown gravy.  The meatballs looked like Swedish meatballs and the gravy looked like standard brown gravy.  Looks can be deceiving.  The meatballs had a nice texture and the gravy was surprisingly complex in it's flavor notes.  The appetizer trio also came with a pastry kind of similar to spanakopita but crispier and thicker.  The last appetizer was papa rellena-large croquettes filled with beef picadillo.  They were smothered in a creamy cilantro-lime sauce.The entree we shared...Pescado Al Hinojo - fish fillet & jumbo shrimp pan seared and topped with a flavorful and creamy sauce with nice notes of lime, fennel and white wine.  It came with a white rice.  All delicious.I finished off with a cafe cubano.  Perfect capper to the meal.I am looking forward to a return trip to Cafe Havana.  Deciding what to order here is torture.  Everything sounds wonderful and the whole time you are trying to decide you are being bombarded by heady smells of food from surrounding tables.
4	Last night I was going through some of my gift certificates (Groupon) and wanted to find somewhere new to eat half-way between Litchfield Park and Gilbert....we landed at Havana Cafe in Phoenix.   I missed it at first and had to turn around, it is somewhat hidden and unexpected.  Service was fantastic!   While we had one main server, there were two others that were constantly available to help us out.    I ate Cuban food in Miami once several years ago and have a general understanding of it, but wasn't sure what to expect here.    We ordered a few appetizers - the fried Plantain Chips and the sweet Potato Chips.  Both were great - so great in fact that we ordered more and had to share some entrees.    The best thing I tasted there was the Guava-Banana-Ketchup dip for the sweet potato fries.....YUMMY!  I wish I could have the recipe!    We also tried the Pumpkin soup (my second favorite thing I tasted), the Cuban Meatloaf, the Cuban Sandwich, a Pork Tamal, and the Black Beans & Rice.  My son had kids fried shrimp which was also pretty good for a kids meal.  All were very very good!The prices were higher than I expected, but worth it.This restaurant is a gem - I LOVED it!    I will absolutely visit again.  There are many items on the menu that I want to try...perhaps I'll visit a few more times, and experiment at the Chandler location which is closer to me.
5	Great food, I can't complain other than I wanted more food....hehe!
5	This is a regular stop for us when we're in Phoenix -- the food is simply awesome!  Everything is excellent.  This last trip we went with another couple and had the plantains, the sun spots (sweet potato fries) and the Tamal Cubano (a tamale w/ corn, pork tidbits and sofrito) as apps, and I had the Masas de Puerco Fritas as an entree ("Morsels of marinated tender pork fried to a golden brown. Served with black beans and rice"; one of their more expensive items at $21.95).  I also had a mojito, which was very good (and big) as usual.For desert we had the Caribbean Candy Bar ("Coconut flan topped with rum fudge sauce, candied coconut and toasted almonds"), the Pudin de Pan con Chocolate ("Warm chocolate bread pudding studded with Ghirardelli chocolate chips served with a rum fudge sauce and whipped cream") and a sponge cake drizzled with chocolate and raspberry sauce.  All super good.Run, don't walk, to Havana Cafe!
2	i usually get annoyed when i see people review a thai restaurant and give lower stars because neither the owners, nor customers, nor servers, nor anyone is thai. you've seen these reviews cause in my head, if the food and service are good, why should i give a shit who is serving it to me. the whole debate about authenticity is one i find annoying on several levels.. so, first, no, i am not giving them two stars cause the guy who served us was the blondest gringo (with passable though arrogant spanish) with a haircut i don't know the name for but would describe as a mini bowl cut/possibly a shelf cut. his service was SHITTY, which definitely has something to do with the low stars. and it certainly doesn't help that i had to listen to him ask the waiter in spanish, which he assumed i didnt speak, maybe 7 times if the cheesy convertible out front was ours but then i had to listen to him talk about convertibles with another table for ten minutes. that may have something to do with the star takeway.i actually could have heard the guitarist sing guantanemera 8 more times than listen to the waiter/possible owner talk about cars to the neighboring table. that is a big statement for me as my nipples usually invert for minimum 48 hours every time guantanemera is played anywhere within a 17 mile radius.the most obvious reason for the 2 star rating is the food. it sucked shit. it did not taste that it was freshly cooked in any way. there was a film over teh meatball sauce that had to be broken several times for the moat of semi-warm liquid to emerge. everythin was severely underwhelming and lacked flavor.specifically, these items, in addition to tiny meatballs in a bowl of lukewarm sauce (that the mother, bless her, was a fan of) would be...empanadita trio (we had the beef-BLAND)some kind of black bean ball- the only reason this place didnt get one star is that the avocado dip for said BBball was tasty. this has to do with my undying love for the avocado rather than their particular dipspanish tortilla- the worst i think ive ever had, and i spent 5 years as a poor tortilla eater in spain and argentina in  between english teachin gigs when they came as free tapas.the best thing here was probably the bread, they brought it warm.  our other favorite was some kind of cheese spinach thing that i would put more in the greek family. wasn't bad.all in all, this place was, mas o menos, mierda
5	Seriously, my favorite place in the entire Valley.  Fabulous food in a casual environment.  Excellent service, great drink menu.  Every time i eat here, i rave about the food.  I usually have the Pollo Cubano.  Its simply delicious.  An entree is about $20.  And worth every penny!
5	When you go: try the black bean fritters with avocado dipping sauce---SOOOO GOOD...i could've eaten those for my whole lunch!Then, my friend and I shared two different dishes: the Cuban sandwich (like a panini), which came with the black bean soup and a pork dish that was marinated in lime juice and spices.Both dishes were really good! i would definitely go back, because EVERYTHING on the menu looked tasty. i wanted to try it all, but alas, my stomach and wallet are only so big.
4	A Midwest girl's Cuban haven.I went here twice Valentine's Day weekend. 5 stars for the mojitos. 5 stars for the Black Bean Fritters. 5 stars for the service.Very casual, cozy environment. I'll be back here the next time I'm in town.
5	So after driving by this place for a few years always wanting to try it out I finally did.  I am so thankful reading the yelp reviews helped my decision to finally try this place out cause it is some of the best cuban food I've ever had.  For starters I got the calypso chips which are fried plantain chips and a black bean dip.  So awesome I could have just had that.  I also got this brazilian sugar cane drink with lime juice that was a twist on a mojito and it was awesome.  For my entree I got the Boliche Mechado which is a Cuban pot roast stuffed with Spanish chorizo and simmered in a red wine sauce. Served with spicy potatoes which also were just excellent.  I am a huge chorizo fan so when I saw this on the menu I knew it was the choice.  I was too full for dessert so I couldn't try any of the amazing selections that were on the menu but I will be back for that for sure.  Also they have paella which I must go back for cause it had chorizo, scallops, clams, and mussles.  Sounds delicious.  Thanks again yelp for another push to try a local hot spot.
2	Okay so last night 6 of us came here for dinner. Its the 3rd time I have been to this location. The first time I thought it was AMAZING. Couldnt get enough of it. 2nd time was "ok", my drink (Pussy's Pain Killer) tasted off, not like the first visit and the food was somewhat bland. Chalked it off to being an off night. So last night I ordered a dish I had at the Bell Rd location which was phenomenal-Gallina Fritta. Last night it was almost dry, bland, you couldnt even taste the garlic or lime. So disappointing. My Pussy's Pain Killer tasted better but not even close to the "wow" factor the first time I had it. For this I dont think I will ever return, its far from consistent and has changed from "Amazing" to "meh" in 3 years time. Its time to find a new Cuban/Puerto Rican restaurant to get my fix.As for the service..our server was extremely pleasant but scattered. He took appetizer orders from 4 of us and completely forgot to ask the other 2 at the table! Then the same 2.. their food entrees didnt even come out within 5 minutes of the rest of us.?? It is not a big restaurant and we were not a big party, so there was no reason for the service to be sub par.In the poetic stylings of Guns -n-Roses." I used to love her...ooh yeah.. but I had to kill her"..is my final word on this place.
5	Easily the best Cuban Food I have ever had. I can't remember what my dish was called, but it was pulled pork and peppers with rice on the side. Also, they serve Pusser's Painkillers, a drink that has a special place in my heart. Anyone who has ever been to the Soggy Dollar in the British Virgin Islands will understand.It was so good that We went there twice on our vacation. The service was great and the patio was an excellent spot to relax on a nice spring night.
3	My boyfriend and I recently purchased a Groupon for Havana Cafe since I've been wanting to take him there for quite some time. It was a $15 groupon for $35 worth of food, a pretty good deal! We were excited. We sat down for an early dinner, around 6pm. Using the term greeted would be generous, so I'll just say that an older man came to our table and set 2 waters down without saying hello or how are you or anything. It's a small restaurant but there were only about 3 other tables with patrons in the restaurant. 15 minutes later he comes back with menus and asks if we want anything else to drink, I say just water for now because we had just gotten the wine menu. He proceeds to take our drink menus so I ended up just sticking with water. Finally, another waitress comes to take our food order. I show her the groupon to make sure it's okay to use it on that time and day (a lot of places won't let you use them during happy hour). She looks at it strangely and just walks off with it? She looked really annoyed. We got our Black Bean Fritters and Calamari appetizers. Both were so amazing. We were really blown away. For our main entree we ordered the seafood paella which was equally amazing, if not better. Although my boyfriend who has had paella on many occasions, thought it needed more saffron. I thought it was just fine. The seafood was really fresh and I think more saffron would have drowned out other flavors. We ordered the mini caramel flan for dessert. It came out maybe 2 minutes after we ordered it so it's by no means fresh or prepared. I thought the caramel on it was bitter and I didn't finish it. Overall, the food here is amazing, definitely worth going for. I was really disappointed by the service. The staff seemed to be annoyed with our groupon usage which made me feel uncomfortable. The place itself is pretty quaint and nice. It doesn't seem very popular with younger people but maybe that's because of the service.
2	Wanted to use my Groupon, and they were closed for renovation! Not sure how long that will last, but you may want to call first if you are thinking of going soon. Will update when I can actually go!
3	I'm glad I tried my wife's dish because I wasn't having a great introduction to this restaurant and it was somewhere down in 1.5 to 2* territory. It's easy to get carried away in a sea of red stars sometimes but maybe 2 mojitos or more carry the reviews skyward? :)  Actually the  drink/ appetizer part was really nice  Mojitos, chorizo and maduros. Appetizers aren't gargantuan,usually a good thing,and are good value. I could see us coming back for just these. The mojito was not as good as  those made by a co-worker who'd attended the classes they run here, weird;) but still pretty serviceable. The Rabo Encendido ( oxtail stew) I ordered  could have come from England it was that bland  the shopping list of spices that most recipes have in common for this had taken Labour day off.  really it was boiled meat on white rice with nothing other than the maduros providing the taste. I borrowed some of the sauce from the other dish to finish it as well as the amazingly tasteful black beans that accompanied her dish so it's not like they can't cook, just not consistently.     2.5  rounded up to 3.
3	I came here with Jim and Audrey W for the first time tonight and it was pretty good.  I've seen a few reviews for this place, so I was glad to try it out.I admit, I don't have a lot of exposure to cuban food.  I found this place to be quite authentic in my book...not your usual corporate stuff, thats for sure.  Very intimate with staff that really seems to know what thier doing.I wasnt all that hungry and wanted to get something light, so I stuck with an appitizer.  I cant remember the name of what I ordered becuase it was in spanish and I could not pronounce it, but it was good.  Jims dish looked really good, and Audrey had some fish.  Every one was happy.Beverages were always topped off and I enjoyed my experience here.  I found it to be on the pricy side, so it was good that I didnt have much of an appetite.  I wasnt looking to spend a lot of money and really didnt want a forklift full of food, which is what they seem to serve here.  On the lighter side, they seem to have an amazing menu with LOTS to choose from!Very impressive.A good time was had by all, and if you like Cuban food, go here!
3	I came here for the second time last night.  Audrey W and I met Amy B for dinner.I opted for the special and kind of regret it.  It was a seafood paella.  I have to remind myself sometimes that I don't live by the ocean anymore and very few restaurants here in the valley provide good quality seafood dishes along the lines of the paella.It was mediocre and I know many other things I have had at Havana Cafe are much better.:-( I'll just have to bank on my upcoming dinner at Wildfish for Restaurant Week to set me right.  I'm having the cioppino.I used to order things like cioppino or "Fruite de Mare" all the time when I lived in Boston and I always enjoyed it.  Two times ordering that sort of thing at restaurants in Phoenix and :-(  Lesson learned.
1	So this is heartbreaking.  I've been going to Havana cafe for years and over looked a lot as far as decor and service, but once the food goes... So do I.  A friend who used to live here, who was visiting, suggested Havana cafe for dinner since it was always great.  Our food was not good.  It was ok at BEST and our service was lack luster- snotty really.  Then they cleared our plates before we were done and started to vacuum while we were still eating. If we were the only people keeping them there late, which it was NOT LATE AT ALL (and we weren't the only patrons there)  I could understand, but overall the service was poor right out the gate and our food wasn't great, So we will not be going back, which breaks my heart. Since I've had many good experiences in the past. I always knew I was paying more, but I figured it was worth it, but I don't think $400 for 5 people was worth that kind of poor service.  ESPECIALLY since SO many places are closing up these days.
2	If you ever tried "real Cuban food" you will be disappointed at the lack of taste and the mundane appearance of the food. The food is overpriced, the tamales are awful, nothing like Cuban tamales at all. The local is poorly decorated,  and you need to bring a butt cushion to make your sitting experience a bit more pleasant on those plastic patio chairs. The service was below average, and one of the waitress could not find a way to smile. Really disappointing. Now the goods. Extensive menu, with many legitimate named cuban dishes, may be you will find something good, their name evokes that mysticism and curiosity we have about beautiful Havana,  and,  many people have never tried real cuban food so the restaurant will survive.
4	I visited today with a friend & we were both very pleased with our dinner. We shared an appetizer of Calypso Chips which are fried plantain chips with black bean dip. I honestly wanted to lick the dip bowl, lol. I saved some room for the Pollo Cubano, which seemed like it would be a simple dish. Chicken, beans & rice. It was simply delicious. The chicken was moist & tasted of citrus & the beans & rice had a tang to them (not hot or spicy, just tasty). My friend had the ox tail, something I'd never had nor had I ever really wanted, lol, but I tasted it & it was very yummy. For desert we shared a small coconut flan with citrus sauce. It was good but very rich & filling. I washed it all down with a glass of the Veniterra - pinot grigio - Argentina wine. The entire meal was great, the staff were very friendly & helpful. The location is simple, but I went there for the food, not cushy seats & I did love the live guitar music. It was a little pricier than I'd expected, but the servings are big. Next time I'll go for lunch!
3	I had the pleasure of eating here when I first moved to Arizona almost a year ago, my date insisted on bringing me to his fav restaurant. This quaint place has lots of character and was perfect for a date; as soon as we pulled up I got excited to experience some authentic Cuban food. I started off with the red sangria, it was very tasty and not too sweet like some I've tasted. For my entree I ordered the arroz con pollo and when they brought it out I was immediately happy that I ordered it. The chicken was seasoned perfectly and the saffron rice and white asparagus were all perfectly cooked. The portions were huge, after eating a good amount at the restaurant I still had enough for a meal at home. I will be back soon enough to try some more good eats off their menu!
4	I'd been craving Cuban food ever since I left Florida, and I couldn't have been more thrilled after our meal at Havana Cafe.  I wouldn't sit inside, as the atmosphere kind of sucks, but the patio was great in the recently-awesome weather.  The service was great... the waiter knew the menu inside and out, had great recommendations, and was the guy who remembers your order without a pad and somehow doesn't screw it up.Sangria-DeliciousMojitos-SameSeviche (spelled that way) -DittoGambas y Pollo-See AbovePumpkin Soup (seasonal)-Best I've HadThe bad - I think they are pretty over-priced for Cuban food.  Don't get me wrong, the food is great, but I don't think Cuban food should fall in the $20/plate range.  You need a key to get into the restrooms, which makes it feel kind of like a gas station.  You also get a feel that most male customers just go behind the dumpsters, not that I did that...  This place would have been an easy 5-stars except for one thing, that totally blew the experience.  The waiter automatically added a 20% tip to the bill, on top of tax.  Ordinarily he would have earned it.  But when questioned, he said they always do that on large parties.  We were a party of 5.  He was extremely arrogant about it, saying nobody's ever questioned it.  Totally ruined the whole evening.  And of course, there was no mention of an auto-tip on the menu, go figure.  I could understand if there were 10 of us, you get it.Overall, I would be excited to go back again.  It's a great place to go if you are craving some pretty good authentic food in the valley that isn't Mexican.  Grab a $28 pitcher of sangria and/or a few mojitos, splurge on some appetizers, and go for just about anything on the menu.  Nobody in our group left disappointed, with the food at least.
4	Their Mojitos give you awesome dreams.  I'm not kidding.  Last night, after a couple (literally, I only had two, this isn't code for I got wasted... although it usually is), I dreamt that I was in some sort of vampire army where all the guys where hot and shirtless.  Let's just say it was a good dream.  I can't guarantee you too will find yourselves in the rippling biceps of the undead if you drink their Mojitos, but it's worth a shot.Aside from the pleasant side effects experienced later, Havana Cafe is a must try.  If not just for the fact that it's charming.  I'm not a Mojito connoisseur, so my opinion means nothing.  I will say, the second one was a bit too sour for my taste.  I need to go back and try the food to really make a judgment call, but the service was great and the one appetizer I tried was pretty tasty.  I'd probably go for the bean dip and banana chips next time, though.
4	We loved the live music and outdoor patio. Food was great. Very authentic.
4	Awesome food and great service. I love to try different cuisines and this place has encouraged me to try more cuban food. We had the cuban sampler and the pollo ajjillo. The sampler was awesome. I would give 3 stars for the other dish. You must try the flavored sodas. They are really nice and so different from what sodas we generally drink. For the dessert we tried the flan which wad heavenly.
2	First time trying Cuban food, so that was fun to try something new.  Other than that, there was nothing to really rave about.  The wait staff did not seem thrilled to be there, people had little kids acting up in the tiny restaurant and the tables are on top of each other, so cell phone conversations took away from the experience too.  Not sure I would go again, but glad we finally gave it a try.
2	This Havana Cafe location fell very short of our expectations.  We were greeted and shown to a table surrounded by plastic patio chairs.  Looking around, we noticed this was part of the restaurant's decor, which seemed odd considering the price of the dishes averaged $20/plate.  We were offered a $3 mojito drink special, which was fair but poorly muddled.  For entrees we selected the Bistecs Cubanos, which was bland, and the Salmon con Salsa Papaya, which was admittedly good.  Though one dish was OK, we left the restaurant wondering what all of the hype was about.  We will not be returning to the Havana Cafe given the poor value of the meal and the less-than-notable ambiance.
4	One word to describe this place? Cute. Another? Tasty.The BFF and I visited Havana Cafe for the first time and hopefully not the last. We went for lunch on a Saturday so it wasn't very busy. The place is pretty small (and cute!) but there are many tables inside and out. They had festive Cuban music playing which added to the atmosphere.Since neither of us know much about Cuban food we decided to go with the tapas sampler. Perfect for two people, it was loaded with 6 of their tapas. I'll murder the names, but there were plantains, chorizo, a tamale, black bean fritters, cod fritters and one other meat item I can't remember the name of. We also got a side of Sun Chips (sweet potato fries) and a half pitcher of red sangria because that's how we ladies roll for Saturday lunch.Everything in the sampler was delicious. My favorites were the plantains, the black bean fritters and the tamale but I really did like it all. The sweet potato fries were good but I've had better. That's the only thing I probably wouldn't order again. Nothing in the sampler was spicy so it's a good option for just about anyone, except vegetarians.The sangria was good, more wine tasting than some sangrias. i'd like to try the white sangria next time.The service was great. Everyone was friendly and they didn't try to speed us along or anything as we took our time chatting and munching.They have a pretty extensive menu so I'm looking forward to going back and trying a few more things next time.
3	I had waited for awhile to try this place, as it's buried in a small little shopping center and couldn't find anyone who wanted to enjoy Cuban food. I first had Cuban food at an awesome little restaurant in DC and it was amazing. This, however, was not that place. The summary? I enjoyed it - it was okay, but will not be going back, especially for the bill I paid. The atmosphere is pretty cute, it's in a little house-like restaurant in a small shopping center tucked away on Camelback. But it's pretty quiet inside, so I'm not sure I would really like that for a date. Also, the bathroom is outside, which is a little strange. I had a glass of Malbec that wasn't all that great, but I'm willing to forgive wine. The other two had cocktails which they really enjoyed - so I think I just ordered poorly.Then we ordered 5 appetizers and two entrees to split between three people as we wanted to try all that we could. We had the plantains (they were good, but not the best I've had), then plantain chips with bean dip which was amazing! That was the best part of the meal. We ordered three more appetizers that I didn't really eat, so I can't judge them. I ordered the chicken with the mango sauce that came with beans and rice. For the price of the meal I was very underwhelmed. It was a really sizeable piece of chicken, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce and the beans and rice were just so-so. The service though was awesome though. The waiter was great and answered all of our questions and recommended great appetizers. 4 stars for the service for sure.Again, I don't think I would go back often, but I'm glad I at least tried it out. I'm also really happy that if I want legitimate Cuban food, I'm coming back here.
2	We have tried Havana Cafe several times as we love Cuban food (used to live in Miami). Tonight, once again we had just OK food and way over paid. My Daughter has to eat "gluten free" and we found out today they do NOT have a dedicated fryer.  At the table next to us the kids were eating chicken nuggets.  My Celiac peers please double check before eating here.The Masas de Puerco was dry and I ended up with the burned part of the beans from the bottom of the pan.  The food is barely average and super expensive.  We had 2 appetizers and 2 main dishes for four of us (2 kids) with one soda and it was over $60.  Kids dishes are $9.95.
4	Never been to a place like this before, but I am a fan of Cuban food now!  I had the paradise pork (see pictures) It was a little sweeter than I had expected, but really good.  Beans and rice were spicy, but really tasty.  I also highly recommend the fried bananas!!  I could eat a whole plate of those things ... my only suggestion would be to put chocolate sauce all over them hahaha!!!  Can't wait to go back and try more.  The service was really good and friendly.   A must try if you are in the area.
4	Craving authentic Cuban cuisine? Well I was, and with one trip to Havana Cafe I satistied my craving. With a small and basic interior, it is far from a glamourized restaurant. However, what Havana Cafe lacks in apperance it makes up for in substance. Quality of the food, authenticity of the dishes and excellent customer service are the factors that really make this place stand out for me. Everything I tasted was extremely rich and packed with flavor. I ordered the ceviche, and it was AWESOME. It left an essence of piquant limes, ripe tomatoes and crisp bell peppers lingering on my tongue. I also thoroughly enjoyed their fried plantain chips with black bean dip (you've got to try it!!!!) This place serves the real Cuban deal.The food here isn't cheap, so plan on spending a good chunk of change on your meal. Also, I'm hoping that I just visited on an off night because the mojito I ordered tasted more like a margarita as it lacked that refreshingly crisp mojito taste. It was disappointing but I'm determined to come back here and give them another chance. That way, I'll have an excuse to check out their mojito specials on Mondays!Our server was awesome and highly attentive. The fact that they have live music is also pretty cool. Overall, this place has a lot of authentic character and that's why I'm a fan. I enjoy unique dining experiences, and Havana Cafe definitely fits that bill. So, if your looking for something different, check this place out! Your taste buds will thank you.
5	Fantastic food, nice and simple style place, i loved it, will be back many times.Best food i have had. soooo good.
5	I miss this place every day.Used to live right behind it, and took it for granted.  Simple and the yummiest.Their Berenjena con Garbonzo is one of the most magical things I have ever put in my mouth.Black bean fritters, ham croquettes-- everything is good.OH!  Their cocktails!!
4	Back for our annual Havana Cafe fix. Our entrees and deserts were excellent as usual. I had the brisket (Ropa Vieja, with moros and maduros fritos) followed by the Pudin de Pan con Chocolate, while my girlfriend had the Gambas y Pollo (jumbo shrimp and boneless breast of chicken in a lobster broth) and the Arroz con Leche (rice pudding laced with anise). Special kudos for the brisket, which was the best I've ever had.My mojito was good but not great (as it always has been before), and they've definitely reduced the size. However, the only significant disappointment was the Pastelitos de Carne appetizer -- the pastry was nice and flaky, but it was burned slightly on the bottom, while also being somewhat cold in the middle. We'll get something else next time. Still, that's a minor blemish on an otherwise wonderful meal.
3	Havana Cafe caters for Passover and provides the greatest Kosher for Passover food I've ever had.  Now that I've outed myself as a Jew, let me just say that Kosher for Passover is one step above regular Kosher rules requiring no bread products, which usually means that the food is even blander than usual.  This may not seem possible after you've had a Kosher meal, but it turns out that the food tends to get even blander the more ingredients that are not allowed.  Somehow Havana is able to overcome the bland requirement to create the best kosher for Passover food I've ever had.  The brisket is good for several meals, and the dish with the eggplant and matzah is amazingly good even though there is no meat and it is not better than the brisket.  Besides, it's nice to have some more leftovers after I am done eating the leftover brisket.But. . . how come the food at the restaurant isn't as good?  That just seems to be one of the mysteries of life that I have been unable to fathom after five visits.  The Kosher for Passover food is actually much better than anything I have ever ordered at the restaurant.  My wife really likes the place even though the location near us closed, so I'll continue to contemplate this mystery and look forward to Passover and leftovers.
3	I love cuban food! Arroz con Pollo is one of my favorite dishes and honestly Havana Cafe did not disappoint! The dish was delectable! HOwever... I hate, hate, hate when I get an amazing meal but it is ruined by yucky uncrusty cheap bread... So although I loved the food, Havana please PLEASE get some tasty crusty bread!
3	I'm very sad to write this update, but feel obligated to do so. My friend and I called Havana at 8:30pm on a Thursday night (5/12) to find out what time they close. We were 5 minutes away. The woman who answered said they normally close at 9pm but since they didn't have any customers for the past hour, they were closing in 10 minutes. In my opinion, this is unacceptable. We love Havana's food, but feel the service has been hit or miss for years. It was the food that kept us coming back. Now, I'm not sure we will be going back anytime soon.
4	I really enjoy this place...i love cuban food...my favorite is fried plantains and the black beans and rice...yum yum...i am obssessed with their mojitos...it is a little pricey but good food is worth it...it is different...the restaurant is very small and quaint...the staff is so sweet and nice and give great suggestions...
2	I have never written a review, but the food at Havana Cafe was so underwhelming (and not in the least bit good) that I feel compelled to share. I ordered the Pollo Ajillo which, in reality, was a pile of salt with a side of chicken and rice. I opted for Arroz con Gandules instead of white rice as it has been years since I have had this tasty Puerto Rican side. The whole thing was almost inedible... I came home and actually brushed my teeth immediately, it was so bad!  My husband had the Pollo Cubano, which was equally underwhelming and nothing that we could not make at home ourselves.  The restaurant gets an extra star for the wonderful Cafe Cubano and the extremely attentive wait staff .  I had high hopes for this place but the next time I have a craving for Cuban food, I will be heading to Sabor Cubano.
5	This place was great!!! Went there last night and had a great experience. We showed up at 9pm and there was plenty of seating inside and outside on the adorable patio with lights strung up and music playing. Our server was fantastic, and he recommended the black bean fritter appetizer which was to DIE for. I would go back again just for those, with the avocado dip, they were amazing. We also had the gazpacho soup, which was good, nothing amazing but there's not a whole lot you can do with gazpacho. Also had a chicken entree that had fried plantains and beans and rice that was quite good but too big to finish. Great wine and Brazilian beer too. All in all, a great experience and we will definitely come back soon!
2	Let me start by saying that I absolutely LOVED the food.  My dinner was spot on.So why the 2 stars?Quite frankly, it was way over priced.  And I'm not talking about a few dollars too expensive.  For an average dinner, you'll be spending $25 to $30.  And while the food is tasty, the ambiance does not come close to warranting $30 per plate.
2	I lived in Miami for many years, so I can say this was mediocre Cuban food with some authority. Not bad, but for what you got, the price was outrageous. For that kind of money, you could do some real fine dining.
3	Would be a solid 4 stars, except the menu seems to be overpriced across the board. Met a friend here for a late dinner on a Friday night, the small restaurant (and patio) were about half full. We sat outside. Atmosphere is about what you'd expect from an old strip mall type cafe along Camelback. Nicely set back from the road, though. Service was very friendly and helpful, offering suggestions to the overwhelmingly large menu. In order to fit the budget, we both went with the special of 3 courses for $19.99. My gazpacho was incredibly tasty & fresh, very delicious. Friend had black bean fritters, which were described as "very beany", and good. Main course was chicken with sweet onions, rice & beans for me (can't remember the exact name) and the pulled pork, rice & beans for my friend. Both entrees hit the spot. Dessert choice was chocolate bread pudding, nice, warm and creamy. Yum. With two beers and a glass of chardonnay, the total bill was around $65. Not bad, but considering it was the least expensive option on the menu, the presentation, atmosphere and quality wouldn't be enough for me to spend $25-$30 per entree as most were listed. Not quite worth it. I'd go back, maybe for lunch or for tapas, just to try some of the other dishes.
2	I really wanted to like this place. Due to poor service and overpriced entrees, they only get 2 stars. We ordered the black bean fritters with avocado dip, the pulled pork, the Cuban style steak and flan for dessert. It was just "ok." The food alone was at least 3 stars; however, in my opinion the price was too expensive for the quality of their food. If I'm going to pay $30 for my meal, I want to at least sit on a non-patio plastic chair. On to the service . . . the whole time, we wished we had the other waiter. He seemed happy to work there and was so informative to his customers. Our server was more concerned about pushing us to order more food that she decided to slack on her waitressing abilities (i.e. refilling water). She would say subtle things to make us feel like we were not ordering enough, such as "that's it! just one dessert?," "any other appetizer?," "are you sure you don't want a sangria?" These weren't said with a smile either. She was worried about her tip amount, and she should be after how she treated us. Needless to say, I would have given them 1 star but the food made up for it. I think I'll try some place else for my Cuban fix.
2	I want to like it more, I really do.
4	Every time I come here I always tell myself NEXT TIME I'm only ordering black bean soup, tapas, and the guava pasteles! Then the selective amnesia sets in... Enter Groupon. So last weekend I couldn't pass up the Havana Cafe Groupon - Groupons always make me feel just a little bit better about dining out on overpriced Cuban, or any overpriced food/service in general. The one I purchased was for something called "completas" - complete family meals to-go for 4, normally priced at $39.95 but going for $20 through Groupon. When I was a kid I lived next door to this Cuban family in LA and I fondly remembered the tower of styrofoam containers filled with black beans, pollo con arroz, plantains, and bread that often accompanied the Sera family when they paid us visits. I was excited so I gave it a shot. At $20, what could it hurt?The lady on the phone was very nice. She took the order, asked if I'd like to upgrade the col salad (like a citrus slaw) to a mista salad (mixed greens) for $2.50 more. I declined. I went with the paradise pulled pork with moros and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert. It was ready in 15 minutes. I went to pay and there was some confusion about the value of the Groupon but it was honored in full and I was charged about $3.77 for the tax. I got home only to find that the Cuban bread had been left out. Major bummer! As for the meal - the portions were probably enough to fill 2 adults, assuming they ate every last bite, but the moros, pork, and plantains were all sensational! The col salad I could probably have done without but the chocolate bread pudding was just AH-MAHZING! All in all I'd probably skip the completas next time, unless I had the Groupon again, but I'd definitely come back for black bean soup, tapas, and dessert!
2	I was so looking forward to making this a restaurant that I could frequent often since I am a huge fan of Latin food. I invited my grandparents to meet me here for dinner back in March 2011. The inside of the restaurant is inviting until you realize that your chairs are those that you see at Lowe's for a backyard pool party....plastic? Come on for the prices they are asking averaging $20-35 a plate. Why plastic chairs? We started off with 4 mojitos and some appetizers. Platanos-fried plantains with garlic sauce. They were okay but found them to be more on the chewy side than crispy. We all had Ropa Vieja with potatoes and rice. I was disappointed in my main entree as it was overpriced for the quality of food that I was served. My grandparents seemed to enjoy their dishes but also were so engaged in making the evening special since it was the night before my grandmother's birthday. My bf was not impressed with his entree either. This is not real Cuban food and I can tell you this because I have a close friend who is Cuban that has cooked for me. get your passport and travel to Cuba through Canada and go have yourself some REAL Cuban cuisine not this crap that they "call" Cuban food. It is overpriced for all that you get. it got two stars because the service was attentive and staff was friendly plus the 3 mojitos I drank were the best out of everything there!
3	We usually go to the one on Bell Rd in N. Scottsdale but were in the area so tried this second location. I again had the Berenjena con Garbanzo, and it was again just as lovely. If your a fan of eggplant you've got to try it!I usually order it with peas instead of rice and so expected it, but they didn't have peas so instead had the black beans on the side. It was different from how I am used to eating it but it was still very good! The black beans are good. It was the first time I had them so the unexpected change was good. They also didn't have the usual asparagus so brought me a little salad of cabbage and some sort of vinaigrette? It was delicious and somewhat like coleslaw but also completely unique.  Again a nice switch up from the norm. I agree with most of the other views that the price is a little high for the type of food, but having had my experience with Cuban food in Miami on many trips I can say its decent. So is worth it every now and again. Our service at this location was also great. Very attentive and lots of check in's to see how we were.I actually think the plastic chairs lend to the " feel" of the place. If you have ever spent time in Little Havana or off the beaten path away from South Beach, or Lincoln Rd in Miami, you know what I mean. But I think it supposed make you feel as if your "patio" dining, in the tropics even inside here in AZ.
2	I have to say, I was very disappointed with my dining experience at Havana Cafe last night... the place smelled wonderful upon walking in and everything tasted okay (though not as fresh as I would have expected for the price), but I was thrown off-guard by the plastic chairs and frozen fishstick-resembling appetizers!The sangria is delectable and, in the moment, I enjoyed the ceviche. However, the tapas sampler was incredibly disappointing... I've traveled throughout the Latin Caribbean and this food did not meet my expectations. Most importantly, though, I awoke in the middle of the night to horrible cramping, chills, and diarrhea that kept me up for hours. I have strong reason to believe this was food poisoning from the restaurant (given I didn't eat anything else last night) and I have every intention of pursuing a full refund.
3	Groupon deals are not meant for all places. Some should avoid it like the plague, and that list includes Havana Cafe. The three stars are for the food; everything else needs to be overhauled. The restaurant is really tiny, and filled with plastic chairs to capacity, which affects mobility somewhat. With the Groupon deal, this problem was compounded, because by 6.30, it was already filled up. Like many reviewers have mentioned, it wouldn't hurt the waiters to smile and do some chitchat. The day we went, there were just two people rushing around taking orders and serving food, and another who was ushering in guests, handling the phone, and printing out the receipts. He had so much to do, that he was (not unexpectedly) making errors...as he did with our bill.We ordered the tapas platter, which came with deliciously warm Cuban bread, and served to whet our appetites. I got the Chicharrones de Pollo, which was fried pieces of chicken dipped in spicy batter, served with a side of beans and rice and plantains. It was nice, but too dry for my taste and I wish they had been more generous with the beans.K got the Boliche Mechado, which is roast beef stuffed with chorizo and cooked in red wine, served with a side of rice and beans. Very tasty!The flan that we ordered for dessert more than made up for the sour service. It was made to perfection, and wasn't too sweet. Though the food was good, I found it overpriced, and certainly the charm you would expect from a neighborhood hangout like the Havana Cafe was totally missing. Also, I don't know if this happens there often, but the day we went, the electricity went out thrice, for about 5 mins each time, and we were left eating in semi-darkness! Strange!
2	The world's slowest service - do not go here if you are in a hurry. The food was a miss for me but I don't blame the restaurant - I had the Pollo Cubano and the flavor was really bright - not really my thing but maybe I just don't like Cuban flavors. I did enjoy the rice and beans on the side. The server was courteous but so sloooooooow - I don't see a reason to go back.
5	We came for lunch. My husband had the lunch special of the jerk chicken with rice beans and a citrus slaw. It was very tasty. I had the Ropa Vieja with plantains and black beans and rice. IT was absolutely delicious. The waitress was very friendly and very attentive. Our ice teas were never less than half full and she made a point to check in frequently. We had a Groupon and everything went smoothly. We will definitely be back.
5	Me gusta comida de cubano!I came here with a friend, and we used a Groupon.  I have heard a lot of great things from coworkers and friends about this small little place in Arcadia Phoenix area.  I have driven by it several times, and it was finally time to get a feel of Cuba.The waiter gave us a very homey and family type feeling with the passion he showed by explaining the menu.  I ordered the Pollo Cubano, which has grilled chicken with savory sweet onions on top and a side of black beans and rice.  The onions gave a dynamic sweetness and yumminess that I can't explain with words.  My friend ordered dried plantains.  The first order had black beans inside, and the other was almost like a sweet plantain banana dessert.  We enjoyed the food family style with some beer.I will definitely have to make a return trip to Havana Cafe!
4	Pros:  The food is really delicious.  I had their Ropa Vieja and DH had their Chicken Cubano.  Both dishes were terrific.  The black beans alone are worth the trip.Cons: the ambiance.  The exterior is inviting with the Spanish styled roof, but there is a funky aroma when you enter.  Seems to need deep cleaning in the carpet, bathroom, or maybe a fresh coat of paint.  I agree with others who complain about paying $20 + for an entree and sitting on plastic chairs.  Place is dying for some help in the interior.I probably wouldn't take a date here.
3	My husband and I had a Groupon or we likely wouldn't have tried this restaurant. I've driven past it for years and always wanted to eat there, but it's ridiculously overpriced. Even with the Groupon ($25) our bill was an additional $70!My husband had the Emparedado Cubano, which is a Cuban sandwich which was $16 and was quite tasty, although he picked off the pickles. I just thought it tasted like a pickly ham sandwich. I had the Gallina Frita, which was excellent, but a huge amount of food for one person. The shredded chicken was succulent and rich, with caramelized onions and other flavors and the side dishes were good but not extraordinary. At least I had leftovers for lunch the next day.My husband really enjoyed his two mojitos and he's quite picky about his mojito quality. My caipirinha was just okay, as it was overly limey. We had the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer and they were excellent. The waiter took a very long time to greet us after we were seated and he continued to be absent for very long intervals, although he was very nice and helpful in helping me pick out a main dish to order. Overall, our meal including appetizer and dessert took slightly more than 2 hours, although the restaurant was not at all busy (when we got there, there were maybe 3 other tables seated).I agree with others that think the decor is pretty sad. The plastic chairs seem out of place in a restaurant that asks you to pay upwards of $16 per entree.Probably won't ever go back, unless it's for happy hour, since this place is just so expensive, but the food was quite good.
3	Let me say this about Havana Cafe: the service was excellent. I have no complaints here. Staff was friendly and attentive.The entrees, however, was average and even sub-par for the price. For as much as it all cost, I expect my tongue to salivate for the next bite; mine didn't. It was merely alright. Desserts fared a little better: the coconut flan was to DIE!
4	Delicious food. Great service. Interior not the best but they could of made it better by having Cuban music on or something.
5	Great food.  Great service. Loved the mohitos...just like in Cuba.  And the Ropa Vieja is excellent.
4	My husband's favorite place in town and he took his friends and family there. Everyone loves the place. The waiter did the bill wrong first time when we were there. But the food is good.
4	In spite of being on the corner of 44th and Camelback it does a good job of insulating you from the traffic and taking you some place else, in this case our dear Communist neighbors to the South.  I like the sampler because it allows you to enjoy the finest island interpretations of pork, beef, and chicken.  Also, no meal is complete without going bananas for the ....well, tostones.You gotta hand it to those Castro brothers.  They forcefully preside over a country that has a pretty great national cuisine.  Viva La Revolucion!
2	I was hoping for so much more.  Kind of a cute looking restaurant.  Outside patio is quaint and fine.  We had the tostones which weren't as crispy as i like them and the sauce that accompanies the tostones wasn't that great.  They were already all out of the arroz con pollo by 6:30 p.m. (what?!) so I had another chicken dish.  Husband had the pulled pork.  We were not wowed by either dish.  Wasn't horrible but nothing to come back for.The worst part was how all over the place the wait-staff was.  One person was like the hostess but was coming to our table throughout the night.  Another dude came and took our food order but was so creepy that i nearly lost my appetite.  Yet another person delivered our meals but again returned to the table at some point to clear a dish and then another person cleared other dishes.  We waited forever for our check, forever to pay, etc.  And although it sounds like a lot of people were coming to our table, few people actually visited us after our food arrived to see how everything was.  My husband was SO annoyed.  Definitely not a great place and not worth its money.  it's a shame because if the owners knew how badly run it was, they'd change it--very much out of a kitchen nightmares episode.
5	Another awesome dinner at Havana Cafe! The service was a slow because they were short a waiter, but everything else was just about perfect. We split the onion/almond soup, which was unbelievably delicious, and my mojito was back to its usual perfection. Both the Masas de Puerco Fritas (crisp pork morsels with mojo-garlic lime sauce, rice and beans) and the seafood special were outstanding. Cheesecake with chocolate rum fudge sauce closed out the evening, and we both agreed it was among the best cheesecakes we've ever had (and the slice was HUGE).What are you waiting for? Go now!
5	The distinguished puertorican writer and  political advocate Lola Rodriguez de Tio in her 1893 publication of the poem: "A Cuba" said: "Cuba y Puerto Rico son de un pajaro las dos alas". (Cuba and Puerto Rico are the two wings of a bird). And for those of us living far away from our beloved Islands, The Havana Cafe offers the perfect mixture of culture, food, flavors, music and atmosphere.  Especially when one doesn't feel like getting in the kitchen or catching the next flight to San Juan.  Pricey?  Yes, like any other premium service of its kind.  Delicious and as authentic as one can find 2000 miles away from home.  Don't forget to try the "Arroz con Gandules"; it is phenomenal! Sorry mom!
5	I had a Groupon and went for dinner with my boyfriend last night.  This place is amazing!  We started off with the tapas sampler, and everything on it was great.  We also ordered bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo, which just melted in my mouth.  For our entree, we shared a fried chicken dish--very good and actually not too heavy.  And if course, since it's a Cuban restaurant, I had mojitos.  They were delicious, and very authentic--no Bacardi!  In addition to the great food, the service was fast and friendly.  We will definitely be going back soon!
4	We were driving down from California (on the I-10) so this place was a bit out of the way. It was worth it!! The food is superb, adequate portions, and reasonable prices. The wait staff was cheerful and the recorded Cuban music made me want to get up and dance.One tip: It seems that Cubans love things deep fried. Make sure to ask if the dish you are ordering is fried. We got one sampler dish that was all deep fried. The oil was fresh tasting and not overdone, but I prefer non-fried.....I should have asked.Otherwise, go there and enjoy a really good meal in a good atmosphere.
1	Yelp alerted me that I have a review to complete, from nearly 2 years ago. I remember how I felt about this place back then, and still feel strongly about this place now. Recollections of how much I would not like to return to this place again. Find a place that serves Cuban-inspired food, or if there is a frozen aisle that does, heat it up in a microwave, transfer it onto a plate, and voila! Of course you'll remember to remove that non-microwaveable plastic film that Havana overlooked.
5	Excellent!  Very good food and service. Loved the dark rum mojito.
3	Not the best food I've had, but certainly the best service and servers around!! Very happy atmosphere! Great place for date night but only for the environment. Still looking for awesome flavorful Cuban food. But yes great little restaurant!
5	Can't believe this place isn't better-reviewed. Have probably been here a dozen times and never had an item I didn't like. Starters are always fab -- wonderful black bean and chicken soups, kids love the plantain chips and black bean dipping sauce. I would go here just for the bacon-wrapped chorizo-stuffed dates. Meaty, salty, sweet luscious goodness? Yes, please. They do a wonderful (and HUGE) arroz con pollo, and their caribbean chicken with black beans and rice is also to die for.  Friendly service, nice location, Havana Cafe is always a winner.
3	This place is small but had very clean shiny silverware and plates and I was impressed with that.I decided to try an entree salad and picked the one that was suppose to be mango glazed chicken. It soon came out and the first thing I noticed was the greens were all WILTED and dry and warm. The greens were topped with a small (maybe two oz.) plain (not mango glazed) grilled chicken breast that was sliced and very dry. The plate was garnished with two sliced grape tomatoes and two half sliced orange sliced. The dressing was suppose to be citrus vinaigrette but it was thick and might have been the mango glaze that should have been on the chicken and certainly didn't  seem like any kind of vinaigrette. ( almost 2 stars) My husband had the shredded beef brisket. I tasted the brisket and it was lean for brisket but pretty much unseasoned. I didn't try the rice and beans but my husband said they were very good and well seasoned and he mixed the brisket mixture with the rice and beans and said all together that way they were good. (3 stars)The restrooms are outside I don't know if they are air-conditioned.2.5 stars
2	I came to the Phoenix location for lunch through Groupon.  I ordered the beef brisket called Ropa Vieja, which was very tough and like eating strands of rope.  I could see where it got it's name "ropa", because it is like cooked strands of rope. There was plenty of meat, but the flavor was all boiled and leached out of the meat.  It was served to me like a stew , but the beans and rice side and the ropa was swimming in a plateful of water almost to the edge of the plate.  The ropa stew had no flavor, like it was boiled in a big potful of plain water that kept getting changed.  I had to add a lot of salt., shake more and more and more salt on it.   It was very ICK to me.   I wish I ordered the cerviche instead.  I didn't think the ropa was worth it even with the Groupon discount, I would not want that dish even if it were free, unless I was starving.  I told the waitress it was very bland and asked her if it was normal to have all that water in the plate.   She said it was "juicey", but to me, juice implies flavor, but I guess "juice" for water is a waitress being positive and politically correct on her job.   My jaws were tired trying to chew the strands of "rope".  She did not offer to bring me something else.  She said that was the way it was.For dessert, I ordered the coconut mini flan with mango sauce, and that was really good!   I'd give it an A and the size was larger than the word mini implies.  Sorry for such  negative review about the ropa, but I tell it like it is, and if I thought it was terrific, I'd surely say so.Maybe you will find something else on the menu to your liking, or maybe you are less discriminating than I am about tough and flavorless Ropa meat swimming in a plateful of water  (Yes, I know the difference between juice, sauce, soup, and water.).   I consider myself a great cook and I eat out a lot.  I only tried this Ropa, and it is not good enough to make me wanna give this restaurant another change at my own cost.   The waitress was very nice and attentive though, I have no complaints about her service, but she did not offer me a substitute.  I would have given it a one star, but she was a friendly and attentive waitress.
1	I love cuban food!  And so I take every chance to eat it, so when I saw a cuban very close to our hotel in Scottsdale, I was there!  Unfortunately, the minute I walked in, I should have turned around and walked right back out again.  There was a distinct smell that wasn't clean and wasn't pleasant.  But my interest in  a good cuban meal got the better of me.  Big mistake.The food was definitely sub-par.  I had the sampler, which included pollo cubano, ropa vieja, and masas de puerco.  Unfortunately, none of the dishes was particularly flavorful, and none were good renditions of the dish.  The pollo was bland other than an overly acidic sauce, the ropa vieja was just lacking in flavor and the vegetables and broth hadn't been blended together, and the masas weren't crispy in the least.  The whole meal was a huge let down.
5	Some of the best Cuban food I've had and very reasonably priced as well! I can never decide between the bistecs cubano or the bacaloa (salt cod)!
3	I love Cuban restaurants. I guess I have to face it. The staff here is extremely nice. We came in for lunch, and were early so it was not crowded.  The black bean soup was perfect. The rice was excellent. I would have like a bit more pork shoulder on my cuban sandwich. It was toasted just right with the cheese gooey.  The fried bananas were just right. The Cuban tamale was as good as always.  i could not figure ot how a Cuban Restaurant would not have any Cuban Coffee on the day we were there?? Oh well you can't hit it perfect every day.
3	I was somewhat disappointed in this restaurant. I went here today for lunch after going to the other location about 7 years ago and really enjoying it. I had a Groupon that was about to expire, so the BF and I went there for lunch. The place was fairly empty, only two other tables were full at about 12:30. I ordered the paradise pork (I think?) and he had the fried pork. Our server was very nice and spoke highly of my dish. The dish was supposed to have bell peppers and habanero peppers in it, but it was not spicy. The pork had a weird flavor to it....kind of like it was a bit old or possibly frozen, but I don't know if that is for sure the case. The bf's pork was kind of dry and didn't have a ton of flavor. When you ate the meat with the rice and beans it was alright because the rice and beans were actually pretty good. We also got the maduras which were good, a little mushier than I've had elsewhere, but good flavor. The real problem with this place is their prices. Without the groupon our lunch would have cost around 30$. That is a bit ridiculous, in my opinion. I don't think I would go here if I had to pay full price, but I might try it again if I had a discount. Overall: Don't run here, but don't run away from here.
5	If you're looking for a delicious Phoenix feast, head to one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley, Havana Cafe.I always try a little bit of everything when I'm at the Cuban restaurant, and when my pal and I went this week, our meal was no exception. We had more than 10 different menu items peppering our table, and we both left stuffed and happy. Like it is for me, Havana Cafe instantly became one of his favorite restaurants after one meal there.One of the coolest things about Havana Cafe is that there are mojito making classes offered there periodically. I've attended one and loved it, and the mojitos at Havana Cafe are amazing. When we went to dinner this week, we got a pitcher of sangria instead of mojitos, because sangria is another one of my favorite drinks. The sangria at Havana Cafe is packed full of fruit flavor, and it's a really refreshing drink that goes well with the heat of the Cuban dishes.Let's start first with my favorite dish at Havana Cafe, the Frituras de Frijoles Negros ($5.25). They're bite-sized black bean fritters served with a cool and creamy avocado dip that is to-die-for. I love, love, love this dish and could eat it all the time.The Maduros Fritos ($5.95) are just as amazing. They're sweet chunks of bananas that make a perfect dessert or sweet appetizer accompaniment. If you don't like eating raw bananas, you'll probably still love these.We also had vegetable empanaditas ($6.95), mini-pies chock full of veggies. For being such little appetizer treats, they're really filling and could make a great main course for vegetarians.I also had the Potage de Frijoles Negros ($4.95 for a bowl), which is a vegetarian black bean soup that is also very hearty. It's so tasty!My companion got the San Juan Combination ($16.95), a massive sampler plate that lets you taste seven different dishes-a Puerto Rican tamale, plantains and pork, a vegetable croquette, twice-fried plantains, peas cooked with rice and pork, fried pork and beans and rice. The dish could probably give you 2 days' worth of leftovers-and they're not gross leftovers, they're almost as good as if they'd just been served to you.Besides the phenomenal food, I love Phoenix's Havana Cafe for its intimate setting. The restaurant is comprised of a little dining room with mirrored walls, and there's also a patio. It's not quite Cuba, but the aromas and warm, welcoming atmosphere are enough to make you feel as relaxed as you would on vacation.
2	I had not been to this resturant in some time, now I remember why I have not been back.  The food is ok, however the atmopsphere is sub par for sure.  I had the cuban meatloaf, the meat and glazed yuca were dry, but eitable and fried bananas were obivously from a package.  The only thing great was the black beans.  For the prices of the food, you would think you would have more then a plastic chair to sit in.  One of the people helping to serve food, I think is one of the managers, actually needs a class on how to serve, sorry grasping my glass by the rim is not a proper way to serve a drink.  Also you need to wash your hands before serving food after counting money.  The cleaning bottle for the tables was on the same counter as the serving counter/mixing area for drinks.They really need a refresher course on food handling.  Possibily over due for a health inspection too.  I was very disappointed in my experienxe.
1	Havana Cafe refused my business today when I walked into their establishment wearing a trendy bluish, turquoise singlet. Apparently, this wannabe 4-star "cafe", that resides in a plaza for God's sakes has a clothing rule that says men have to wear sleeves, but women do not. I challenged, Keith, the waiter/proprietor, that my date was also wearing a similar sleeveless top and he proceeded to tell me that men are not allowed to wear sleeveless tops, and that if I were to eat there I would have to wear one of his awful red Hawaiian print polos with bamboo images on it that was two sizes too big! WTF?! So you'd rather offend me and require me to wear some crap Hawaiian shirt that I'm swimming in?! Mind you, it's 113 degrees out! In what world is this more "appropriate attire" than my tank and not outright sexual discrimination? For those of you who think this is a joke, it ACTUALLY HAPPENED!
5	Mmmm! Lunch for two here was great. We ordered several smaller plates and split it all. Every flavor was so unique. We devoured everything. The sun spots are tasty as well as the empanaditas and the tamale type thing wrapped in a banana leaf (I forgot the name). When we went, there was no one else there. Service was good. We ordered some desert also which was delicious. The decor isn't anything special, but it's not about that here- just the food!
4	My wife and I love ethnic foods, especially when the restaurants feel as different as the food. So tried Havana Cafe on a hunch and were very impressed with both. Felt like I was in a smaller, yet nice street-side cafe/resaurant in Latin America. Good start. First, we got the Repollo Relleno (pulled pork stuffed into 2 cabbage rolls, very lightly crusted on the outside and served with a light cream lime sauce and lemon slices. Light and savory.The Empaniditas de Longosta (Lobster Stuffed into tiangle-shaped crusts (similar to pot pie crust). It was on the lunch special and also delicious. This one a bit more filling yet equally as good.Also got the Seviche, which in our opinion was the best seviche we've ever had. Was a really delicious, yet light, served as a medley of seafood with avocado, citrus, white asparagus and lime sauce over greens.Definitely going back.
4	My sister and I came just because we read about this cafe having plantain chips, which we were craving. That being said, we can't speak for any other food, but these chips were so amazing, we had to get a second order. The black bean dip that came with it was especially tasty, and my sister, who doesn't like black beans at all, helped me eat it down to the bottom of the bowl.We were a little put off by the stale, quiet atmosphere and lack of music. We were two of four in the small dining area and felt uncomfortable having conversation when the others could hear every word. The only other thing that made our visit less than perfect was our waiter. He was really attentive to our needs (water, whether we needed anything else every once in a while, etc.), but standoffish/unfriendly for the most part.Bottom line, I will be back again with an emptier stomach so I can enjoy the crunchy plantain chips, and try other delicious looking dishes here.
2	This place is highly overpriced and over the top. The food was decent, yet indecently priced. If you are going to charge me $15+ for an entree, then don't seat me in a plastic chair that was procured no less than twenty years ago. Maybe it's part of the "charm," but I wasn't impressed, and I will not return unless the prices on the menu fall to fares that fit the flare. For the appetizer, I ordered the beef empanadas. Having traveled to Argentina, I know a good empanada. Havana's meat filled pasty left something to be desired - not enough spice and too greasy. For the entrees, I ordered the fried chicken and the paradise pulled pork. Both came with black beans and rice. The beans were good - blended with onions and cilantro. The rice was as plain as Jane. I found the chicken to be quite good. I liked the corn starch dusted coating and the overall flavor and moistness of the chicken. The paradise pulled pork was mediocre, at best. While the price was jacked to the max, the portion sure was not. I've had better tasting carnitas for half as much. I love when a restaurant leaves me excited to come back and try some more, and sadly Havana Cafe has not done that for me.
2	I had passed this place when traveling back and forth on Camelback for years, and finally a groupon brought me inside. Upon first entering the restaurant I was kind of surprised how small it was, which in my book is a good thing. The walls were filled with all things cuban. However all the tables had plastic chairs, you know the kind you find outside on a patio. Very uncomfortable and extremely tacky. The menu seemed pretty good, I had the Pollo Cubano. It was chicken with black beans and rice and a lime sauce. The sauce tasted great for the 1st few bites, but after that it was overwhelmingly citric, almost to the point where I couldn't eat it anymore.  Luckily my wife has ordered another chicken dish that was salty that I could swap with to break the taste up. If they dial back the amount of lime in the dish I think it could have been much better but I would not order again. My wife's dish was rather plain, just some chicken in sherry with rice, nothing memorable.A few other things, the table tops are made of glass with no tablecloth, so when you cut your food (with a butter knife mind you, since they had no other knives) your plate slides around. Then there is the cost. I normally don't mind paying 18-25 bucks for food, but not here. The food is way, way overpriced for what you get especially considered you are sitting in plastic lawn chairs. I think honestly the food should cost no more than $10 tops, until they upgrade the dining experience.
5	I had a really great experience at the Havana Cafe.. Everybody there was super nice and the service was great... I don't think our water glasses ever got to less than 1/2 full. The food was excellent. Price-wise it was a little more than we expected, but totally worth it. The sangria and drinks were kind of pricey, but ah well. Overall a very good experience- we will be back!
5	We've been here twice - once before Groupon hit and once with a Groupon. Both times the food was excellent-  we'd been to lunch. I am a sucker for their bean fritters and the lemony garlicky dip it comes with. Very good vegetarian entree - cho cho flavored with carribean curry. The husband devoured his tres leche and my flan. He seemed to enjoy his house sangria as well. Wish we lived closer - it's not an easy hike for some lazy people in chandler.
3	My boyfriend and I have been meaning to visit this place for a year now and finally made it over to Havana Cafe this week. The restaurant is small and quaint, nothing fancy but we enjoyed it. Since it was our first visit, we had a few questions on the menu, but our server wasn't really able to answer any of our questions. He did recommend the calypso chips and black bean dip, which we enjoyed. The Ropa Vieja that I ordered was good and the Paradise Pulled Pork that my boyfriend ordered was a little bland but also good. However, although we enjoyed it, I wouldn't really say these dishes are worth $15-$20 per plate, either in flavor or portion size. I wouldn't say we were disappointed in the visit, we did enjoy our food, but I'm giving it 3 starts for being average in flavor and overpriced (in our opinion.)
3	At the service person's strong recommendation, we ordered the most expensive dish on the menu, Paella de Havana and a combination of their popular tapas plate while we waited for the paella(45 minutes).  The tapas and the mojitos were delicious.  They really got my hope up for the highly recommended paella yet to come.  Boy, were we disappointed!!!! The paella had lobster, clam, mussel, chicken, shrimp, chorizo.  Sounds good?!  The rice was mushy and very salty, all of the seafood and chicken were OVER-cooked, the lobster was hallow and had very little meat.  Overall, it's not worth $68.  If my review were based on the paella, it'd have gotten only ONE star.  But I'm giving it  three stars because of its tapas and mojito.
1	"My wife and I ate there a few weeks back, I thought the atmosphere was quaint and inviting however after we were sat it took quite some time before our waiter came back to us for anything. I found him to be unwelcoming and inattentive the 2 Hispanic helpers were much more courteous and attentive. The food was Ok  it wasn't horrible but i would not write home about it. It was my fist time there and maybe it was an off night but i would be reluctant to recommend the place to a friend or return simply because the service was horrible. I do how however like ambiance.
5	If you are looking for the perfect spot for a first date, this is it!Quaint, romantic, and homey are a few words that come to mind.But the best part for me is; you can not have a bad meal here if you tried, that being said Pollo Cubano is my favorite dish!
4	Stopped by and I LOVED the plantains! OMG! I'm going to come here again and again when I'm in this area of town. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the table was wobbly, and the chairs are cheap
4	I enjoyed my meal here - definitely a place I'd come back to.I ordered the Pollo Cubano, which is citrus-marinated chicken with caramelized onions, with rice on the side. The chicken was juicy and tasty, and the rice was nice as well.Cheesecake for dessert. This was also very good - thick sweet crust and a delicious topping.
2	Any Latin restaurant that uses minute rice is horrible.  Havana Cafe is one of these places.  Overpriced, rice is awful, pasteles are dry,  The one good thing is the pork.  But it doesn't warrant my going back . . . EVER
3	Good food, great atmosphere and good service. The only really bad thing I can say, is that they are way over priced for what you get. Nice little spot to have a nice meal with your lady if you have some extra money to burn.
2	I just left the Havana Cafe and to say the least we were very disappointed. I have been to the Cafe months ago and enjoyed my meal immensely. I must say to be served the same 18.00 entree tonight half the size on a salad plate was a shock. On the appetizer side to be served four bacon wrapped dates served on a little plate witha dollie was a joke. It is a shame that a restaurant we visited and enjoyed just monthsago could change for the worse so quickly.
4	Black bean fritters rock and they have a couple good vegetarian options. They are always accommodating and make a good mojito. Oh and when they have the pumpkin bisque ... oh lord!
5	Perfect place for a special night out  with your favorite person. My BF and I had our first date here- it has a cozy, mom and pop shop type of feel and the service was great. The servers were helpful with their recommendations. We have been here several times and each time we order something different. So far my favorite thing on the menu is Ropa Vieja - juicy beef in a tomato based sauce. **Mouth watering**Any time I have visitors, I take them to this spot. If you like good Cuban food or want a pleasant and warm place for dinner and good conversation. This is it.. Happy Eating
1	I was raised in Miami with a Cuban mother so I think I have enough grounds to say that if you are looking for good Cuban food...this is not the place.  The food was tasteless, not authentic and way over priced. 3 croquetas (tiny ones and def not Cuabn) were $5.50  Dinner was $63 for my wife and I. we left hungry and dissapointed. :(
4	6 of us mostly had a very enjoyable meal (one had an overly breaded/deep fried fish which didn't sit well) in celebration of a recent holiday.  Smorgasbord of an appetizer is a great idea to maybe help you make up your mind as to what to get for dinner.  Special mojitos from the bar were very worthwhile.  Owners/staff are very attentive and always seem to remember our names.
3	Whoops...left this in drafts for almost 2 weeks.  Ok, so now it's been 2 weeks since my first meal at Havana Cafe.  Haven't had Cuban food since last Miami visit in '05.  The black bean fritters were delish!!!  I had the Ensalada Savilla...YUM.  I did steal some of my dad's beans and rice, which were good.  My daughter had tamales, which she loved, but they were chicken so I didn't try those.  My sangria was quite nice too.  Probably not my favorite restaurant, but it was a nice change of pace and tasty!
1	AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!food is awful, place smells.  Would not recommend this place at all.Food is made with this lime juice and all food is covered with onions, and the black beans and rice is GROSS.
5	Outstanding service!! This was our second visit and the people that work there truly take care of the customers.  The food is fantastic, I've tried something different on each occasion and both entrees were delicious!! Great atmosphere! Thanks
1	Ah, the dreaded worst-experience of my life, horrible service, overcharged BIRTHDAY meal...that ended up in moderate-severe food poisoning.I'm talking the kind of food poisoning where at one point I desecrated the restrooms of a lovely restaurant in downtown Phoenix and ended up laying face down on the sidewalk...to where a homeless man asked me if I was ok.Yeah.  It was that bad.  Food poisoning aside, it was STILL the worst meal of my life, and this WAS my favorite low-key restaurant in the valley.Apparently my birthday fell on the last day of a groupon or livingsocial redemption.  Unlucky us, we paid full price (more than actually...since we were charged for the wrong items they brought out and subsequently took back), and were treated worse somehow than the coupon folks -- because it was a set menu and so the kitchen didn't want to make things not on THAT menu -- despite our paying full freaking price.FACT: When one is celebrating their birthday, they want a cocktail.  I wanted a cocktail.  Actually, I wanted three.  I got my first cocktail after I'd been there nearly an hour (oh yeah, the "10 minute" wait I was told about was actually 40).  I didn't get a refill.  Or asked if I wanted a refill. Of that drink, or my water.  But I asked!  Oh, did I ask!   I drank my water and my dining companions.  And then eventually drank the melted ice from my un-refilled mojito. The 2 employees (great staffing job on a day you know will be busy with coupon redeemers!) were basically losing their minds, running around, and super stressed.  They had basically given up by the time we were eating. That is why I feel like the food poisoning occurred from something truly awful. Like employees deliberately fucking with my food horrible.I'm not sure what they normally do when people have their birthday at a restaurant, but we weren't offered dessert menus, let alone a comped dessert.  They knew it was my birthday.  They knew at the beginning we were paying the full price.  And still...worst.service.ever.***I actually filled out a comment card back in November listing my email address and phone number, where I specifically requested to be contacted (again, this was before the food poisoning).  This review was written right after the visit, and I sort of "sat" on it for literally over 6 months, in hopes someone would actually contact me.  I gave them the chance, I guess they really just don't give a shit.
4	Went here for a lunch with my husband the other day. I've never had Cuban food, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The food was good, but it wasn't as spicy as I was expecting. But that is probably just my misunderstanding of Cuban food! I had the sun spots for an app, and they were very good and hit the spot, but my fried chicken was not very exciting. I will probably come back to try something else. My husband loved his beef dish. Service was great and it was a nice little spot for a late lunch.
4	We have driven by this place before and always wanted to try it. When we saw it on Groupon, we decided, in spite of reviews, we would. GLAD WE DID...we really really liked it! The portions aren't huge, but we thought that it was plenty adequate. Some Americans think that if you don't get a HUGE plate of food, it's not worth it. Their food was delicious and enough for a decent meal...it was like going to someone's' house for dinner. LOVED the stuffed potato pancakes and stuffed dates. Polla Cubano was awesome, too.We were also VERY happy with the service, Unlike other reviews, we did not experience any problems. The waiter kept coming back to refill our waters after 2 sips! We actually had 2 waiters. Now, we were there on a Monday night, but we were quite happy.DEFINITELY WILL COME BACK. We're from Chicago, so we know good food. This was good food!!
1	I have eaten here many times, the menu has changed, food is OK.  $1.95 for sour cream, REALLY???  Enough said!  I will not be back.
2	i love the food here!very expensive,the service is very slow,only one food server,i really dont like to wait around for 40 minutes for food when i work all day without lunch plus i have to pay a food that expensive!not worth of my time,lots of restaurant out there folks who will care for good customer service!
2	Kid sized portions- left with a starving stomach and a lighter wallet.  My cup of coffee was not even 1/2 way full.  My food arrived on a doll size plate, only about 5 bitez. Ordered dessert and was quickly let down by that portion, too...shocker. I have seen children's meals with larger portions.  It would take double the amount of food to satisfy me.Too bad because if the portions were better I might have been able to appreciate the quality of the food.
1	This food was Horrible, very bland and dry I had the San Juan Combination. The Rice was dry no season or anthing. Puerto Rican Tamal was hard and dry it should have been moist and flavoral. Plantains was stiff as a rock and again no flavor. Mashed garlics plantains no flavor. My husband had Arroz con pollo the chicken was dry crispy and no flavor. Just save your money. This food had no Pizzazz or party in my mouth. The name sounds cool of the restaurant, but unfortunately so small and scrunched up. I would never recommend my friends or family at this place not even for appetizers and drinks.
1	We went with a group of friends, and were very disappointed, I have been there before and I strongly recommended place, however food was terrible and overprice, I don't what had happened, service was poor, waited long for waitress to take order, or even take the drinks order, when she finally took order for food it took more than one hour wait for food to come  one at a time, 20% was added to bill, and this was not OK specially after poor service. Anyway will definitely won't EVER go back....
5	Amazing happy hour deals.  Great food, don't let the appearance fool you.The ambiance of the place was sort of surprising, given the reputation and prices.  Plastic chairs?  Tiny, brightly lit dining room?  Kitschy "CUBA!!" pictures all over the place and a whole wall of mirrors?  It was a weird first impression.The happy hour specials were fantastic and worth going back for alone.  We had some sort of black bean balls (fried and a little spicy) the fried yucca roots and something else I can't remember.  All yummy. The wife and I both had the paella and it was also great.  A really good mojito, too.We shared the desert sampler and each had our favorites but agreed everything on the plate was delicious.
2	I really wanted to like this place, I really did. Unfortunately, our dinner just kept disappointing. Thank baby Jesus for Groupon, because if we had spent full price for our meals, I'd probably develop an eye twitch. I went with their $18 vegetarian dinner special (poblano stuffed peppers with white beans, covered in a creamy tarragon sauce) over rice. My boyfriend ordered the Gallina Frita (shredded fried chicken breast with onion and Moros- rice and black beans).The presentation of the food left something to be desired, but then again, so did the taste. We got pretty small plates (perhaps because I let it slip that we had a coupon?) The vegetarian poblano pepper entree ($18 mind you) had only one half of a stuffed pepper, over plain white rice, and was covered with a cheese sauce that was Velveeta-esque. There were no subtle nuances of flavors, just a bit of creamy slop with boiled tomato bits floating in the cheesy sea of regret. The corn bread that came with the meal was clearly microwaved and was 2"x 2"-- a sad display. The chicken entree was dry and almost tasteless, except for the overly salted moros. My boyfriend didn't even finish the chicken nor did he want my corn bread. This is a first on so many levels. This was Cuban cuisine?! Where's the seasoning? The spices? Where is the flavor?! We left the Havana cafe and bid adieu to the plastic chairs and the tasteless plates of microwaved sadness.
2	Growing up in Phoenix, I used to love Havana Cafe. I had birthday dinners here several times. This week, my Dad proposed that we revisit Havana Cafe to celebrate my Master's.When we arrived at 5:30 on a Tuesday, we were one of three tables in the restaurant. The server (there was only one) kept our waters refilled, but it took 25 minutes to have our orders taken. We ordered maduros and black bean fritters to start. The maduros were heavenly, but it is hard to go wrong with a fried plantain. The black bean fritters were... not what I remembered. It may have just been a bad batch, but ours were suspiciously liquid on the inside. For entree, I ordered Camarones Havana, my Dad had the Cuban sandwich, and my stepmom got a special: several pieces of pork with black beans and rice, yucca root, and more maduros. Dad loved the Cuban sandwich, stepmom seemed to enjoy the pork, but not much of the sides. We had to add a lot of salt to our food when it arrived, I don't think there was any added in the kitchen. I was disappointed with my ($22) Camarones Havana. I received no sides, and the plate was just bland. It became marginally better with salt, but still. Where's the flavor? I ended up eating black beans and rice off my parents' plates. By the time we left, the restaurant was mostly full inside, with a few people sitting outside. Because there was only one server, it took us another 20 minutes to get boxes and our check. Sad to say I don't think I'll be back, unless it's to order some maduros to go.
4	We bought a Groupon.  I hadn't been here in about 8-9 years.  For her, it was her first time visit.This is some really good food, we just wish it were closer.  The plantains were awesome, the rice and beans delish and the mojito had me thinking I was sitting right in Havana.The menu is long and a little confusing!  But don't worry - just ask the wait staff for the more popular items on the menu or ask the wait staff for advice.  They were helpful and gracious.  We started off with the appetizer sampler which had a little of everything.  Since I am a creature of habit, I ordered my favorite Cubano Sandwich and she order a chicken dish.  Both were wonderfully prepared and tasty.This restaurant is a treat and a gem. The parking lot is small and it's easy to miss.  Also the bathroom is outside the restaurant which only adds to the quaintness of the place. I have only patronized the location on Camelback and never tried the one on Bell.  If you want something different, then go.  You won't be disappointed and it will be a unique experience.
2	I don't have a problem paying $60-$80 for two, but when its worth it.  I think if it wasn't ridiculously over-priced it might have been a better experience.  I'm South American, grew up with Caribbean-Latin American food and I've had better.  But if you've never had Cuban, Puerto Rican or any Latin food; then I guess at least try it once.
5	"But I took three years of Spanish and I can't understand anything!" - said my friend. It's not necessary here. Irma was helping us. When I pulled her over to inquire why she was going to cry, it was because a patron couldn't possibly eat his postre. (A general word for dessert.) Irma, our amazing server, laughed when I said I'd take his dessert. This is very laid back, chill place serving authentic food in an unassuming place.I miss hearing my parents and family banter in their Colombian selves. Cubans apparently mix and mingle in a similar fashion. Irma wove her magic throughout the restaurant, smiling and laughing. Quite possibly the happiest woman in Phoenix. (Eventually a delicious red sangria was selected, which went down entirely too fast.)But back to the menu. The menu is clear to understand to anyone, from any corner of the world. Yes, I had a head start as many of the dishes share palates with Colombia. However, the menu here is clearly translated into English for anyone to decipher. No need to fret. And if you're overwhelmed by choices, there are two things that might help you order. Forks designate "Havana Signature Items". Additionally you can opt for a Combination or Sampler plate. It's for the "I Just Don't Know" moments.SEATINGI came here the night someone had their wedding reception! So yes, Havana Cafe readily can accommodate groups. With charm, sincerity and the utmost attention they can provide wonderful service to a party of two. We arrived separately on a Tuesday night around 6-ish pm. Patrons started to trickle in more so around 7pm. Upon arriving I learned there wasn't really a bar area to wait for my friend to arrive. No matter, I was promptly seated even though my party had not fully arrived.FOODEager to eat we ordered fried plantains. When offered an option as to how they were prepared, I jumped and asked for Tostones. The pounded green ones (vs. the sweet kind.) Salty, but not too salty, served with a side of mojo-garlic lime sauce. My mom and aunt prepare them slightly crispier, but these were still delicious.For a meal the Ropa Vieja was divine. Humongous, but delicious. Shredded beef brisket, bell peppers, onions, tomato wine sauce and black beans over rice. I was surprised by the difference in texture of the onions on the rice vs. the brisket. It was nice to have a sweet, fresh onion on the rice. The brisket had a blended texture of spices with the vegetables. (Enough left overs for two more meals. But I'm a girl eating 3 ounces of protein in a meal.)The night was young, and ma ' belly was full. The flan looked tempting. I'll have to send a recon mission back just for that!And yes, the leftovers were excellent :)
4	The pumpkin bisque is freakin delicious. Took a pint home and froze it to eat for later! Not the friendliest of service, but they def take care of you. Try a mojito too.
5	Sadly, the original location is closing, leaving the NE Phoenix restaurant the only one left.
1	What a disappointment! I had been wanting to come here for months. The service was embarrassingly bad. Despite the empty tables, there were 3 different groups waiting at least 15minutes to be seated. Everyone in the restaurant seemed to be looking around for their waiter/waitress and looking generally displeased. We requested one of the several tables outside and were told by the surly hostess that we couldn't...because the tables were dirty (and she didn't want to clean them, presumably?). Our drink order was taken and then a clueless waiter came back to re-take it. When he returned, he'd already forgotten my drink order and had to go back the bar to make it. We then saw two of the servers get into an argument in front of us. Every table is supposed to get bread and we asked several people for ours when after 30 minutes, we still didn't have it. One waitress even told us, "I'm sure it's baking right now."
