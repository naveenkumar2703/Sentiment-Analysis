4	Fish n Bowl is a hidden Japanese restaurant located along Durango and Warm Springs (beside Sonic Burger). From outside you wouldn't know that it's a Japanese restaurant.The place is clean and very bright. The decorations are very Japanese. We ordered the following:Fried Octopus Salad Bowl - I loved the yuzu salad dressing. Everything blended well with this entree. My only complaint is the price. The salad was not very much and they put it in a giant bowl, with a few pieces of fried octopus. The octopus was cooked well. For $9.50, it looks over-priced.Bacon Tempura- My favorite among all the dishes we ordered.  It came probably with approximately 8 pieces of small cut bacon with tempura batter. The batter was really good since it had seasoning on it. A must try and something different. Cajun Albacore Nigiri - the fish was fresh and seasoned well. The fish was also a good size. Rock n Roll - again, the fish was fresh. The presentation was pretty. The flavor was good. Hamachi Taco - I guess this is the most famous dish. It was good but there's a tad sweetness that comes with it that doesn't seem to go along with the dish. My bf said it was probably from the red onions. Spicy Hamachi Roll - pretty good size for the price, 8 pieces for $4.50. Average roll.Ginger Ice Cream - something unique and good. It's a good palate cleanser. Service was awesome. We will be back!
5	Really enjoyed this place; especially the Chirashi Bowl and Tuna Poke Taco. The fish was all really fresh and delicious.
4	Friendly, quaint restaurant with some basic and delicious dishes. It's small with about 25 seats or so, and one chef.  We surprised the chef by bringing half our office here and spending a couple hours trying everything they had. Understandably he was swamped but he still delivered good food at a good price. I tried: Uni in a spoon - fresh, tasty, great pricePork Belly - the meat itself is tender, but the flavor is okay - too much of the burnt marinade taste for my likingBacon Tempura - actually pretty tastyTacos (Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Snapper) - 3 bite-sized tacos to an order, yellowtail was my favoriteSalmon Ochazuke - Excellent. I'll come back just for this.Branzino (Weekly Special) - It was marinated in dill, grilled so the skin was extra crispy, served on peppers and onions, and was delectable. Perfectly cooked.Warm Springs roll - I normally don't like rice paper rolls but this is great. Overall this restaurant has fresh fish, good service, and some great morsels to try. I'll be coming here for lunch more often!
5	This place is really good, I have tried about 6 different items and I thought they were all tasty.   I kind of don't want anyone to know about it because it's like my little secret, oh we'll secret out!  Good food should be recognized! ENJOY!The pork belly is goodBacon tempura amazing!!Tacos are nice and crispyAnd the chef is nice and so is the lady that always serves us. Kind of seems like a 2 man team everytime I go. Just love this place.
4	Came here after seeing Julie L.'s check in. I saw her pic of the salmon tacos and it definitely peaked my interest. I assumed this place was more like a Japanese tapas place but I think it centers more on the sushi side. I came around noon on Saturday for lunch and the place was empty. Service was delightful. The lady always made sure our water cups were full and the sushi chef made sure we liked our food. Anyways, on to the stuff we ordered-salmon poke tacos: Price was $9.50 for 3 tacos. The shells were actually fried won ton skins which I thought was a very neat idea and also gave it a nice crunch. They were filled to the brim with sliced pieces of salmon and covered in a yummy sauce. I could've ate these all day.-Tonkatsu bowl: Price was $9.50. Came with a large slice of tonkatsu, rice, pickled veggies, sauce, and a bowl of miso soup. Nothing too spectacular about this. Probably wouldn't get this again-Pork belly appetizer: This was very tasty. Grilled pork belly covered in a ginger/sesame/honey sauce. Can't go wrong with this!Overall, this place is a little pricey but you just have to order the right stuff (ahem tacos). Fish is fresh so maybe go towards the fish items.
3	This is next door to my one of my favorite bakeries, Suzuya, so I decided to stop in and try them out prior to dessert. It was taco Tuesday, instead of going with the  Mexican route, I wanted Yellowtail Poke Tacos. These were really good, but 3 for $10 was a bit steep, they were really small and left me hungry, so I ordered the Sushi A combo, it came with 5 pieces of nigiri & california roll along with miso soup and a small salad for $8.50. Can't beat that! Ended the meal with Monaka Ice Cream, I've seen these at International Market, I'm sure that's where they are getting them, I doubt these are made in here. This wasn't a bad find, overall sushi wasn't bad, not the best. The setup was a bit bizarre, instead of having chairs up against the sushi bar, they have tables up against it, and then chairs around that? Different. Good luck to them, I always like to see local places succeed.After thought-they have a restaurant.com voucher available.
5	My first time eating at this place. This place looks very clean with friendly owners. Bacon tempura was delicious. I had the salmon poke bowl and I loved it. The fish and green veggies seemed fresh and had just a good amount of spice in it. I would definitely come back to this place to explore more food in the menu.
5	Still a huge fan - I've now also had the tonkatsu bowl and kalbi bowl, and everything's been amazing.
5	Yum! Roe Festival Salad is super delicious if your a roe fan like me. The Salmon Oh Cha Zuke was excellent too. The miso soup was great too . Fresh, delicious and super healthy! Friendly service too!
4	After seeing the photos of the bacon tempura, we had to give this place a try! We ordered that, the yellowtail poke tacos, grilled salmon ochazuke, short rib bowl, and Mexican sushi roll. Everything was good, but the bacon tempura and salmon ochazuke were definitely my faves!The service was great and the restaurant was modern, clean and they played awesome late 80's/early 90's music, which we loved!I wish I could give them 4 1/2 stars. I just rarely give 5 stars. But I'd definitely go back!
5	Super yummy! We had the bacon tempera, diakon radish salad, yellowtail tacos, Cajun albacore and kalbi bowl. All good! For dessert we had monaka ice cream. We will be coming back :) the service was very friendly and prompt too!
5	Delicious we had spicy Hirame  spicy yellowtail sashimi plate.  We reorder them.  We also tried Kali bowl tender rib meat with a sweet tangy sauce.  Family owned.
4	This little hole in the wall sushi place is very interesting. The food is a little over priced, but very good. We tried the yellow tail taco which was very good but was 3 small pieces. We also tried the kalbi bowl which came in a huge bowl, but the plus was that they took the bones completely off. The atmosphere was great and I loved how there was only one chef and one waitress because they were super friendly and attentive.
5	Me and my girlfriend were craving something that didn't have red meat (since we've been trying to cut down), so we stumbled upon this place on yelp. First off I must say, the chef was friendly and had great service! We started off with the oyster in a spoon and seaweed salad. Oysters were delicious that was basking in a ramekin full of ponzu sauce. Then we went onto the lollie rice Bowl which had crab,  shrimp, masago, lettuce, and rice. Very well rounded and delicious. Sushi was superb, had 2 orders of yellowtail nigiri, each a different cut of the fish. Had a couple of rolls, eel and the philly. The amount they gave was good (8 pcs.) compared to the price ($4.50).We had an off the menu dessert - the monaka - green tea ice cream with red bean inside of a wafer. Oiishi! Total bill - $43Satisfaction: obtained10/10 would eat again!
5	ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW: NOM.COM -- at great prices!! If you're looking for somewhere to eat that's delicious and affordable, this is your place! If ya need some convincing, read on.First thing I noticed about this place was the unassuming location. It's overshadowed in a little corner by a car-filled Sonic, so aside from the cute sign, it could easily be overlooked. We went in and were seated at a table in front of the chef, which was awesome because he was able to help us out with the menu and he was really friendly and easy to talk to.We started off with some seafood salad and yellowtail nigiri. For me, yellowtail is a deal breaker--but this yellowtail was SO delicious, I could have ordered a plate full! Then we ordered the oysters in a spoon, never had raw oysters in ponzu with wasabi and the flavors went so well together. We also order the Lollie bowl that had shrimp, crab, masago over some shredded lettuce. AMAHHZING! We also had the eel roll, which was so worth the $4.50!We ordered another order of yellowtail nigiri before getting dessert. We ordered the monaka, green tea ice cream with a little bit of red bean enclosed in a nice flaky wafer. So good we had to order 2!I love this place! The prices are amazing, quality was great, and service was tops! We'll definitely be coming back for more!
4	**Summary**       - Decor - It's definitely a small hole in the wall place. However bright colors and decor make it feel modern.       - Taste - The food is good and fresh for the most part. Other than the pork belly, I would get everything again.       - Value - The prices are a bit high compared to their portions. It's like a French place - small portions, but good.**Ordered**       - $4.50 Uni in a Spoon - Uni with lemon juice & sea salt (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish-n-bowl-las-vegas-2?select=Ro-d2BTAZduAt50YdlH9LA#Ro-d2BTAZduAt50YdlH9LA).       - $9.50 Tuna Poke Tacos - Spicy tuna cubes in a crispy taco shell. Pretty delicious (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish-n-bowl-las-vegas-2?select=PCF4iArhFXVXWRDl7c71nw#PCF4iArhFXVXWRDl7c71nw).       - $9.50 Seared Beef Salad Bowl - The seared beef came out a little more rare than I expected, but it was still good. The sauce is like a ponzu sauce, but spicier (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish-n-bowl-las-vegas-2?select=0LztZ6afnpjte2aOscFDDA#0LztZ6afnpjte2aOscFDDA).       - $9.50 Sex on the Beach Roll - Assorted fish with ponzu sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish-n-bowl-las-vegas-2?select=Z3Q7R_XvBx4Bg94dpOhcPg#Z3Q7R_XvBx4Bg94dpOhcPg).       - $5.50 BBQ Pork Belly - Expected a bit more seared. It didn't look too appetizing, but it wasn't terrible (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish-n-bowl-las-vegas-2?select=LPuuDavpDeZE4IEKZGPPpw#LPuuDavpDeZE4IEKZGPPpw).       - $3.50 Monaka - Green tea ice cream surrounded by a waffer cookie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish-n-bowl-las-vegas-2?select=BYVMe5mASDtYj86a9kPe2g).**Recommendations**       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice date place. It'd say it's Japanese tapas with their portion size.
4	I never thought this small sushi bar around the corner from my house would be so delicious.  Fish N Bowl is a quaint sushi bar on S. Durango behind a Sonic and near a Jiffy Lube.  Since it opened, we passed by without thinking of stopping in because of the size and location.  After a long day, we wanted sushi on the way home and were too far away from our usual all-you-can-eat place.  On a whim, we stopped by Fish N Bowl and were the first for dinner.  We were warmly greeted and our drinks and menus arrived quickly.The restaurant is sweet, with nice decor and nice seating.  The walls have nice, big boards with unique rolls and desserts.  The tables even have suggestions for those new to sushi bar offerings.  The menu is unique in terms of appetizer and roll offerings.  The prices are also very reasonable.  We went ahead and started off with some familiar dishes and unique ones.  With the sushi and sashimi meal that I chose, I received some miso soup and a simple cabbage salad.This salad looks simple, but the dressing is just fantastic.  It's a Kewpie and citrus salad dressing that's poured on just right so as to not soak the crunchy cabbage.  I ate the entire bowl and wanted more, but we had a few appetizers to go through before our main sushi meals.The shrimp tempura arrived with something that I haven't seen before--salt and lemon.I know what you're thinking, where's the ponzu?  Trust me--this only needed the salt and lemon to dip.  The tempura itself is crispy, seasoned well, and with some lemon to wet the tempura for the salt to stick, it makes a salty, citrus taste that doesn't make me miss the tempura sauce.  With this and the salad as a great start, I was looking forward to the pork belly. It isn't sauce-soaked or super tender, but it is perfect in every way.  I always look for that pork belly grilled just to the point where the fat renders, but still has that chew to it because that's what good pork belly is all about.  This is salty, nutty, and hearty.  I could eat four of these alone and be happy.Last, but not least, was the unique offer on their apps list--tempura bacon with maple soy sauce.  It sounds weird, but it's so good.  Imagine, if you will, tempura for breakfast.  This would be the thing I'd taste when dreaming of something like tempura breakfast--a thinly sliced pork belly deep fried in a tempura batter that's super spicy, served with the craziest sauce--a maple soy dip.  It's like eating tempura pork belly pancakes that are spicy, sweet, salty, and crispy.  It melts in the mouth, has a good crispy exterior and a nice, soft pork belly interior.  The pieces are paper thin, making it easy to eat.  The best part is dipping each piece in that maple soy sauce, which is sweet and smokey, replicating that maple syrup and pancake experience, but in the weirdest and best way possible.  Following my finger licking was a plate of nigiri and a few pieces of tuna sashimi. you don't choose what you are given for this combination, but who cares!  The nigiri is delicious and a great sample of the fish available to eat.  The tuna melts in the mouth, the yellowtail is delicious, and everything tastes fresh.  The rice was a bit hard in some pieces, but the flavors were there.  What a great meal for $10.50!I never imagined that coconut shrimp, coconut flakes, avocado and yum yum sauce would ever go together, but this roll was absolutely tasty.  The crunchy shrimp inside had that hint of coconut flavor along with the coconut flakes, and the cream cheese with the avocado gave that creamy, filling flavor, with the yum yum sauce as a great tangy counterbalance to the richness of all the other ingredients.  The over textures and flavors were so surprising, and in the best way possible.  I would order this time and again because it had everything I love in one roll.  What a success.I'm thankful that I can satisfy my cravings just by driving 2 minutes or less to Fish N Bowl, a sweet, small restaurant tucked away behind a Sonic and Jiffy Lube on S. Durango.  I hope it remains a tucked away secret so I am able to get a table as easily as I did today.  Shh--don't tell anyone I told you about Fish N Bowl.  Let's just keep this gem between you and me.
5	Very fresh and tasty. Great service. We will be back:)
5	Surprisingly good despite the location. Uni and oyster in spoon is very good. Although the restaurant state it is a fusion style restaurant but some items are pretty authentic. Chef is very friendly especially to kids. Will definitely come back again
5	Very good fresh fish!! I am very picky because I'm from San Diego but I really liked this place
5	fave sushi spot to go to in vegas !! food is prepared carefully, fresh, and delicious. love the owners, such nice kind people. I get to have yummy sushi and feel at home, without the craziness of a sushi spot like the majority in town. definitely a MUST !
2	Nothing really to rave about. I had the Lollie rice Bowl, which was pretty good.  Poke tacos are way over rated.. too sweet.  I doubt we'll be back knowing that for what we paid, could easily go to an ayce sushi place.  But I had to try this place out.
4	Came here for lunch after some work on a Tuesday afternoon. Was MY first time but friend has been here before. The chef/owner recognized her and remembered her style of drink (water with no ice) AND name ! She was surprised XD I had ordered their F&B Chirashi Bowl while my friend had ordered a Salmon Poke Salad and a spicy yellowtail roll. F&B Chirashi Bowl - $10.50 - My friend had said another friend had liked the chirashi here. In terms of raw fish eating experience, it was someone I had trusted on their judgement in this area. Fish n Bowl offers two different bowls. This F&B Chirashi Bowl and the traditional chirashi bowl. The F&B sounded more interesting (had sweet egg) so decided to try their "special" take on the traditional chirashi bowl. This comes with a bowl of miso soup, as well as a side of pickled daikon. When the bowl came, the bowl was big ! The amount of food was, a little uh disappointing. Lol. Reminded me like one of those high end restaurants that uses a big bowl/plate, and put a little food. Was a little saddening. XD Japanese sushi rice on the bottom, fish on top, with finely sliced sweet egg around the edges (refer to picture). The fishes iirc was tuna, salmon, and maybe red snapper? The fish was dressed in a spicy sweet sauce with diced pickled veggies (added crunchy/crispy texture). Not what i expected the variation of Chirashi to be. Thought it would be something along the lines of maybe different fish, toppings, or what not. It was still delicious and surprisingly spicy. Salmon Poke Salad - This is what my friend got ... in a general sense, its similar to the chirashi bowl, but instead of rice, the fish is on a bed of fresh spring salad, and topped with slices of avocado. This is, in terms for poke/chirashi, its pretty spicy as well. Flavor very similar if not the same as the F&B chirashi bowl. Spicy Yellowtail Roll - Came in 8 pieces. Spicy as well. I feel like the chef is using a general spicy sauce for all his recipes. It was kind of hard for my to tell the difference on the spicy flavor between the 3 items. Normally i wouldn't mind spicy (actually prefer spicy) but it seemed to have covered a lot of the natural flavor of various items, esp the fish. Overall, decent place. Service was great. Very attentive. Would like to try other things next time !
1	Tried this place for the first time. Good menu but super slow service. I ordered 2 rolls and it took 35min. I had to ask for napkins and a soy sauce bowl. maybe because it was dinner time but there is only 6 tables. Food was delicious.
4	Fish n Bowl caught me by surprise!  Just in time for lent too.  Although I did come here on a day I could bite into the spicy bacon appetizer.  It's like crispy bacon chips and I've concluded that it would be good paired with the ginger ice cream. I'm going to try that combination when I go there for next time.  My hubs and I always want to try a little of everything and I think we did, except they forgot to take our taco order!  It's okay, the amount of food they give you is a lot and you actually start to get full when trying all the dishes.  I did sashimi, the salads, appetizers and dessert.  I did the sashimi salad and you get a lot.  It's a full serving of a salad for one person and the garlic ponzu sauce is delicious and spicy.  You really get your money's worth!Service was great but it is a tiny spot.  Think a tiny cafe size.  Can't wait to return and try another good dish!
5	This place is about 5 minutes from our house and i ALWAYS pass by it with my commute to work. It's kind of located in a teeny little plaza that includes a bakery and nail salon but whatever because it's DELICIOUS. The owner/chef was there with a really sweet waitress. I think we came in about an hour and a half before they close but they were still so accommodating. They had top 40 music playing on an iPod dock and my bf really appreciated the tv's that were on ESPN (lol!) The restaurant has a modern vibe with light colored wood floors and brightly colored walls. It's minimal and CLEAN. Just how I like my restaurants to be. We ordered their F&B Roll, yellowtail tacos, a rice bowl (rice, some kind of meat-forgot what it was,sorry!!, and their cabbage salad), and the monaka ice cream.Yellowtail Tacos: OMG. I could eat these everyday of my life. The fish was lightly coated in a creamy wasabi sauce with crispy cabbage and black sesame seeds. I don't exactly know what seasoning they used or what they mixed the wasabi with but the whole thing was SOOOO good. The only bad thing i can say about them is the fact they only come with three to an order :( I would eat like.... 9237965. F&B Roll: What the heck is there not to like about this. Fresh coconut shavings, coconut shrimp and cream cheese (loved the fact that there wasn't an obnoxious amount because cream cheese could get ugly.....fast). Perfect rice to filling ratio. Quite possibly the best roll i've ever had the pleasure of consuming. I'm a fan of coconut sooooo if you're not, then don't order it. More for me!  :DBowl: I completely forgot what meat was in this (thats what midterms will do to you) but I just remember it being SO flavorful and tender! The rice was perfect and the cabbage salad was dainty but with that sauce they top it off with, YUUUM. Monaka Ice Cream: green tea ice cream and red bean paste enveloped in a crispy mochi pocket. UMMM yes. As we were walking out, the owner asked how everything was and we assured him we will be back for more and he told us to order their bacon tempura next time. Their what?!? BACON TEMPURA. we almost sat back down just order to it, lol.
4	This place has caught my eye and I've been wanting to try it for awhile. It's a small place but I liked the ambiance. There were only two people other people there so there was no wait on a Friday night. I didn't know exactly what to expect except I knew there was fish. The menu had a lot of different options from appetizers, salad, rolls and sashimi. If your kid doesn't like sushi or seafood this is not the place to take them as there is no other option like tempura udon, etc.  We started off with the uni spoon, oyster spoon and pork belly. My favorite was the uni spoon! It was creamy and delicious. Who knew I would like gonads so much?! ;) the oysters had a nice flavor to it too but I preferred the uni. The pork belly was super super fatty. It was good for what it was but I felt like I was consuming so much fat! Now the chirashi bowl had nice big cuts of fish! The fish was good, but I do wish they put a lil more rice for those hungry hippos like me. Overall, the experience was great. Customer service was good and everything came out fairly quickly. We left spending about $50 bucks for everything which is about average on sushi. I would def come back though.
2	We were really looking forward to our dining experience here; unfortunately, the service was so slow, we almost fell asleep until the holy terror of all toddlers walked in. We ordered 2 rolls, and 2 appetizers; big mistake...it took the chef over an hour to make that happen and everyone acted like this was normal. There were only a few people in the restaurant when we walked in, and it looked like one of the tables had already been served. The staff is very friendly, and the food is amazing; it's a real shame that the service is really *that* slow.I also wish the staff would grow a back bone, and ban rude patrons. There was a very lazy and inattentive mother who texted the entire time she was there, ignoring her toddler who literally stomped her feet as loud as she could back and forth through the restaurant, annoying other patrons, yelling at her mom. At one point, the child walked into the kitchen, seriously?? I wanted to get up from my table, and go stomp my feet as loud as I could right back at the mom to drive my point through her feeble skull. Fish N Bowl, I hope you guys can fix these issues, because we'd love to return for more awesome eats. Oh and btw, everywhere throughout the restaurant, the word "sweat" should be "sweet." Sweat Tea does not seem very appetizing. ;)
5	Too soon to give this place a 5/5? NopeHaving majority of my friends living on the lower half of the 215 is really a pain in meeting up with them. But the drive was worth this time. The following items are ordered between 2 visits. NOT A ONE TIME VISIT. I'm not THAT fat. Lawlz.Pork Belly - Yum! Meat - fat ratio: 1:1Chicken Kaarage - Not too much breading and still could taste the chicken not the breading.Tuna Roll - Fresh fishPorkcutlet Rice Bowl - It's like any katsu but the breading is good, not too much.Salmon Rice Bowl - Grilled salmon on rice, with furikake and hot tea. It looked like a soup or taste like one. But the idea is cool. Sashimi Rice Bowl - an orgy of dead raw fish....that's fresh to the taste!Service is great. They remembered me because of my tattoo on my arm. Kinda awkward but that's okay. If you check in you can get a free drink. Sodas, tea or lemonade. Big plus for their English Bulldog stuff animal by the door. I would come back here if I happen to be in the area.
5	Great little sushi place with friendly service. Crispy spicy bacon tempura was very tasty. I loved the tuna salad on a tomato. Rainbow roll was eye pleasing and delicious. Everything was fresh and well prepared. Love this place.
4	Staff was friendly. Place was small and clean. Food was well prepared. Poke Tacos are a MUST! Sushi is small but that's ok. I would recommend this place for lunch versus dinner unless you want a bite that's not so filling. I ordered 9 items for a family of 4 and we were not full at all. I would go back for sure!!
5	I've passed by this place so many times and for the longest time I thought it was an aquarium store....it's not lol. First off, this is a family owned and operated joint, my kind of place. Nothing fancy or a chain restaurant, just a very cozy hole in the wall place. Like all sushi places, they have their own speciality rolls, but this place has other options besides just sushi. Me and my friend decided to order a bunch of different things and just eat off each other's plate. I highly reccommend the tacos. We had four different options of fish to choose from, so we went with the ahi and yellowtail. The ahi has a pomegranate sauce that isn't that sweet and doesn't over power the fish. The yellowtail has a wasabi aioli that definitely makes the dish. For the sushi rolls you gotta try the Cinco de Mayo. A bit of warning though, it is pretty spicy. It's an ahi roll with a fresh jalepeno and lime sauce. There are so many levels of flavor in this roll that it completely caught me off gaurd, but in a good way, and then you have the jalepeno to finish it off with some heat. My friend and I ordered so much that by the end of the meal I felt like a gullutonous piece of dung lol. I couldn't stop eating, IT WAS SO GOOD, and fresh too! We didn't realize that they closed at 9pm and we were still eating at 9:30, but never once did they try to hurry us up and kept a smile on their faces the whole time. The food is amazing, the service is amazing, and over all the experience was nothing short of amazing. I highly recommend.
5	Really great place! All the food was amazing, The Tuna & Jalapeno  sashimi is a must have. The green tea was very good, try it!I really appreciate the service that I received. It was fast and the server really went out of her way to provide great service. I also appreciate the Chef's effort to appease our picky son's taste buds with the sticky rice he brought. Customer service and food quality through the roof!We will be back :)
5	I don't know what the atmosphere is like because someone picked it up but the food was outstanding. I had the Poke Salad Bowl, it was very flavorful and fresh. The prices were very fair.  I will definitely be coming back to try things.
4	my husband and I had lunch here.cute place, like cafe.sushi was fine. tonkatsu was different from Japanese one but still good.
4	I was in the area and wanted sushi so, I came here. It's a very small place that can only seat about 20-30 people. I love the display in their glass counter once you walk in. Totoro, sushi and Lego Yoda - these are a few of my favorite things. When the dog bites, when the bee stings, when I'm fee...They have specials on the board behind the sushi bar. Their items are ala carte. Sorry, AYCE fans.Uni Trio:Uni in a spoon, uni dumpling and uni handroll. If you like uni, you'll appreciate having uni served three ways. The uni was of good quality. 5/5Buffalo Oyster:Fried oysters tossed in sweet and sour kochujang on a bed of greens. The oysters were tender and not overly fried. The sauce that coated them was a bit spicy and tangy, and quite interesting. 3/5Salmon Poke Tacos:Chunks of salmon with mango jalapeno, red onion, red tobiko and sesame seeds. This was refreshing. They sell poke taco platters! 4/5Warm Springs Roll:Spicy soft-shell crab, cucumber, avocado, and eel sauce. The soft-shell crab was chopped up and I didn't like that too much. 3/5XXX Roll:Soft-shell crab, spicy tuna, spicy crab, shrimp tempura, rice paper, avocado, eel sauce, sriracha, and spicy yum sauce. No rice. The rice paper made it a bit difficult to get from the plate - each piece was sticking to the next piece or the plate. But was it good? Why, yes! It was a bit sweet and a lot spicy. 4/5Cherry Blossom:Crab meat wrapped with salmon, no rice. I love non-rice options since I don't enjoy rice at all. 4.5/5Monaka Ice Cream:Green tea ice cream with a layer of red bean paste inside a wafer. A dessert that isn't too sweet. Easy to eat and isn't messy. 4/5My cup of hot water for my green tea was never empty. This place is bright and just delightful!
5	Really cute place, superb service and amazing poke bowl! Ordered poke bowl and salad, one of the freshest we've had! Drive worth it and will definitely be coming back!
5	The shrimp tempura is the best here!! Light, and crispy!  Salad bowl with salmon is very yummy...  We will always come back!
4	CONDENSED IN A SOUP CAN: If you are in the area, give it a go.  THE MEAT: It's a tiny, bright and clean space with matching genuinely warm stellar service.  We had the Kalbi bowl and Pork Tonkatsu (ok but not very memorable), the Pork Belly appetizer (this had definitely more of fusion than Japanese flavors, it was tasty), the Cherry Blossom which has tons of crab inside and on top salmon sashimi wedges and is a no rice roll (sashimi and crab are some of my fave things but this roll lacks texture, it was mush inside mush), the Cinco de Mayo Roll which has shrimp, avocado, tuna with a sweet wasabi drizzle and microgreen cilantro (if you like shrimp rolls and cilantro, you'll like this and it has lots of great texture... but it's supposed to be spicy and there was hardly any heat, so if you like things fiery, ask them to crank up the heat.)Since it's in my area, the fish is fresh and the service is da bomb, I'll go back to try out the nigiri, the bacon tempura that everyone is raving about and a few more menu items.  There is room for streamlining their extensive menu but there is promise in the creativity and good vibes in this place.P.S. No uni that day coz of bad storms in CA, call ahead to find out what's fresh/available.  We'll be back!
3	3.5The first time we came here the service was soooooooooooooo slow and the server was a bit awkward,.. We ordered a bunch of things and nothing stood out and the sashimi was not that fresh..Fast forward to my most recent visit... The service improved tremendously! Food came out at a good pace and the same server was on her A game.. I tried the uni trio which was $15 and well worth it! Comes with uni sashimi, uni potsticker and uni hand roll... The uni was fresh and I thought it was super creative to put it in potsticker form..My only gripe with this place would be that prices seem to be reasonable but the portions are pretty small.. My boyfriend ordered the Galbi bowl on our most recent visit and he could definitely not get full on that alone!But I will be back for the uni trio!!! YUMMMM
4	I can't remember the name of the last business that was in this location, but it sucked.  I guess because of that, I didn't even think about coming in here until I saw the Yelp rating.  I'm glad I did.  The hamachi tacos were great.  I could eat about a dozen of those for starters.  The tonkatsu was ok, nothing special.  They had a bunch of other stuff on the menu that looked good, but I'll have to wait for my next visit.
5	This place is really a find.  The freshness of the fish in the sushi is awesome. And the chef is very inventive with influences from Japan (obviously) and Hawaii.I had the chirashi, and the price is very reasonable for the amount and quality of what you receive.  The fish was excellent.My wife had sushi-B, and it was quite good, although I thought the California rolls were just average.We finished our meal with the monaka ice cream, which was the first time I'd tried it.  Really good!
4	Another solid hole in the wall sushi place I like to call "On the other side of town". Since I live in North Las Vegas, not sure about driving all the way across town to eat here. Surely though it will be noted any time im in the area because there are lots of other great options around here too!Odd story of how got here. My oldest son was feenin for Poke but a couple of places we checked out were closed already. Not to say that this place was an after thought but I wanted some poke too.So what we got was a Tuna Poke Salad ($9.50), Barbequed Pork Belly ($5.50), Spicy Bacon Tempura ($4.50), and a Cut Roll Combo ($8.50).The Tuna Poke Salad was as advertised. Niblets of Ahi, Spring Mix, Avocado, and Spicy Yum Sauce. The yum sauce was actually pretty spicy. Had to wipe the sweat off my forehead a couple times.The Barbequed Pork Belly is grilled with a tangy sweet soy sauce and topped off with green onion. A little bit chewy but at the same time it pretty tender if there is such a description. Its basically a very thick cut of bacon that has been has the sauce mentioned above brushed on while being grilled. Love the combination of sweet and salty of the pork.The Spicy Bacon Tempura. Cut up pieces of bacon dipped in a spicy tempura batter and deep fried to crispiness. Comes with a maple syrup type of sauce to dip in. Again, a nice combination of sweet and salty.Cut Roll Combo. Your choice of any two regular rolls on the menu accompanied by cup of miso soup. My Roll choices were the Spicy Califonia Roll and the Spicy Salmon Roll. Both are self explanatory and def had a bit of a spicy kick to it.Service was excellent even though we were the only ones there. I assume if it was busier the service would be a bit slower but that's understandable.Overall, I had a good experience but the only thing that might be a slight turnoff are the portions. Some of the items we had seemed tiny on the plates it came on. Other than that, the taste, service, and ambiance are all noteworthy.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #127 "You do the Ahi Poke and you turn yourself around......."
5	Update - Had a business lunch here recently, and I have to admit I was a little worried. Fish N Bowl impressed me this time! Everything was perfect, I will return.
3	Decent takeout sushi place- was originally planning to dine in, but there weren't any other customers at 3PM and I was there solo, which seemed a little awkward. The lady on register and gentleman chef were very polite and friendly, I believe they are the husband and wife owners, though we didn't talk shop.Opted for two of the specialty rolls: the Red Rock (spicy yellowtail and cucumber topped with avocado, spicy garlic ponzu, and green onion) and the Mexican (spicy crab, shrimp, cucumber, topped with avocado, sriracha, and green onion)- can you tell I like green onion? Oddly though, the Mexican roll did not have onion topping. Red Rock roll is spicy- I asked to sub regular yellowtail instead of the spicy and could not tell if this had been done, it was still quite hot to me and I'm not particularly sensitive to spice. Rolls themselves were slightly smaller than expected, but fish and other ingredients were fresh and the creamy taste of the avocado topping the Mexican roll balanced out the heat of the Red Rock.Will have to return to try the chirashi or the poke salad bowls- green monster roll also caught my eye!
5	I was turned off at first when I realized there was no "all you can eat," but I decided to stay and order just to try a new place.  The server and the sushi chef were both very friendly but not overbearing. As I  was flipping through the menu I was pleased to see low prices on every dish and some really good deals. The sushi chef saw me looking at the menu for a while and asked if he could make me something not on the menu based on what I liked to eat. I was surprised to have such personal service for such a small place on my first visit. I told him I  wanted something with shrimp tempura and eel and he whipped up this awesome roll that was exactly what I wanted. I haf ni idea fresh water eel could taste that good! I'm definitely going back! Big thank you to the employees and owners for a perfect first experience!
5	Everything I tried in this place was amazing. Highly recommend this place. I had the pork belly which was amazing. Also I had the sex on the beach roll which was so flavorful. Lastly had the poke tacos and those we're very good too. I'm a pretty honest critic when it comes to fish type dishes and I was blown away.
4	Cute neighborhood restaurant. Super tiny but the workers are super nice. It's super clean and the dishes are awesome. I love the uni or oyster In the spoon!
4	I had this spot bookmarked and opted to swing by for lunch. This sushi cafe (small as other reviews stated) is centrally located in the SW of Vegas - off of Durango and 215- and close to my work.I popped by on a Friday afternoon and they offered to sit me at a table right away. They had a few tables open during the lunch rush. I took a peek at the menu and was immediately drawn to their lunch 'box' special. I didn't really give any attention to their regular menu so I can't offer any advice there. However, the lunch special price was $9.50+ tax - done and done! They have you select one HOT option and one COLD option. I opted for the Tempura Veggies (HOT) and Spicy Tuna (COLD) for my choices. I also ordered edamame to munch  on while I waited for my main dish.  Within 5 mins, I was served my edamame and miso soup (included in the special- it was tasty for miso).  My main dish was served promptly after that. I appreciate a place that can serve speedy quality food. This is especially true when you're on your afternoon lunch break. The lunch 'box' special was broken up into 4 sections (see photo). Section 1: The veggie tempura.  It was delish! The veggies weren't soggy and it wasn't overly breaded. I liked that they served it with lemon wedges and sea salt on the side. Section 2: My spicy tuna roll was just as scrumptious. Not a hard roll to screw up- but it was done right. Section 3: Cucumber salad- fresh thinly sliced cucumbers with a vinegar based dressing. It was crispy and crunchy- just as cucumbers should be. Section 4: rice. Yup, a scoop of white rice. Not much else to say. Throw some soy sauce on it and get at it.Overall, I was impressed with my lunch for the value and service. Everything was super fresh and it's nice to try a different lunch spot. I was a happy camper when all was said and done. I will be bringing some fellow coworkers back for a future lunch visit.
4	I've been here many times. Every time it's very good. The fish tastes fresh and their menu is not overwhelmingly big. Our server is very attentive and happy to help. I usually get the chirashi bowl and its perfect amount of sashimi and rice. The rolls are good and their hamachi kama is very tasty. My only complaint is when ordering to go its hard because they dont have a menu online or in yelp that makes it easy. Will definitely be back!
5	This place is a hidden gem! Great customer service and amazing food. This is not an AYCE restaurant fyi. But if you want fresh fish and great Japanese food I would definitely give this spot a try.
4	Very good sushi.  Took the advice and tried the tuna taco.  Happy hour specials from 4pm-6pm.   We will come back and try some new rolls.  The menu has a nice variety.
5	Excellent! This is a true keeper and a must try! The restaurant is clean, modern and new with a casual atmosphere inviting of most any discerning sushi fanatic like myself. The service is top notch with no detail left out.The food quality is superior to most and the preparation with garnish and presentation excellent. It was complimented by a happy hour on rolls to keep the appetite in check.Shall return soon and ready to leave the AYCE crowded stops and return to quality. I must add the prices are more than reasonable, so the pocketbook will be as happy as you are eating here.
4	Everything was amazing. Tacos are out of this world, salad was big and great quality. Going to do take out next time to avoid the fried tempura cheesecake. (So good!)
5	Found this place on Yelp. My boyfriend is always looking for new sushi places for us to try. This is a tiny hole in the wall but man is it a gem! The ahi poke is the best I've had yet! Sushi rolls were loaded and just delicious! We will be back for sure! The young lady who waited the tables always made sure your drink was full and that your food was good and timely. Yum!
3	I was disappointed with the Bacon Tempura & the Pork Belly.  They both felt & looked undercooked. Very concerning & disappointing for a pork lover. I knew something didn't seem right when I picked up my order, the chef looked really nervous. Very strange vibes from him, but the hostess was nice.  The food looks nothing like the pictures, in fact the pork dishes looked microwaved then tossed in sauce.  Hmmm.
2	Saw the reviews & tried this place. Expensive for the small portions received. Pork cutlet was dry and had a strange taste. Tasted like it was pre cooked & then heated. Shrimp tempura was the same. Blah! Sushi was just ok.
5	My favorite place around home by far. Tasty Japanese cuisine and sushi. Service in general is so sweet and thoughtful. I hope this place stays around for a long time, they deserve to.
5	This place is great! NOT AYCE sushi menu. Quality of the rolls and nigiri are worth it. I also leave full, happy, spend as much as the AYCE places.
4	Cute little place...great for kids. High marks for friendly decor, awesome service, and very reasonable prices. The quality of the fish is not great but better than your average AYCE joint and a great value.
2	I'm surprised this place has such great reviews. I thought their rolls lacked lots of flavor and the fish was not fresh at all.
5	Amazing! This place always hits the spot when I am craving something light and fresh. The owners are the cutest couple and have begun to recognize my order every time I call in. Which is rare for a restaurant, and why it is so awesome! Their food is always on point. I typically order the Crispy Rice with Tuna, Shrimp Tempura, Pork Belly, and a Kalbi Bowl. Yes I finish it all and Yes it's the same order everytime! When I do dine in I always love trying their newer menu items, but when it comes down to placing a to go order, it's always the same because they never go wrong. The inside of the restaurant is absolutely adorable. It is a small space but they make the best of it. My favorite is the cash-out section. All the toys and lego's make it so unique. There is even a mini sushi restaurant doll house on the counter that SHE made! Such talent. Def. a must see while you are in there. Well this review made me want to eat there again! Unfortunately they changed their days again to only open Thurs. - Sunday. Which is kind of a bummer, but it does make me wait and crave it even more! Which makes eating there even more of a treat!
4	They have very fresh fish. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They don't have AYCE and they are closed on Tuesday. My favorite item was the uni on a spoon. The yellow tail taco was amazing as well. They offer takeout too.
5	IGreat food, fresh, good service, clean, ample parking. We ordered the warm springs roll, salmon taco, sushi and sashimi, and the rock and roll. Everything was good and the low price made it even better.
5	Why eat fast food when you can have sushi! Always taste fresh, everything is made on the spot. Super quick service, nice people, I've never been disappointed! Try the crispy rice with tuna or salmon, yum!
3	i'd probably give them a 3.5 rating if that was available.the food is decent. Some items didn't seem high quality or fresh. I've gone back a couple of times, but i've never walked out impressed. if i'm in the area and craving some quick sushi type foods, then i'll go here, but i wont' go out of my way for it.
5	Everything was very tasty.  I especially loved the bacon tempura, but all the dishes I've had there are great.
5	My husband and I came here on a Saturday around noon - the place was almost empty. It is small; they have about 6 tables.There is no AYCE but the prices are very reasonable.My husband order one of the lunch specials for 9.50 - chicken, philly roll, cucumber salad, and miso soup - no complaints!Then we shared a Seaweed Salad (it had a funny flavor) and a few no rice rolls (all were $10.50 I believe)Warm Springs roll - yummy!Rock and roll - good but not the best I have had. it seemed smallCherry Blossom - lots of crab!The waitress was very attentive and re-filled our waters regularly.They do have a happy hour from 4 - 6pm, 30% off regular rolls.
