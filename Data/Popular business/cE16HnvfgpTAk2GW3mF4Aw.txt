4	We got passes to Madame Tussauds as part of our package from the Venetian. This "interactive" wax museum is located on The Venetian property and ticket prices are a little more costly than one might think they would be. Also, the museum could be bigger. We made it through the whole thing in about 30 minutes. There are a variety of celebrity wax sculptures and you can touch and pose with all of them for pictures. There are no barriers seperating you from the figures. Look for a coupon before going (or find a package that offers admission to a group of vegas attractions for a discount) and don't forget your camera!
5	In a city where entertainment is a twenty-four-hour industry, it's not surprising that this branch of the world's most famous wax museum would eliminate the royal family members (although Princess Di is on view) and Chamber of Horrors seen in London and the politicians found in New York in order to concentrate on film stars, television personalities, pop music icons, and athletes. Just as in the East Coast outpost, visitors can cozy up to the eerily lifelike figures for photo ops. Monsters Alive! features wax versions of Frankenstein and the Mummy and live actors playing characters such as Dracula and Igor, Marry Clooney! allows women to don wedding finery and pose with bachelor actor George, and wannabe card sharks can pretend to play poker with a chillingly realistic Ben Affleck. A behind-the-scenes look at the lengthy process involved in creating these masterpieces rounds out the exhibit. The $22.95 admission is pricey, so look for discount deals in the many coupon books distributed throughout town.
5	You sure this isn't the real Johnny Depp?This is one of the best places to check out if your in Vegas. You can get discounts on tickets for students (no matter the state), plus if you not a student hotels packages and coupon books usually have a coupon for this place. It's inside the Venetian( a gorgeous hotel) and is somewhat visible from the street. It's located in a tower. They had two wax figures outside the entrance you can pose with. You can touch, kiss, lick, rub,...joking but there is no separation or barriers between you and the figures so you might can do that. Even the ones on the stages you can get on there stages and pose with them. I nearly knocked down Dubya and kicked him in the back because I thought it was him. They are just amazing to look and feel. The best one I think hands-down was Johnny Depp. Tupac (the lastest one as of September 2006) wasn't there because he was visiting London but was expected to return late last year. I had wanted to see his but I was not disappointed with the other figures.  SAY CHEESE!
5	Okay, you've blown the majority of your money on gambling. You're not hungry and it's not club time yet. What are you going to do? Madame Tussaud's!As opposed to other wax museums, this one doesn't take itself seriously. It doesn't even call itself a museum which makes sense, since the entire point of coming here is to take ridiculous pictures of yourself and your friends with wax statues of Johnny Depp and Elvis Presley. They even have props-like bunny ears to wear when you pose with Hugh Hefner.
4	I haven't been to a wax museum in over a decade...I remember when you had to stay behind the velvet rope...the interaction was great!You can curl up next to Hef, try to dunk on Shaq, join the victory at Nascar (with your own flags to wave), but on a dress and pretend to marry Brad (even though the sign says George, it looks a lot more like Brad to me), and...you can touch J Lo's butt and make her blush.  I love that you can get up close with the figures and play along with the Blue Man Group.At $24 a person it is a bit pricey for an hours worth of entertainment...but it was entertaining enough for me to make it worth it.  The haunted house bit is extremely short...it was well done, but maybe a minute from start to finish.They have student discounts, and I've heard there are coupons, so you might want to look for those in advance.  Go in, relax and make a fool of yourself!
5	This place is so fun!! It wouldn't have been fun if you couldn't take any pictures, but let me tell you, there is nothing better than an action shot of me vs. a wax Shaq. It's huge and while there is always a line to get in, once you are in everyone sort of fans out so you don't feel rushed or anything. When I was there in 2004, they had an American Idol stage set up with wax figurines. They pinned numbers on you and encouraged you to sing karaoke. We did and it was pretty fun. It's very family friendly (part of that new Vegas slogan) and anyone can have a blast there. TRUST me. You will not be disappointed!
5	Had an awesome time. Super fun and interactive. :-)I especially enjoyed the haunted portion of the museum. It was fun and scary. Two things I love! I loved posing with Hugh and dancing with Beyonce. I was interviewed by Oprah played a mean game of basketball with Shaq, poker with Ben and I flipped Bush the bird. It was A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!!!
5	This was my favorite wax museum ever!Okay... granted it's only the second one I've ever been to, the first one being the one on Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  But I love the interactiveness of all the statues.First of all, the quality of the statues was amazing.  Most all of them were instantly recognizable.  As I said... the interactive qualities were great.  You could pretty much take a photo with any of the statues (well... it would have been quite an accomplishment to pose with the BIlly Idol on top of a huge speaker).  Some were "interactive" in that there were signs inviting you to interact... the ones I remember were touching Jennifer Lopez' booty to see her face blush (we didn't test this one), marrying George Clooney, shooting hoops with Shaq, putting with Tiger Woods and Arnold Palmer, taking a photo with Hef's arm around you, and sitting at a poker table with Ben Affleck.I was a bit disappointed that the Chamber of Horrors section was live...I really wanted to go in and get photos, but I'm terribly jumpy and don't do well in traditional haunted houses, so I chickened out.We paid for the "Romance Package" through Expedia when booking our trip that included an outdoor gondola ride, admission to Madame Tussauds, and lunch at Zefferino.  All in all I think we saved around $15 doing it that way and it was totally worth it.  I'd have paid full price just for this!
5	Finally a Wax Museum that gets it!!!  I have been to the one's in Hollywood, and in L.A., and in San Fransisco.  LAME!  This place is a one time shot, and or if you ever take someone to Vegas for the "FIRST" time, it is a must STOP!  Why?  Cause it's VEGAS, and this is all goofy and fun!  It rocks, they don't take it serious here, you act like a kid, and you can play with the biggest action figures ever!  You can stand next to, hug, grab, and or put yourself in weird ass positions with some of the most popular figures on Radio, Stage and Screen!  Bring your camera, and have plenty of room.  Because your going to snap off alot of pictures here!  Check it out, and go in the day.  I know your all going to make fools of yourselves at night, and drink it up.  But for that what to do in the day time in Vegas...???  This is a must! :)
5	I was a bit skepical about going to a wax museum but it was a blast! The wax figure look freakishly real and I love how you can interact with them(make J Lo's cheeks blush when you grab her big wax ass lol).I would not recommend coming here without a digital camera and without the intention of posting your pics all over your myspace
5	I've never been to a wax museum like this before!  Totally interactive.  The figures are all posed so that you can stand next to them and be part of the party.  Very clever.  I love how they have various themed areas and you just take your time through each scene.  Most wax museums concentrate on historical figures.  This one is the now.  Want to meet Hugh Hefner?  George Clooney?  Paris Hilton.  They're all there.Best part was that my husband took a picture in the ring with Mohammed Ali, and next thing you know we ran into the real legend himself at the Bellagio later that same afternoon!
5	I grabbed J.Lo's ass, married Clooney, met B. Franklin, G. Washington, got into bed with Hugh Hefner and stared into Brad Pitt's pretty eyes.  Oh, and my cousin got her neck bitten by Siegfried and Roy's tiger.Awesome.  I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy it, but it was a blast-bring your camera, your lidded drink and have a good time!
5	So good..so fun....definitly worth it!!
3	The other posts sum it up pretty well. It's goofy fun with all of your celeb friends. On top of bringing your camera and drink, bring your patience. You're bound to run into inconsiderate people who take 10 minutes with the popular statues. These people are doing multiple poses with different permutations of people in their group.
5	Came over to Las Vegas with the significant other, and stayed at the Venetian. It only made sense to pay a little trip to Madame Tussauds only because it was a 5 min trip from the hotel room. Now I dont find myself a big fan of wax museums, but wow, this place actually proved me wrong.Throughout the museum, there is a plethora of amazingly well done wax clones of celebrities. Although I dont really care for celebrities, I do have fun making a fool out of myself with weird poses. I would have to say that me and Stevie Wonder did form a magical bond during my stay at Madame Tussauds though. All in all, definitely worth the $25
4	If you go to Vegas, you have to see Madame Tussauds at least once. I had never been to a wax museum before, and it was a weird experience looking at something that looks SO real yet I knew it wasn't. Once I got over the mild creepiness of it all I had a lot of fun taking pictures of practically everything. I also got a chance to nerd out and get my picture with Patrick Stewart.The tickets are a little pricey, but you can find coupons practically anywhere.
3	Wow! I'm shocked that this place has landed so many stars. I guess I'm not a tourist attraction type of gal cuz this place did nothing for me. To give it credit, the wax models are done well and the interactive aspect was entertaining but it was all a bit creepy.  So if you are into taking pictures of lifelike clones made of wax, you'll enjoy this place. For me? not so much.
5	Love this place!! Pretty much the same as the one here in Nyc, but with a few added extras such as Hugh Hefner and Elvis that talk! That was really cool! I love the wax museums and had a great time here. Some celebs are dead on and others miss the mark. I hear that if the celeb doesnt put the time in to pose and help make the figure, those are a little off from estimation. You can see that clearly with Julia Roberts, Mel Gibson, etc. Another plus is that its inside the Venetian and I ll use any excuse I can find to get back in there! Lol! Tons of fun. Def do yourself a favor though- when you get to Vegas, take a minute to walk down Las Vegas Blvd near the MGM to the M&M store. Inside that store there is a 1/2 price ticket place. We got our Wax museum tickets for only $18 pp. We also scored dinner passes there for the Todai buffet and the Titanic exhibit- all half price. Def recommened that ticket place to anyone!!! Why pay full price in Vegas when you can see twice as many things!! They also had Cher tickets half off, some Cirque shows and tons of comedy, magicians and restaurants. Would def go there again when Im in town.
5	i can't believe i have never gone to a wax museum. it's definitely a great place to hang out. i mean, with celebs, you know. unlike most museums with a "no touch" policy, you definitely get to interact with the the wax figures, which are very life-like and beautifully constructed. we touched j.lo's butt, joined stevie wonder on the keyboard, sang with prince, pole-danced with britney spears, partied out on the dance floor with b-b-b-b-BEYONCE! AND we got to give bush a good punch. it's definitely pricey. for $25 you really want to walk through the museum at a slow pace AND make sure your camera is LOADED with batteries. the more pictures you take, the "funner" it will be. there's also a scary, haunted exhibit in there. can't tell you about it though, 'cause we chickened out. i know, i know. WUSS. definitely visit this place once in your lifetime before you die. you'll be glad you did. just once.
5	For something I thought was going to be boring, cheesy and not worth the money, I am so happy I was proven wrong!  I'd never been to a wax museum and this exceeded my expectations!  The fact that you got to touch the figures I had no idea!  I heard that the one in NYC didn't allow that and everyone was behind velvet ropes.  That made it even better!  We took pictures with literally every single figure!  I mean, when's the next time I can hug up on a topless Jenna Jameson!?  Angelina and Brad nearby?  I was in heaven!  So many photo ops and so much time!  Well worth the money - and you can get coupons out of any tourist guide that your hotel or cab has!
5	Madame Tussaud's is really a one time only deal. But it is quite fun! During Halloween time (SEPT-OCT) they have a haunted little area you can walk through and people jump out at you. Its hard to tell whether they are wax or fake! You just have to find out on your own! BRING A CAMERA! Tons of great shots with the stars!
4	I loved this wax museum, but i generally LOVE wax museums ... there are kind of my thing. This particular one had a lot of celebrities .. which I liked... the Bragelina figures where quite hilarious because they both had the same dead eyes look that they usually have at movie premieres... hahah. I loved the Hugh Hefner .  Some of the statues were a little odd.. Tom Jones looked terrible , which IS unusual for a celebrated Vegas star. I wish they would of had a culture section with writers (Hello ! Hunter S. Thompson would have been inherently cool and Vegasy) and artists . It's really the only thing this museum lacked. It was great fun taking a wedding picture with George Clooney , I could look into his dead eyes all day. Cheap  afternoon fun on the strip after a late night and early morning of binge drinking. Don't forget your camera for this place.
4	When in Vegas during the cold months, Madam Tussauds is the place to go during the day. I generally avoid Vegas unless it is hot, because Vegas for me equals sitting by pools and drinking during the day. However, I was here for NYE last year, and after waking up, rather hung over, we marched down to the half price tickets to see what there was to do. Madame Tussaud tickets are cheaper if you buy them at this ticket place, so make the hike and do some shopping ;) I have to say there is nothing more fun for a picture whore like myself, than running around a wax museum and taking absurd pictures with the celebrities. Now,, make sure to bring a camera, because posing with these "people" is much more fun if you have picture proof for later mockery. Make sure to have fun with it, because the walk through is amazing if you have a group of people looking at you in horror for grabbing/pinching/licking various body parts for your pictures ;)
2	Does anyone else feel like these wax figures are just glorified mannequins?  Talk about overhyped.I was really underwhelmed by this place when I came here a few weeks ago with my boyfriend.  I felt like most of the wax figures were obviously not realistic, and in addition the museum was dusty, dingy and dirty!  It's probably because it gets so much foot traffic, but it could definitely use a spring (and fall) cleaning.Also, there was this random "scare factory" type exhibit thing that you walk through, and people jump out at you and scream and randomly bang on things.  They also have wax figures in there, and in the dark you can't tell if its a wax figure or a real person about to scare you.  I don't know if it was a temporary thing for halloween, but it was random as a mofo, I'll tell you that.I wouldn't recommend it unless you're with easily amused (and fooled) small children.
4	So yes, I do all the touristy trap things when I am in Vegas also.. I love it. What else is Vegas for? I can spend 2 days or 2 weeks here and not be bored a bit... So wax people.. sounds maybe not interesting, but it's a blast. Some of them do look real.. scary cause I had a few dreams that were too scary.. ICKAnywhoo... Lovely place to kill some time... its a real art that people don't appreciate.  Way better then House of Wax
4	I had alot of fun at this place and I recommend going there if you are in Las Vegas. I'm a camera w.hore so I had a greatttttt time taking pictures with all the wax figures. I freaked out when I saw the Quantum of Solace exhibit right when I entered. Mmmmm James Bond! Alot of the wax figures look real and it was fun to get up close to them. There was also this haunted trail thing that scared the crap out of us because we thought that was only open during halloween and we were NOT expecting it (we visited during december). Tickets were $25.
5	Ever wanted to say something to I don't know George Bush. Or Brad Pitt for being so damn....awesome? Or Angelina? Yeah Madame tussauds is the place.It's two stories of interactiveness. There is the blue man group. There is hugh hefner. Jenna Jameson. I mean it was insane walking though. For a moment in on room there were so many people. I don't know how to describe it. But it was freaky. But a good freaky. Madame tussauds is great but please bring a camera. For those on a budget there are coupons all over the vegas magazines!Also the scary thing. Geez people. It's fun and it's year round. If you come to this one. Note that there are other Madame Tussauds around the world. I've been to a few of them and none of them are the same. It's a fun way to experience culture.
4	This place is awesome and freaky. Every wax figure looks SO REAL. My peripheral vision was playing tricks on me, I'd see someone out of the corner of my eye and think it was a real person but no, it was Ryan Seacrest or Shaq. Duh! Cool tip here - get your tickets at The Venetian front desk! They will sell them to you for $19 which is less than Madame Toussad's price of $26 (even with their $4 coupon).
4	Smaller than New York's version, but roughly the same price.  Still, the concept of a wax museum filled with celebrities that encourages you to take pictures is too good to avoid.Four stars and a hearty recommendation for this place.  I love it.
4	Kind of pricey, even with a coupon, but totally worth going through at least once. The museum was kind of small, but the fact that it's interactive made it pretty cool. The first exhibit is the Pirates of the Caribbean's Captain Jack Sparrow - he looked so real! I was kind of scared to stand next to him, like he was going to come to life and scare me. Took lots of photos, and some of the statues even look real in the pictures! Great quality of work and lots of variety! I got into bed with Hef, played with the Blue Man Group, got interviewed by Al Roker, stood at the Las Vegas sign with Angelina Jolie, had my husband stand at the alter with Brad Pitt (it was supposed to be George Clooney but they had switched him out for Brad at the time), partied with Elvis and some old presidents.....I was blown away by the quality of the statues and how lifelike they looked. Insane! I highly recommend you bite the bullet on the price and go, at least once. You won't regret it!
4	Interactive wax museum? You bet your sweet ass I'm going to love it! I was here back in November 2008 during my birthday weekend. It cost about $21.95 for adult admission, you get a student discount if you present your student ID.It's fun taking pictures with all the figures and thinking of different poses. My boyfriend thought of all the creative ones! I did agree with one Yelper's comment on the wax figures being  "glorified mannequins", hahah! Some of the figures don't look like the celebs that they are supposed to be. Jennifer Lopez looked more like Kathy Griffin and her ass was reduced by a lot!The best part was the "extra" interactive horror area. Hella scary ass shit but don't be chicken, you must participate!Definitely add this to your agenda if you're visiting Las Vegas.
4	What can I say? I have a thing for seeing wax figures, even if I was traumatized for life by the one in Hollywood at the tender age of 6. Elvira looked dead real! Well, dead alive...wat.On the other hand, Jeff L. is still deadly afraid of wax figurines resembling people he would otherwise gawk at if they were that close in real life. For me, it provides an opportunity to pose in rude ways to people who have more money then me. That or sexy ways, it depends. Michael Jackson still kind of scares me.All of this said and done, a las the pictures of this momentous occasion are no longer with me since my computer got stolen the month before and I didn't back them up. I only have the one of me and Hugh Hefner to prove...nothing.
4	It's definitely a great place to check out. I went here a couple months back with a bunch of friends. We got a kick out of it. We went at night so there wasn't alot of people when we were there. Bring a camera and a whole lotta fun will ensue. The employees didn't mind that we were all messin around everywhere. Guess everyone does it. I would recommend it for anyone that's into taking pictures or loves famous people.
4	Who would've thought I could be easily amused by a bunch of wax statues.  This is a great place to check out when you need a break from the hot weather.  The museum is interactive and you are encouraged to take pictures with all of the wax statues.  A camera is a must as there are a lot of opportunities to take some hilarious pictures.  Price is a little high so be on the lookout for coupons or discounts before going.
4	This place is really fun for people who have always wanted to take wacky photos with their favorite celebrities or just take wacky photos in general.They provide you with props for certain "celebrities" (For exp. I played basketball against "MJ"). This place is good for an overall fun experience. It could have been more wax figures though and some didn't look very realistic. I don't see myself going back in the near future. Once is enough.
4	Had a lot of fun here! Make sure to bring a camera. The statues are so realistic that a lot of people I showed pictures to actually thought I had met those celebrities while I was in vegas!! I have a great pic with me and Jenna Jameson that had everyone at work gawking for an hour! They also had a small haunted house inside (for free) that was a lot of fun. Really enjoyed my stop here!
3	Trust me if you have never been here you should definately check it out, but keep in mind that your first time should be your last time checking it out! I came here couple years ago with a friend of mines and nothing really has changed other than the fact of couple new people and with Shaq in a Phoenix jersey rather than a Miami jersey, thats it! I would only recommend people to check this place out probably once every 5 years or so.
4	Went to Las Vegas on a girls trip. Decided to stop by Madame Tussauds before dinner because we had 2 For 1 coupons. I thought it was going to be a waste of time, but it turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip! We all did the American Idol interactive - and laughed ourselves silly. We have some great photos with Hugh Hefner, George Clooney, and of course Johnny Depp. Do it. It's a blast.You can get the free coupons from http://www.destinationcoupons.com/Nevada/Las_Vegas/Madame-Tussauds/Coupon.htm
4	I had a fun time here.It had been years and years and years since my last trip to a wax museum, so the complimentary tickets we had were very, very worth it.   The line moved rapidly and, in minutes, I was standing next to Indiana Jones.  And Johnny Deppy.  And Brangelina.AND LIBERACE!  Hello... I think I gave this place an extra star just for Liberace!  AWESOME!There was a nice Michael Jackson memorial set up at the entrance, and people had left cards, teddy bears and flowers.  I got to say my goodbyes to Michael, and have the picture to prove it.  I think leaving him teddy bears is a bit dodgy, but hey, who am I to suggest that memorializing him sans kid toys is the way to go?Anyway, the wax figures were fun, some more lifelike than others.  I like all the photo ops that the museum has set up, and the interactive displays.  The scary "Scream" thing did, indeed, make me scream.  And the person behind me grabbed my shoulders so tight that they're still sore.  No, not the actors - much like the sign, they were hands off.It's worth a visit if you have a discount.  The regular price - $25 for adults - felt quite steep to me, and I'm glad I didn't have to pay it.  We were in and out in an hour.Last, we engaged in the "are wax museums cool or are they creepy?" debate.  My conclusion?  Wax museums are creepy cool!
4	I never been to a Wax Museum before my visit here and I gotta admit it was fun and worth it. Even better that every magazine I picked up had a coupon for this place so it was a definite must on the trip. I was also in town when Micheal Jackson passed away so I got to see the MJ tribute display they put outside for everyone.What I really like about this place are those extra props they have with some of the statues, like a golf club with Tiger Woods, the checkered flag with Dale Earnhardt and so on. Also all the crazy pictures you can take with the figures like of coarse standing behind J-Lo and grabbing her ass and watching like 2 or 3 other people behind you do the same thing. For the most part they do a good job on most of the celebs but then you got a couple that look way off like Oprah for example, straight up looked like they punched her face mold in a couple of times before the wax dried off. Only thing I could've done without is that they have some random person there trying to sell you tickets to shows/tours and dinners right near the exit so you gotta put up with that nonsense right before you leave. Other then that though, good times!
5	its true. even in wax form, Salma Hayek, J-Lo, and Marilyn Monroe all give me a BONER.
4	I havent been here in years... nice place to chill for a while and not loose money in the casino (yikes!)I think its kinda small but def. fun!
3	I went here this past weekend with my boyfriend while we were in Vegas. For the most part all the wax statues look like the celebrities themselves. I had to knock of a couple of stars though: One for the almost white looking Beyonce figure, and another for the fact that folks had to pay extra money to take a picture with President Obama's figure. Booo!Anywho, it's a nice attraction to go to in order to get away from all the gambling. We had fun.
4	We were planning our trip to Las Vegas when I ran across the description of Madame Tussauds in Frommers...what sold us was the promise that one could "fondle J.Lo's butt"...yes, that's a direct quote. Not that we would want to do that, mind you, but another friend in our traveling group would.Madame Tussauds didn't disappoint. In a world where production shows confiscate cameras, and an errant shot in a casino can get you ejected, this is one of the few indoor venues in Las Vegas where photography is not just allowed, but downright encouraged. That in itself is worth the rather steep pricetag.All the figures are lifesized and painstakingly measured to look like the celebrity depicted, or at least somewhat like the celebrity. We had a whale of time sizing ourselves up to the celebrities, and getting photo ops that you wouldn't get anywhere else.Sadly, Ms. Lopez' likeness was under repair when we were there, but a rather fair-skinned version of Beyonce stood in for her. My friend was satisfied. :)
5	YAY! I finally came to this place! I've been dying to come here and finally finally I came last week! Its so fun how you can touch the wax figures and take pictures with them! Super fun! This is not your ordinary boring ole wax museum! These are celebrities made out of wax and they look pretty darn real too! The wax museum we have in San Francisco sucks it's really boring and you can't touch the figures and I don't remember if you could take pictures of them. Either way it sucked so 5 stars for madame tussauds!There was this scary thing where you walked through it and people come out and scare you. The man standing in the entrance looked like a wax figure so I was walking up to him to snap a picture and he moved and I of course screamed my head off and ran into the next room. Then the boyfriend forced me to walk through that scary thing with him and 2 other strangers. I swear I almost peed in my pants because one of the people jumped out and started breathing down my neck! ahh! This is a good place to visit in Vegas! Very fun!
5	I finally broke down and had the Madame Tussaud's experience.  It not that I was consciously avoiding it, but the experience never seemed to happen.  Fortunately, with some friends in town, I found my perfect excuse.We got in for a $10 local's price, which is more than worth the price of what you get to see.  The museum is set up really well, with scenarios allowing museum goers to "play" with the wax statues.  They make the posing fun and more interactive.The sculptures themselves are good.  There are others that are so eerily lifelike that you'll feel the need to do a double take.  Jessica Simpson is one.  So is Patrick Stewart.  And Prince.  It's a little disarming, because for the split second you'll see a statue just standing there, and you'll subconsciously register it as another physical presence.  It's a weird feeling, but if you experience it, my description will become more clear.They even have a horror walk room, like those fun houses you experience around Halloween, or when you were a kid.  Why, oh why did my friends declare me group leader?  It's not that I was so much scared, but you're always the first one to get a spooker right in your face, or the one who gets grabbed in fear.  Thanks, guys.  No really.They have an interesting Las Vegas room, full of all the people who have built up the town, and a political figures room.  You can find just about anybody of even remote importance to photograph in here.The disappointment was the gift shop, as nothing really related to the attraction was in there.  The most interest came from me knocking over a tub of high bounce balls, which flew all over the store.  I tried to make light of it as I scooped up a dozen high-flying, glitter filled spheres, telling the sales lady that I just wanted to make her day more exciting.  She looked at me as if I were dead to her.  Sheesh.But it's fun to look and play here, and for the current $10 price (it apparently goes up to $18 for locals after Labor Day, FYI), you more than get your money's worth.
5	I have never been to a wax museum before and I have to say I had a blast. Some of these figures look so much like the real people it's quite scary. Well not really. Go check this place out. It's better than losing money in the casinos.
5	So. Much. Fun.Somehow I've managed to not visit Madame Tussauds on any of my other many trips to Vegas.  I finally popped in last weekend when my boyfriend and I were staying at the Venetian.  It was ridiculously fun.  From Hollywood and Vegas legends to sports heroes to more recent a-list celebs to America's founding fathers, the wax museum has everyone you could want to see cast in wax.  The figures are placed in pretty cool surroundings with enough props and in enough wacky poses to really make them fun.  Bring your camera and get ready to pose for cheesy photos.
5	Again, def. check out the ticket discount booths located throughout the Strip for cheaper tix for this fun place. yes, it is a wax musem filled with all the celebs you can handle. It is interesting to see that a lot of them are either shorter than you thought (Prince, Jessica Simpson, Jodi foster, JLO) or  much taller (all the Bonds). take funny or crazy pictures with Hef, a half nekkid Jenna Jameson, or take dance pictures spanking your ass with beyonce. Lotsa fun. You wont be disappoined.
5	I love this place!  Pretty much my favorite thing to do in Vegas.  Pricewise, you can get $5 off coupons in the books that are free in the cabs or on their website so it's only $20.  The Shaq figure is huge!  It really is an interactive experience...you can get up close and personal with the figures and can touch/grab them all over except for their head/facial region.  My old favorite was the Rock who is now outside and free to pose with.  Not sure who my new fav is....maybe Hef or the fact that you can stick your neck in the tiger's mouth at the Seigfreid and Roy station.  Put aside an hour or two for this place whenever you're in the area and you won't be disappointed.
4	Madame Tussauds is place that is just a place that makes people smile.  It is fun with wax :) We just went the the this past August I had the best time taking pix with the figures and even going through their haunted house (why a haunted house - no idea, but it was fun!). True, some of the figured don't really look like the celebrity (or maybe it is more accurate to say they may have looked like the celeb xx years ago), but you get the point! It is so much fun kissing Johnny Depp or posing with Jackie Kennedy! The price is a bit much ($25/adult), but it is Vegas, it is in line with other places. It was fun and worth the price of admission!  Besides, now I have a pic of Elvis with his hand on my cheek - dreamy!!
5	Fun. Now you can touch the wax figures - so you can get up close and personal and get some great pics. PARKING: Hell. Self park in the Venetian. Up the elevators. Thru the casino/hotel. Outside on the veranda, down the walking escalator and boom - you're there.WALK TIME: 15 mins minimum.The scary zone is cool - very similar to a Universal Studios Halloween Horror maze.
5	This was my second visit to the museum in Las Vegas.  I first got hooked on the works of Madame Tussaud when a friend brought me to the museum in Manhattan.  Initially, it was kind of weird standing next to all the life-size replicas of famous celebrities, sports figures and politicians, but when I finally started noticing the detail that goes into every figure I found the figures much more interesting to admire.It's a fun place to visit and photography is highly encouraged.  For non-camera carrying visitors they have stations set up where their in-house photographers can take a photo of you with adult star Jenna Jameson, a pajama-clad Hugh Hefner or a robust Elvis Presley figure.  For those with cameras you can put on a hat (provided) and pose with the Rat Pack, put on some showgirl's headpiece (also provided) and pose with the Mayor of Las Vegas or grab a paddle (yes, provided) and play alongside the Blue Man Group.  The staff tells visitors it's okay to touch the figures too.  I put my hand up to Britney Spears' face, and yes it was as cold and lifeless as I had imagined.  The hard casted wax feels very much like plastic.This visit found many more figures I had not seen before as well as upgrades of some of the figures I had seen four years ago.  Jennifer Lopez seems to have gotten new hair and the new Madonna figure is a bit more meaty than her previous figures.  I liked the new figures of Beyonce Knowles, Kathy Griffin, Johnny Depp and Spider-Man!  Sadly, the figure of President Barack Obama was removed from the floor for maintenance.There is an optional exhibit inside called Scream with horror figures popping out designed for a sudden scare in a dark setting.  After the first one popped up the rest just seemed kind of quirky.  One lady walking ahead of me kept screaming ... loud.  I just wanted to punch her out.  Glad this little excursion is optional because I found it to be a one time only thing.  The novelty of fright wears off very quickly, and no, I did not punch out the lady.The museum is located to the side of the Venetian Hotel and Casino.  The best time to visit is when you've had too much to eat, seen too many gaming areas or are just tired of looking at merchandise you can't afford.  Madame Tussaud's is a great place to spend two hours.  As with most museums you exit into the gift shop which I found to be the most boring part of this exhibit.I've posted my photos on Flickr:http://www.flickr.com/photos/26-2milesandmore/sets/72157622990409008
3	This was very entertaining. A little be spendy, make sure you troll online, brochures, etc. for coupons!! We were able to score some for $10 off each admission. I like that there are so many different figures and you can touch the figures. A+ for being able to take a picture in bed with Hugh Hefner. I don't think that I would ever need to see this again, but it's a MUST SEE if you have never been!
5	Okay, if you have never been to a max museum, you need to go. I know you think they sound boring or they aren't your thing, I mean it's just a bunch of max sculptures, but bring your camera and some friends and the fun will ensue as you stick your head in a tigers mouth, get married to george clooney and touch j-lo till her cheecks blush. This is one of the best things to do in vegas. It's easy to find, right off the strip. Only downside is that it's the kind of thing you only really need to do once. Although, if you bring a friend who has never been before, the fun starts all over again.
4	I came here once 9 years ago and again this past August and I have to say I do like how they rotate the wax figures in and out. I honestly didn't think a lot of the figures looked like who they were supposed to represent but there were quite a few that were like WOW spot on. My wife took several pictures of me with several female celebrities (Britney, Christina, etc.) and that was very cool. I like how you're allowed to actually touch and interact with them.
4	This is one of the those things you should do at least once in your life time. When I went to Vegas and was not 21 this was soo fun!  I probably wouldn't go now.. but yeah its neat. The wax figures of celebrities from current hot stars to famous political figures you're bound to see someone that tickles your fancy. You'll be able to be interactive with them as much as you like and taking pictures.. I'm sure without being lewd but I don't think they care much. The ticket price is not the cheapest for 25 bucks but you'll probably spend an hour and hey you'll get a lot of fun photos out of it!
4	I've been to the Tussaud's in London, in Hollywood, and love the one in Vegas, although they have many of the same figures in all three (that's the economy of scale you get having multiple locations, I guess).  Fun to take pics of you and the celebrities and get right up and see them up close and personal.
5	Well worth the admission cost $25.00 per Adult, cheaper for Kids and people 65 and older, There is a lot of Different stars something for everyone. Some wax that looks really good! Jenna Jameson, Jennifer Lopez, Brittnay Spears, Jessica Simpson. Then you Have Martin Luther King Jr, Micheal Jordan, President Obama, Tupac Shukar, Snoop Dogg, And who can Forget Elvis! There is also a scream walk through deal that is really fun with Live actors along with other wax figures! Go with a group this is a very fun time!
4	Madam Tussuad's is a must see when you visit Vegas! I had lots of fun "meeting" several of my favorite musicians, actors/actresses, and political figures. They even have props you can use to make the pictures extra special... Cowboy hats off to John Wayne, snuggling next to Hugh Hefner on his famous round bed and a quick "I Do" complete with wedding dress to George Clooney...The only down side is, it took our group 20 minutes to go through the whole museum and we paid 25 dollars... Yes, it's a little spendy, but well worth it.
4	Don't let the word museum scare you away. My husband did not want to do this with me. Towards the end of our trip we started to run out of things to do and this was next door to where we stayed. So we walked on over, turned out being one of the funnest things we did! We laughed A LOT!  We were probably the loudest people in there. So go for it and don't be shy, you'll get better pictures that way. ; )
4	during my recent trip to sin city, i met a ton of celebs.  it was crazy, i felt like i was at the oscars or something.  did i mention they were all made of wax?  oh...well they were, but it was still fun!  i had a bogo coup so we got 2 for 1 which was nice because it is a bit pricey.  this place is awesome, you get to touch and pose with the figures, unlike the now defunct wax museum in buena park, ca, you couldn't get near those figures without a stupid alarm going off.vegas seems to have gotten a bit lame over the years...i used to love it but now it seems as though they are focusing on the wealthy...as i'm not poor, i'm definitely not swimming in my pool filled with hundred dollar bills yet.  so it's nice to find something like madame tussaud's where you can spend a few hours having fun and not paying an arm and a leg.  some of the figures look really authentic, i can't tell you how many times i saw a figure in my peripheral vision and thought it was a real person.  the different rooms are all themed and there is a lot of thought to each celeb.  i also love that you can do whatever you want to the celebs as you take a picture...i flipped off GW bush, laid in a bed with hugh hef, picked a few noses and probably kissed johnny depp. the best was tiger woods in his signature pose...i leaned in front of him so it looked like he was staring at my boobs.  oh silly tiger.i realllllly recommend coming here, you won't regret it.
5	Need some time to kill?? Nah, never in Vegas... if you want to feel like a kid again then go to the Wax Museum.  Just make sure you have someone who is willing enought to snap your picture every 5 seconds.  I assure you that you will take pictures with Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Hugh Hefner, or even Shaquille O'Neal.  I didn't expect to have as much fun as I did at the Wax Museum.  Check it out!!Cheers and Enjoy!
4	I really like this place. I get to tell everyone that I met celebrities and got to take pictures with them. And also I get to have the *&^^%^%$ scared out of me. They have loads of celebrities to take pictures with. You can take as many pictures as you want and you can touch the wax figures lightly. They also have this section called "scream" which interactive. They put you in this dark room and have you go in groups. You have to keep your hands on the other person's shoulder in front of you. And they have actual people come out and scare you. Scary, but fun as well. The only thing I didn't like about this place was that it was a little too short. And it gets crowded sometimes so you have to wait a while before getting to take a picture with the wax figure you want. Overall: I would recommend this place if you want to kill some time and you brought the tickets from Tix4Tonight because then it would be really cheap.
4	This is the second wax museum I've been to and it's definitely the best!!! The fact that it's interactive made it a HUGE plus!!! It's like when they tell you that you can't touch it, you want to even more...well here you CAN!!! I have to say that some of the people didn't look like who they were supposed to be and we definetly had to read the cards next to them to figure it out, but the fact that they have props that you can use while you take pics made up for it! There are different rooms that have different themes and I thought it was well worth the money. If you stay at a hotel and there's a coupon book, look in there cause we got $10 off our ticket prices. SCORE!!! The gift shop at the end was really awesome too. Fun stuff that we didn't see at any other gift shops and as most of us know...it's get pretty repetitive. There's also a walk through "SCREAM" show thing...I would pass that up. It's a lame excuse for an imitation Halloween Horror nights.All in all...go have some fun with some wax figures and tell everyone you're BFF with Justin Timberlake :D
3	Decent way to waste some time other than gambling, drinking, sleeping, eating or shopping.  Dont spend full price though, there are all sorts of discount coupons.
5	Wanna "meet" the stars? Then, I highly suggest heading over to Madame Tussauds in Las Vegas - located at the entrance of the Venetian Hotel, near Sephora. I had been wanting to see the museum since I was just interested in seeing what these wax figure were all about. So, my honey and I need to kill some time on Sunday before our flight and headed over to the museum. The ticket prices are a bit steep - $25 per person, but you get a hefty program and the ability to touch the statues. We headed in and got to take pictures with everyone from Beyonce to Stevie Wonder to the King of Pop. My fave was my honey taking his picture with Stevie Wonder :) Plus, we got a chance to "sit" in the Oval Office and take a pic with the presidente. The only oddest part was this scary exhibit - where zombies try to scare you. It got the blood pumpin, but it was fun. It's a great place to visit and made for lots of laughs! Cheers!
5	Love, Love, Loveee this place..Been to another wax museum and it was nothing compared to this..I had such a blastttt seeing all the wax figurines and taking all types of fun pictures with them.My fav-definitely has to be with Hugh hefner sitting next to him on his bed seriously I loooked like one of his girls. :) The pictures really came out amazing too loved posting them and sharing with friends and some of the pictures were really believable...I loveee how you can actually have some interaction with the wax figurines..got to pose next to Beyonce which totallly did not look like her..got to pretend to be that I was the NEXT American Idol and got to take a picture with the King of Pop Michael Jackson. Tickets were kinda expensive but well worth it..It was a greatttt experience and can't wait to go to another Madame Tussauds..they really did a great job replicating celebs and maxing them really loook like themselves..some were a lil off but most were right on the money. I think everyone should check this place out at least once! :)
4	my party had a blast!  you can actually walk up to each "person" -- touch them, take pictures -- basically -- do whatever!  fun!  you end up in a gift shop in the end, but that is typical of museums.   my dad said it was the best thing about the trip to Vegas -- and considering the day before we visited the Grand Canyon -- that was odd -- but oh well.  Like I said, the place was a blast.  The price is like $25 per adult.  Not bad I guess.
4	I went with my mom and I thought it was going to be a snooze, but then we started striking doofy poses with the wax figures and suddenly I was in bed with Hef and having SO MUCH FUN.Be on American Idol! Pose with Elvis! Sit on Evel Knievel's bike! Pose with Obama and MARRY GEORGE CLOONEY. We did it all and had a blast. Put fresh batteries in your camera first! All the cabs around Vegas have booklets with coupons for tickets here, so make sure to snag one.
2	I went only once several yrs ago when I was in Vegas just for the day & for the money, it wasn't that big, so I got through it pretty quickly.  When it was over, I said, "Is that it?"  I'm sure they change their exhibits, I'm just not sure if I want to spend that kind of money to go there again.
4	I've always wanted to go to a Madame Tussauds museum and now that I have, I can cross that off my bucket list!It was a great experience.  Try not to power through the whole thing, just take it slow and browse everything.  And here's a money saving tip: sign up for Venetian's Grazie (players club) card and you can get $8 off each adult admission.
4	Located at the Venetian hotel, this is a place to have some fun. There's Wax figures of a lot of celebrities including, Johnny Depp, Andre Agassi, Chris Angel, and more... You can have a picture marrying George Cloony or sharing a bed with Hugh Hefner. The sillier you act the better the pictures and the time you'll have. They also have a little haunted maze/ area - you'll scream and laugh at the same time. Almost at the end of the museum you get the chance to have a picture with President Obama... This was my second time at the museum (first time was 5 years ago) and was happy to see some new figures. Make sure to bring your student ID if you have one, discount if you show it when going in.
5	This was my first visit to a wax museum.  I was impressed with it all and it was well worth the $20.I thought it was well organized and the figures are very high quality.  I enjoyed the snoop dog throne, the mick jagger display, and the Obama display.This place is a gem.
4	First thing to do is buy tickets on line when coming here, because you can get 25% off which isn't too shabby when it normally costs $25.  Next thing to do is bring a camera with an extra set of batteries because if you do it right, you should be shooting shots like crazy with all the fun you can have here.There's a whole host of celebrities that I won't get into since my fellow Yelpers did that nicely.  But what I will say is that they allow you to interact with the wax figures so you can really have fun getting a photo of yourself or whomever you are with by posing pretty freely.  This is the only wax museum that I know that allows this so that alone makes it great.   It's a good idea to take your time here so you don't pout later when you didn't get that special shot of sitting with Heff or standing by Jolie that you wanted and missed out on.    Scream area's pretty cool and the gift shop has some nice knick knacks too.
5	This place is AWESOME! I had the best time in here.  Normally wax museums freak me out but this one I loved and can't wait to go back.  I loved the fact that we could take pictures in there.  We were acting like a bunch of goof balls in there.  I also liked the fact that at the end they asked if they wanted us to take our picture with Obama.  I said sure so they took my picture, then they asked if they would like to take one with my camera in case I didn't want to buy theirs.  They were super friendly.  There is a Haunted House in there but you can bypass it.  If you don't want to go in run fast like I did because they will jump out and scare you lol.
4	The best Non-drinking thing to do in Vegas and it is interactive. The place is located next to The Venetian and it was Super fun!! The Hotel/Timeshare gave us some vouchers, and we decided to check it out. The Cashier did not even charge us for the 5th person we had, so Kudos to her. We had been to the one in Fisherman's Wharf, but this one was completely different. You can take pictures with these Wax Statues, and also interact with the environments. For instance, I posed with T-Woods, and also was able to actively practice my putting skills on the "Green:. Another fun thing that you can do is pick a paddle, and pose with the "Blue Man Group",  (Too bad they did not have any more Blue paint) Lots of Celebrities like Wolfgang Puck, Hugh Hefner, B- Spears, and the Rat Pack to name a few. The only thing I did not do was the "Horror" Fright room. I guess it is some interactive room where you see the Scarier figures. No one was manning the line at the time. Overall, a fun experience and definitely a must see when in Vegas.
4	Life-sized celebs made of wax?  Yes please!  I've been here twice and I loved it both times!  It's definitely worth the $20-$25 admission, and it's a great daytime activity to do in Vegas to kill time before the real partying begins when the sun goes down. :)If you've learned from my previous reviews, I looooove scary and haunted things!  Madam Tussauds has a haunted surprise towards the end of the tour.  SO FUN.  It's a short haunted walk in the dark, and actors jump out and attempt to scare the pants off you...and they usually succeed!  I always leave the haunted house in tears of fear and laughter.
3	4 stars seems too generous for what you pay and 5 stars...that's crazy talk.When we first approached the entrance and asked the fee we were told $25 a person. Wh...what?! To see fake people? No thank you. I told the friendly staff person that $25 was a bit high and she instantly came down to $35 for 2 people. $17.50 is still high but a much better deal than $25/person.The actual wax museum was cool. There were a lot of "stars," many of which were waxed in their younger, better looking years (cough, cough, Oprah).It felt short and worked itself into the inevitable sinkhole of a tourist trap with gift shop and photo opportunities and all (with President Obama).All in all, it was ok. Not great, not poor but ok. Would I go back to it next time? Err, no. Was I glad I checked it out for an ok cost? You bet.
4	If your planning on visiting Vegas, it would be a shame to past this up. This was my first visit to a wax museum and I was thoroughly impressed. Me and my hubby had a great time. (check out the pics, I think he had a better time than I did) We had a great time taking pictures and clowning around. I see that some are upset about the $25 price for the entry fee. We picked up one of those Vegas books. They showcase food, shows and entertainment. Inside of the gems are coupons to the local events. We got a coupon out of there for $5 off each admission price.It took us a little over an hour to go through the entire museum. We didn't go into the horror show.(I'm a scary cat) It was great fun.  I personally think that the adults have more fun than the kids do.
4	Wow I really had a better time than I thought when I visited the museum. I went in not very optimistic, come on really wax museum I was not all that excited. I was pleased with the $20 worth of entertainment I received. Regular admission is $25, but you can find a coupon in several of the coupon books located around the strip. I don't know if it was the few drinks I had before visiting but I had a blast. It was exciting deciding on what pose I wanted to make with each celebrity. I love Snoop and Obama they were awesome. I don't think it is a place that I would visit often unless they update the displays.
4	Honestly, I was willing to pass Madame Tussauds because of the high admission prices.  However, SOMEHOW, we ended up with discounted coupons and the four of us were able to go.It was very impressive, seeing all these wax models of celebrities.  I did not, however, go through the haunted scary mansion.  That's not me, sorry.My sister's boyfriend participated in the American Idol part of the museum.  They recorded his 'audition' of "Let's Get It On" and the judge, Simon shared his two cents.We took a picture with Obama and made a $15 purchase of the photo.  It was a bit pricey... but then again, its vacation, so what the heck.
5	Awesome. I'd say its worth the money for 30 min of entertainment. Even better with a coupon out of mostly any entertainment guide along the strip.
4	interesting  in that you can take photos of your self with the  wax figures some  figures were spot on and some had me guessing ....a cool ( really ! ) spot  on a hot summer  day in august i wet my pants  in the scary part  LOL
4	Madam Tussauds was a must for me and my crew on our Vegas trip. When will you ever get a chance to take a picture copping a feel on Jessica Simpson (my male friend's single goal for the visit) or sitting on the heart shaped bed with Hugh Hefner wearing bunny ears? I love how up close and personal you can get. I thought it was weird they put a mirror behind Snoop Dogg. He's one of my all time favorite artists and all my picture in the throne had flash back. I did love the Elvis that sings to you, posing with Sigfeid and Roy, and pinching Criss Angel's nipple (my favorite picture). I thought it was weird some of the people that they chose to portray, because it wasn't very large. I thought it was kind of strange that they had JFK and Jackie O, or western stars that have been out of the main stream for a long time. Its a must for all groups visiting Las Vegas looking for hilarious and memorable pictures. The bigger your sense of humor, the more fun you will have.
4	Totally worth checking out, the ticket is 25 bucks but you can talk yourself into a $10 off coupon if you work the people at the counter. Some of the figures are better than others, but it's all very well done and entertaining. They encourage you to touch and pose with the figures. It's a lot of fun if you are with a couple people and have a camera!!
4	This was my first wax museum experience and I really enjoyed it. I was buzzin and had fun taking pics with the celebs haha....the only one that I couldn't figure out who it was and had to look at the sign was Ben Affleck...didnt get that one at all. My favorite was Prince cuz i'm a huge Chappelle's Show fan. if you are as well you're laughing right now. check it out...but get tickets through tix 4 tonight...i paid $34 tax, fees, and all for 2 tickets.
4	This place is tons-o-fun. It also helps with relationships. My bf took a picture with G.W. Bush and I with Obama....well, well, at least we know where our political affiliations stand!This place is great and the life-like celebrity statues are great! I really enjoyed this place and got some great photos our of it, I highly recommend this place to people. Also, if you want to save a buck, there is always a coupon in one of those Las Vegas guide books for $12 off! Sweet!
5	This place was so fun!  There were so many famous faces everywhere!  I didn't expect to see so many celebrities or expect the place to be as big as it was.  The rooms are separated by musicians, athletes, actors, presidents and other miscellaneous people standing around.  There was no wait to get in at 6pm on a sunday evening.  It was not crowded and everyone inside had a chance to take pictures with whomever they wanted.  There was a interactive Scream! show that had famous villains like Michael Meyers and Freddie Krueger inside but I was too chicken to go in!  Overall, very fun place, don't forget your camera!
4	As other folks have noticed, you can totally find 5-10 dollar off coupons within a short distance, or get in free by seeing Blue Man Group. It's cheesy but it's fun and there's a good mix of current pop culture and older classics as well as historical figures. In short, there's somebody for everybody. While it's not very large, they really do make decent use of the space. (Well, all but the silly and not-very good Halloween attraction. Sigh. Wish we'd skipped that.) The quality of the figures is generally pretty good, although a handful of them veer into the deeper parts of the Uncanny Valley and a few don't really look like their person. (The Harrison Ford doesn't really look that much like him, and I'd only have known because of the Indy outfit.) Some are so good, that you see them out of the corner of your eye and think they are other people standing around looking at the exhibit. The layout is such that very few are on pedestals or sequestered off to the side, and most of them are free-standing in such a way that encourages pictures. When we went on the wedding trip, it wasn't very crowded and the only person there was really a line for was Barack Obama. The Husband said it was more crowded in August though.
4	This place is 100%, hands down, a tourist trap, AND I DON'T CARE.Judge me all you want you judgy judgersons.I made friends Jen F. and Mike C. come along for the fun and we posed with all of the wax figurines with the best of them.If you get creative and have some fun and don't worry about people judging you for hitting up the wax museum, you will really have a good time here.Some of the figurines are such dead ringers that it is totally creeper. Some of them totally miss the mark.The Fear Zone, or haunted thingy, whatever it is...was totally lame, but they certainly get you all revved up for the scare of your life. It's too funny!So go ahead, put your face in Jenna Jameson's crotch, punch Al Roker in the junk, put your lady giblets in Tiger's hooker eating-out face, make Snoop Dawg grab your titties. THIS IS VEGAS, why be PG with the wax figurines?
4	Touristy? Yes, but such a fun place to go with friends or family. It's fun for everyone because they have wax figures of all sorts (pop culture, sports, political, etc.). Some of them really look good, others don't but it's funny. The best way to have fun is to take your camera and take silly pictures with all the wax figures. Oh and it's really easy to get the $10 off coupon in those vegas booklets you see everywhere at all the hotels. Just browse through and you'll find it. Definitely worth the time with the coupon.
3	Great place to take goofy pictures. Some of the people did not look like the real deal, but overall I would recommend. You need to set aside at least 1 1/2 hours to go through the place. It's pretty big. Prices are cool if you either live here or can get a military discount, as it is a little pricey.
4	Get ready for a hallarious good time.Can you pose with Stevie Wonder at a piano with your own sunglasses on and make a fool of yourself, capturing the moment for a life time?  Hell Yes!!  And I have proof!Everyone from Heff to Julia Robert's to your favorite sports stars that I don't know and/or care about are here and it's a lot of fun to pose with your favorites and people watch of others making similar fools of themselves.Pressed penny machine a definite plus!!
4	I've always been a fan of the wax museum but this one is great fun.  When we arrived one of the attendants told us we were free to take as many pictures and touch any of the figures we wanted.  We had great fun shooting hoops with Shaq and playing golf with Tiger Woods.  Very much fun, all the interactive exhibits.They moved them around a bit from last year and added and subtracted some put it was much fun.  This year we skipped the scary part.  It was fun the first time but I figured I would give it a break this year.  Without being a spoiler, it will make you scream.  I really enjoy the fact that you are given free reign in the place.  You can even sing like an American Idol if you choose.  There are  people from the days of old and current stars.  The most recent one I noted this trip was Robert  Pattinson from the Twilight series there were many fans around him both teenage and older.  I didn't see Taylor Lautner, what about the fans of Team Jacob?  Well, ce la vie.You can get coupons at the visitor's center near the convention center.  We received $7 off per ticket.  It's about $25 regular price to get in.  So, definitely worth it to get the coupons.  Also, if you participate in the Gondola ride there are $5 off coupons on the back of your receipts so keep them for now or later.Good times.  I'll go back again.
5	I am pretty sure that this is where I took 95% of my pictures in Vegas. It was truly, epically fun. I am one of those people whose sense of humor most certainly includes taking silly pictures with things, and an interactive wax museum is right up my alley. I didn't expect to learn anything there, but I so seriously did. (For example, did you know that George Washington was *huge*? I didn't, but he seriously is, especially for his day and age. Neat, huh? )The horror section "Scream" was remarkably fun, I would certainly not recommend skipping it. There were zombies and all the standard scary things, but it was done in a truly fun way. It is also a cool fact that this is one of the few generally wholesome, family friendly places in Vegas, if that helps you at all...The faces were generally pretty spot on, I assume the bodies were too, and the costumes and props/interactive pieces were amazing. They even left a hat and a mic for you to sing with the Rat Pack. I would recommend it. So yes... give it a try if you have an hour to spare, you won't regret it.
3	I was pleasantly surprised.  In general, I have no interest in gawking at live celebrities, so the idea of spending time and money wandering around with wax impersonations of celebrities didn't appeal to me.  With a discount coupon I was coaxed into a wander through.The sculptures are remarkably realistic, that is no surprise though.  What did surprise me was that you're allowed to touch!  I agree with the other reviews - this is a place where if you're the type that can use a little imagination and have fun acting like goofballs and posing in silly (scandalous) positions with recognizable faces (and bodies) you'll have a ball.  It's a great place for people watching, you can feed off the excitement of other groups.All in all there are still many other places I'd rather be, it's just not my thing.  But, if you're so inclined, you can let loose and make this destination a winner.
3	Great figures, love the props for interacting. However, the smallest Tussauds I've been to with a price so high. Thank goodness for coupons!
3	On our last day in Vegas we had time to kill before heading to the airport so we made a stop here. It was kinda fun and creepy at the same time. Why? Seeing all them celebrity wax figures was cool and informative. I mean these are exact replicas to the celebrity which means everything is the exact proportions. I always thought George Clooney and George W Bush were taller but they are not....look taller on TV. Anyways, the creepy part is I always felt like someone was watching me...it can make you uneasy fer sure.For the most part I enjoyed myself. How could you not when your hanging with Elvis/Sinatra and the Godfather all at the same time.
2	This is pretty boring. Some wax figures are spot on, while others are OK or needed improvement. We walked through the whole thing in 20 minutes and really couldn't wait to get finished with it. We stopped to take pictures and tried to enjoy it, but there are better things to do in Vegas. I'd rather go watch the Bellagio Fountains again.
4	A great wax museum. One of the few places I was allowed to get close to the figures, only to be scared one might be playing a prank on you and then jump out at you...This place has a great presentation. The selection seemed smaller than the other wax museums and didn't have any wax museum staples, like Charlie Chaplin. What's a wax museum without Charlie Chaplin?
3	I had always passed this place and wanted to check it out.  And finally I did.  I got a AAA discount so I saved like $3.00 a ticket but I think I could have gotten cheaper tickets if I had found a coupon.What I like about this Wax Museum is that they let you get up close and personal with the figures...that being said you don't really want to get TOO close to the figures...can you imagine how many germs are on them...yikes!It was a good size museum but they didn't have a lot of really interesting figures...especially for a place like Las Vegas.  I think this is more like a one time deal...I can't imagine that I would be back anytime soon.  Still it was a good way to spend an hour or so and I got quite a lot of photos...so it was all good!
4	* If you are students, make sure bring your students IDs for cheaper tickets than the general admission. If you came with group of people, only one student ID will work and all of you will get the discounts.* I got my picture taken next to my Mother Monster (Lady Gaga) which was pretty amazing.* I was in bed with Hugh Hefner with my girlfriends as well.* Dwayne THE ROCK Johnson didn't get intimidate by me.* I was the adopted daughter of JFK and Jackie O. I had so much fun at this museum. One of must see attraction in Vegas. Who knows that I actually love wax museum?
4	A camera + a little creativity + a sense of humor = a good time at Madame Tussaud's.   I was surprised that they have everything so open and you can actually touch the figures.  We had a blast!
4	Haha... I saw a creative side of my boyfriend that I have not seen before. Usually he doesn't like smiling or posing for pictures... but he did at this place.  We had more pictures of him than me for once!  At first, I kept thinking there was people standing next to me or staring at me... but it was just the wax figures.  It was a nice experience.  The scream part of the place was not that scary but kind of gross.  The actors kept breathing on me.  We we lucky to have a Groupon for this place.  Saved us money!
5	My sister-in-law went a little crazy in here and had some hilarious poses with some of these " wax celebrities." This place was nice, We had some good times, took some funny pictures, posed with Hugh Hefner and tiger woods, and Bon Jovi (just for grandma), and had some good laughs afterwards. Theres a haunted-house sort of thing there towards the end, and of course, we all did it. Except our lil sis whose only 5, she got freaked out by the scary looking door-man that i thought was a wax figure at first as well, till i got closer and he screamed and scared the living crap out of me, haha but nonetheless, We enjoyed every minute of it.
4	This is the kind of place that you can come to once and have a blast, but you can pretty much never come again, not without at least a ten year gap that is, unless you want to see the same figures all over again. They still have Buffy the Vampire Slayer lol, when was the last time she was even in a movie anyways? I'm sure she has her fans, though! So anyway, I went for my "one time" and yup! it was definitely entertaining. It's pricey, yes. I recommend going over to one of the various Tix4Tonite or Half Price Tix booths and buy your tickets there at a discounted rate. We didnt follow my own advice because it took us a few tries just to find the place so by the time we got there we were just like "yuuuhhh whatever we'll pay the price already!" So, that leads me to my next point! For whatever reason I assumed we had to go all the way through the huge hotel (the Venetian) to find this place, but in actuality it's very easily accessible from the street. It's right next to the Sephora which is clearly visible from the street. From there, there are a few moving walkways you take which will lead you right up to Madame Tussauds! aka Where You Wanna Be! Some figures looked more realistic than others, but it was all fun to see anyway. I wish they would do something to make them less shiny, since that's pretty much the only thing keeping me from believing some of them actually were real! If you have a good camera I would recommend lowering the mega pixels to make the figures look more realistic on film! Some of the figures are placed sort of awkwardly just smack dab in the middle of the room and its kind of freaky because it looks like they're just staring at you. There are others where you can full on interact with the figures though which are awesome and fun to play around with. Don't be embarrassed to make playful poses because everyone does it! Let loose and have fun!
4	We really enjoyed ourselves at Madame Tussauds.  We got a discount from the facebook page.  But when we finally looked through a Las Vegas coupon book there was a BOGO coupon!  Anyway, we were very pleased with the whole museum. There were some figures that looked so real I actually said, "excuse me" as I bumped into them!  It was pretty busy on some floors but we did see each figure.We did go to Madame Tussauds in 2003 as well and many of the figures were the same, but there were tons of new ones as well.
3	This was fun, to see life size versions of "influential" people. I'm pretty cheap, and I actually feel like I get my money's worth going here. Very interesting.
5	Best. Wax. Museum. So far.I went with family.  The wax figures are amazing.  They look so real, I was getting freaked out about them staring at me.  I was there a few years ago and liked it even better this time.  If you're like me and don't gamble, this is a fun afternoon activity if the weather is crap.
4	This is my first wax museum. I've always wanted to go to one so my bf took me to one in vegas!I went in the afternoon in March. It wasn't too crowded so I was able to take plenty of pictures with the wax figures! It was much bigger than I thought it would be! Some of the figures were amazing and fun to take pictures with! It was nice adventure to get away from the strip (kind of!) Also, you can still drink inside and there's AC!Granted I was pretty buzzed when I went on the "scream" experience. My bf told me the experience scared the shit out of him when he was younger. In quite honesty, I'm get pretty scared easily. Anyway, it's a line where you have to put your hands on each other's shoulders. And it's pitch black inside and random psychotic crazy people dressed in costumes try to scared the crap out of me. Yeah, it scared the shit out of me. So make sure you get a little buzz going on before entering the scream experience! The price isn't too bad if you can get a discount or buy somewhere else for cheaper!I was definitely not disappointed. If you ever wanted to take a break from drinking/gambling, you should come by the wax museum!
4	It was a good experience, but not worth the price (I found the $10 off coupon about 10 minutes AFTER I went...figures).  So it was fun, but not worth $25.They have really realistic figures, though!  I liked how I could put on the Playboy bunny ears and pour Hef a glass of champagne.  That was really cute.  There were props throughout the museum (like where Tiger Woods was, you could pretend to golf with him...not that you would want to...lol)They also had this random haunted house in the middle of the museum before the room where Elvis was.  It seemed really out of place for May when we went, but it was fun nonetheless.  Especially since you couldn't tell what was a wax figure and what was real!Overall, it was a fun time, but I wish I had seen the coupon ahead of time!  It would have made my wallet much happier!
1	skip this expensive place. They all look real, and they are freaky that way, but most of them don't even look like the person.  It is hit or miss.  Plus they are so limited.  Some old Vegas oldies, a few new rappers, mostly boring and I had wished I used the money at the slots.
4	always love coming to this place. this year i did the scream machine and oh boy glad i came out without a pee spot on my pants.. talk about scary.
4	I really love our Las Vegas MT over the one in Hollywood! This place is amazing! Jam packed with stars it just kept going and going and going. The haunted house was freaky, I think I will pass that up next time. I almost pissed my pantaloons, I was actually scared when this dude/monster came at me from behind banging the walls so hard and loud with this medieval looking plank with a ball chain and spikes, ugh. He got so close I thought he was really going to kill me!!!!! Ok they got me scared! lolWhen I went they had recently added Tiger Woods, they have him kneeling as if he is trying to eye up his next golf shot. A bunch of teen boys had way too much fun snapping pics standing in front of his face, eh hem. lol Funny stuff. Don't forget your camera, tons of photo ops!I attached a few pictures, they even have snoop dog and billy idol! Yay I want more more more...more more more. lol
4	This place is pretty fun - wax of celebrities, taking pictures next to them is  cooliosus  experience.  I enjoyed it so much the first time that I had to take my BF to experience it.  I suggestion not to go here more than once.  It's fun the first time, but not any different the second time around. Some wax are moved around here and there, some are added but for the most part it's the same.  Tip:I believe there's a group discount, so if you're going in a big group ask about it, they even do student discount =)
4	This was one of the things I really wanted to do in Vegas and I am glad we were able to. The Wax models were so life like that at times it was down right freaky. My hubby and I had a blast posing with the figures and taking silly pictures. It was not pricey to enter and I highly recommend getting the program for only $5. They take pictures before the Scream attraction and with Obama and you can buy them if you wish. The prices again are reasonable and if yours look good then I say buy them as something to remember your trip by.
4	Always a great time.  Stars always changing!
4	I've always wanted to go to a Madam Tussauds since I first learned of them. When we decided to go to Vegas for our vacation and this was one of the tickets we could get through our package deal, I jumped on it. It's well worth the price of admission. We had a lot of fun posing with the different statues. My wife pretended to be a Bond girl as she was trying to decide who she liked better, Sean Connery or Daniel Craig. Me being the history buff that I am was able to pose between Ben Franklin and George Washington. The funniest moment was when we were walking through, there was a line for photos with Sean and Daniel and I thought this guy was waiting in line so I stood next to him waiting. Turns out I was standing next to Larry King... he was so lifelike! They also have a dark house section done on an Area 51 theme. We went through with a couple of ladies that happened to show up the same time I did. Since I was the only guy, I took the lead. Probably would have been better if I had been in the back because the workers scared the snot out of the women with us in the back. It was fun, we laughed. We really had fun. Definitely worth the price of admission.
4	At long last I experienced Madame Tussauds Las Vegas.  It took a Groupon that was nearing its expiration date and a visit from my mother to get me there after passing numerous times by the front of the exhibit on the walkway leading to the Venetian.  Once inside, I was struck by the size of the place, the number and variety of wax exhibits, the obvious effort and funds expended to create suitable and novel backdrops for various wax tributes to instantly recognizable celebrities, and, above all, how lifelike most of the wax models seemed--especially the eyes, which were glassy and contained almost a spark of life, and the contours of women's legs.  The eyes of the waxy Cameron Diaz looked identical to the eyes of the real Cameron Diaz.  And, the legs on the wax model of Jessica Simpson looked just like the legs of Jessica Simpson in the flesh, while the legs and thighs of Beyonce the waxed figure reflected real simultaneous power and grace of the person she was modeled after.  Also, I noted that the stature of most actors and politicians was well over six feet in height.I enjoyed meeting John Wayne and John Kennedy face to face, and to become reacquainted with celebrities that I had actually talked with when they were alive in both body and spirit: Louis Armstrong and Paul Newman; and Elvis Presley, whom I had once seen perform live at the Orange Show in San Bernardino, California, not long before a crashing private plane so damaged that building that this entertainment venue was never replaced.  There were a few surprises (Bette Midler and Prince are apparently much shorter than I thought, and Jimi Hendrix was much taller), and a few misses (I didn't think the George Clooney model liked like the real George Clooney).All in all, it was a very good day, and what I considered a cool experience.  The attractions seem to appeal to all ages.  My mother and wife also enjoyed the experience, and persons of all ages were seen happily hugging a celebrity and aping for a photograph with their favorite likeness.  I, too, got into this spirit--sharing the spotlight with several celebrities: Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and of course Lady Gaga, among others.  And, I made a new food find at the snack bar inside:  Popcornopolis Zebra Chocolate Popcorn.  This delicious flavored popcorn contained hard alternating swirls of both Dark Chocolate and White Chocolate that melted in the mouth.
3	Pretty good selection of current wax characters.  About 50% look really good.  25% are ok and the rest you need to guess who they are.  It's really good they let you touch and photograph with the figures.  They have a good discount on their website.  A little better can be found at the 1/2 price locations around town.  On the down side, the figures are getting a bit worn and for the price, there should be a bit more of them and a live narration or brief intro would have been great.  They have a scream zone, which is a bit lame.  I thought it would be a bunch of figures where some were real and some weren't, but it was just a bunch of dark corridors with people hiding and jumping out at you.
4	I had a deeply discounted coupon that I took advantage of today.  I was to Madame Tussaud's last year.  The place hasn't changed a whole lot but the Scream area was open today.  It was closed when I was here before.For the most part, the wax figures are well done.  I probably spent more time here last year because I was with a friend and we took a lot of photos and enjoyed everything.  Today, I simply walked through - looking for any changes - and I people watched - one of the best things about Las Vegas.  You tourists sure are funny!
3	My wife dragged me here unwillingly after the poor experience that we had with wax museums in Branson. Well, this one was much better. It was fairly expensive, but there are coupons out there for it, which cuts the cost by about 20%... still kinda expensive for how short the attraction is. The wax figures were done very well, and I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. The biggest problem that I had with Madame Tussauds is the length. For the price, you aren't getting a whole lot. If they're charging $25 per person, it should be expanded by at least 50%. On the positive side, the layout of their exhibits worked really well. Overall, it was fun, and it was worth going to see once.
4	Got to be "tourist" and enjoyed 1/2 price tickets.  Most the displays were very intersting but Bruce Springsteen?  Not even close!No matter, great place to get photos with Obama, Bush or even Abraham Lincoln!Skip the scary part of the tour.  I was figuring it to be a few more wax sculptures to view like dracula or frankenstein.  Instead, its a cheesy haunted house where you walk a maze and people jump out and scare you.  Nice try.
4	Yelp 365 challenge: Review 008/365 (8/8/2011)This is my second time checking out the LV location of Madame Tussaud's.  My first experience was six years ago, but I do recall a lot of the exhibits from back then.  A few of the noteables include:  Brad Pitt, Hugh Hefner, Prince, Tiger Woods, Muhammed Ali, Jennifer Lopez, George Clooney, Madonna and, of course, Elvis.  I do know that Lady Gaga is a new addition and that figures like Selena Gomez and Barack Obama only came around a few years ago at most, but I'm not sure about whether a few others (such as Beyonce, Simon Cowell, Justin Timberlake and Snoop Dog) were there all this time or not.  I'm also not sure whether installment dates are noted next to each statue - if not, this would be a useful feature to have.During this second visit, it was pretty crowded and therefore most of our time was spent waiting for those ahead of us to take pictures.  I really think that MTWM should implement a "crowd control" feature, in which only a certain number of people gain admission at any given time.  This would allow visitors like me the ability to lessen the discrepancy between time spent waiting around, and time spent actually enjoying the exhibits.  Maybe this is already happening, but if so, it wasn't obvious to me.We also went into the haunted house portion of the museum, which I had already tried out during my first visit.  If my memory serves me correct, I could've sworn that there were more "spooks" back then (e.g., people unexpectedly jumping out in front of us).  Also, my friend who was leading the line said it was a bit too dark to see where he was going.  I thought so too, but - unlike me - he has perfect eyesight and good night vision.  Perhaps the haunted house was short-staffed (or maybe they've downsized staff) on this second visit though, so I'm not knocking off any stars for this factor.I'm still undecided as to whether the $20 I spent for admission was worth it or not.  Regular price is $25 per adult, but we were able to find a $5 off coupon (you don't have to look too far for free tourist books, as they are readily available in most hotels / along most sidewalks).  I suppose it was worth it for my friend, since he's never been here before, so at least one of us got their money's worth.At the end of the museum, there is a gift shop.  At this point, you can check out the pictures taken of you at:  (1) the start, with the big dice; (2) the entry to the haunted house, in a mid-scream pose; and/or (3) the end, next to President Obama.  Staff doesn't pressure you to buy copies of these pictures, a gesture I appreciate since they are an unnecessary rip-off IMHO (the photographers are always willing to take the same pictures with your camera prior to using their own equipment).  Otherwise, I'm a bit confused about what's available at the gift shop.  Most of the merchandise, albeit funny in a racy and/or sarcastic way, have nothing to do with MTWM or even Las Vegas.  Fortunately, there's a pressed penny machine (the kind that elongates pennies and inscribes them with a logo / picture) located right outside.  The pennies cost $0.51 each and have a variety of designs to choose from.All in all, MTWM was OK but not the most memorable part of my trip.  I think I'll go back only in another six years LOL.  Four stars.
4	This is a fun attraction in Las Vegas. It's located on the Las Vegas Strip just outside the Venetain. I think it's great because you can get up close and personal with the figures. You can take all the photos you want. They have staff who are stationed at specific places taking photos which you can purchase at the end of the tour but they don't push you to do it and they will take the photo with your camera as well. The tour is self guided which is fun because you might want to spend more time in one room over another. They have two floors with a lot of interactive stuff including a Scream scary attraction inside. Overall, I think it's worth the money and it is one of the few things you can do here in Vegas with your entire family.
4	I had a lot of fun here and completely enjoyed the trip with my partner.We were both making weird poses and faces with our wax celebrities. Buy the powerpass! Get all your attractions for a much lower price, but you are going to have to fast pace yourself since they run by daily rates!
5	We LOVED our stop here! This place also has coupons and student discounts, so it was one of the cheapest spots for us to visit while in Vegas. Some of the wax figures are more life-like than others, but we still had fun taking ridiculous pictures with all of them. There are staff posed at popular figures (Jack Sparrow, Obama) to take pictures, but they all offered to take the picture on our cameras. They were all very friendly and helpful. There was a haunted house type walk through in the middle of the museum that was fun, too. They had a great selection of wax figures, but I don't think kids would know who most of them are and they would probably get bored after awhile.This was a great place to visit, and most of my vacation pictures were from here.
4	Pretty decent. Not a lot of people in there so you have tons of time to pose and act of fool. Little damage to the wax figures; however, some were missing fingers and such. Overall, pretty good. They change the outfits and have new figures. We went to the one in NY prior to this and the ones they didn't have in NY (e.g., MJ) were at Las Vegas.Worth the money as you'll get some laughs, if you don't hold back.
3	It was definitely cool. I like wax museums. Especially where you can pose with them. I don't know if I feel like it was worth what I paid though.
5	I am a huge fan of wax museums! I LOVED THIS PLACE! We paid $15.00 to get in and it was EEEEEPPPPPPPIIIIIICCCC!!!! I loved taking stupid photos. Here you can grab the asses of such celebrities as, J'Lo, Jessica Simpson, Beyonce, Brittany Spears, Jenna Jameson (Better wash after that one) and Sarah Michelle Gellar, Best part is, you WON'T get slapped! EEEEEE!!!!!! But seriously, Take your kids. You'll love it! Take naughty pictures and have a blast!
1	The Scare for Halloween at Madam Tussauds was sucktastic.  It was simply and undeniably stupid.  Thank goodness everyone in my group of 6 had Groupon passes.  5 people wandering by in the dark yelling and banging on the plywood walls was just irritating, not scary. Oh, and all the wax figures?  Forget it....it's DARK, you can't see anything.  When there is a tiny bit of ambient light, the figures in those locations are, natch, covered in sheets.  Go watch drunks on the strip...that's free and far more entertaining than this dreck.
4	Definitely entertaining! Madame Tussauds is a damn good time! There is a plethora of amazingly well done wax figures. Even though a few figures don't look like the real counterpart, most look freakishly real and I love how you can interact with them. You can curl up with Hefner, dunk with Shaq, and join Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra on stage. They also have cool props to use like bunny ears for Hefner and pirate gear for Jack Sparrow aka Johnny Depp . :D Bring your camera, and have plenty of memory space! All in all, MT is fun and well worth the coupon price :) . You can find coupons just about anywhere. My bf managed to snag discounted tickets on groupon .com -regular $25.
4	It's just amazing what they can do with wax.  This was the first place we visited in Vegas.  We paid $25 a person.  The entire time we were in Madame Tussauds I kept thinking are these wax figures like Barbie and Ken or are they anatomically correct down there. The wax figures looked so real it made me feel strange just walking up to them and taking pictures without their permission.
4	If you like feeling the breasts of Jenna Jamison, Halle Berry or Brittney Spears without being sued or slapped in the face, this is the place to go to. The price to get in is like $25 bucks if memory serves me right. But GF and I got our tickets at the half ticket kiosks that you see in about every corner of the street. We paid $17 and they didn't expire until the following week.I would rate it a 5 star but the hunted house thing they had there was about as bad as a it can get.
5	This place was apart of romance package we booked through Southwest which included dinner, the gondola ride and the wax museum. I must say we had an amazing time here at Madame Tussauds. It was my first time ever experiencing a wax museum and it was awesome. All of the wax people look so real. It was kind of creepy. I was half expecting one of them to say boo and scare the hell out of me. We got to take pictures with the wax people we liked which was great. They had Johnny Depp which was yummy. Marilyn Monroe was another one of my favorites. I am not sure how much general admission is since I booked this with a package but I highly recommend going. It is an experience definitely worth seeing.
4	This place made for a fun afternoon with friends. We used 5 dollar off coupons for admission for each person in our party from a Vegas values coupon book. We took tons of photos of each other posing with life-like wax celebrities. Some more life-like than others. The scary part of the museum was fun as well, regardless of what others say. It was just a short detour from the actual wax museum self-guided tour. We all hooted and hollered and screamed like kids. Good fun.
5	I've always wanted to go to a Madame Tussauds wax museum. So when I went here, I was super excited. I absolutely enjoyed the experience. Loved all the wax statues, some looked very realistic. Their gift shop wasn't bad either. I would definitely come back. Maybe next time I can go to the one in New York or London!
5	The best Madame Tussauds I've visited, but I've only been to this one and to the one in Hollywood,CA.  The last Tim I went, it costs $24.00//adult which can be pricey to see celebs made of wax if you're not a fan...BUT I'M A FAN! :-)
3	Although I loved how real most of the sculptures were I felt like the price I paid to see them wasn't too satisfactory for the amount of wax figures they had. I also felt like they didn't properly match some of the dolls to the scenes/rooms [ex: Marilyn Monroe was in the same room as Benjamin Franklin and Obama instead of the actors and musicians of her era, sure JFK was in that room as well but I just felt it didn't belong...Anyway those were the reasons for the deduction of two stars but otherwise the exhibit was great. In the middle of the museum you can take a free little haunted hallway trip with creepy people jumping out and almost touching you, kinda freaky but fun especially because you're kind of forced to go in with a few other people [if there are any] so you have a mini fright bonding experience. Ha ha.I would definitely visit this museum though, or whichever one you end up being close to. It's super fun to take pictures, especially with a friend !!! :]
4	This is a great way to spend an afternoon in Vegas! Especially if it is cold outside! It was a little shorter than I expected it to be, but that could be because I was a chicken and didn't go into the horror section! They have real people in there jumping out at you and I just wasn't feelin' it! My friend and I got some sweet pictures with all kinds of celebrities including Hugh Hefner and Angelina Jolie. My favorite room was the musicians room. They had an employee in there waiting for people to walk in and when you would, he would ambush you and try to talk you into singing a karaoke duet with him. Super fun and really funny! Overall, had a great time! Not sure if I would go again anytime soon, but it is a definite must do, at least once, while you are in town!Also, my friend and I were in town for a convention (Like a lot of Vegas tourists are these days!) and if you show your pass you get a super discounted rate!
2	At first, I was extremely excited to go to this wax museum. I had never been to any prior to this and had heard nothing but great things. The resemblences are uncanny. It's almost like you are just looking at the figure waiting for it to move. There were a few who were very far off. Especially Michael Jackson and Beyonce. Not even close. A thing I didn't like too much was the size. Extremely small in my opinion. My cousins went to the one in Hollywood and said it was about 3 levels. Had tons of statues. And took them awhile to walkthrough. The one in Vegas took us less than 25 minutes and we weren't rushing at all. We took pictures, video, and even went through the haunted house. If you've never been to a wax museum before, then you should go. If you have, I think you can pass on this one. $25 for admission. Luckily I had my student id and paid $18. Enjoy!
3	Three stars because of the size of the museum, not the quality of the wax figures. Just felt like there should have been more. Also...not sure about that J-Lo statue. I only realized it was her when I saw it from behind.But that said, it's a wax museum. And it's an awesome chance to take ridiculous pictures with friends. Like Hugh Hefner lounching on a love seat? Come on.Not surprising discovery: I am as tall as Shaq's nipple.Surprising discovery: I am shorter than Bieber. Fail.
4	Never thought I would have that much fun in a building filled with wax sculptures! Only paid $15, took a bunch of priceless pictures, met my childhood idol (Britney Spears) and dunked on Shaq. Oh and the optional haunted house, or whatever it is, really scared the crap out of me!!! The monsters were chasing us, i was screaming/running the whole time and ran out laughing. PRICELESS, LOL.
2	I am a big fan of Anna Maria Tussaud, the famous wax sculptor whom opened up her first wax museum in London in 1835, the one I often visited in my youth (when i was cutting school, don't read this mommy!) and I guess that's why none of the other's measure up and Las Vegas was no exception. It was extremely expensive (to me) and there were like 3 rooms with the mediocre wax statues (like seriously, that didn't even look like Tupac) and then it was the gift shop, which I think was bigger than the entire museum. The only good part of this location as opposed to the London location? When I walked out of this one I went straight to a bar and started drinking $5 margaritas...Viva Las Vegas.
4	I liked going to this wax museum. the figures look very life like. I spent alot of time taking picture my wife and I with my favorite actors and singers. Every one should check this out. Make sure you get a half price coupon or voucher before you go though. Paying full price is worth it but i am glad i didn't.
4	Living in the bay area, we have a wax museum in SF and I think this one was way more realistic. You walk in and the wax models are all over, not behind rope and lined up like other wax museums. My father in law got a little crazy with Eva Longoria, all in all nice to see and some funny pictures!
3	If you like wax museums, then you gotta go. You really don't have to pay full admission. There is always coupons for this museum. So you gotta find them. Only grip is I wish they had more wax figures.
4	Adorable little wax museum.  Everyone inside was having a blast.  You are encouraged to take photos and touch the statues.  They even provide props at some of the scenes like bunny ears for a pic with Heff or pirate costume items for a pic with Jack Sparrow.  Very enjoyable.
4	Love it! Regular admission is $25 pp but if you ask the hotel where you are staying at they should have coupons for you to get a few dollars off admission. Its fun!
4	Definitely worth visiting.  I like that they actually have interactive wax figures, such as J. Lo blushing if your grab her booty!  Some wax figures looked true to form...some other ones...I wondered if the person was slightly drunk while putting them together!  Most characters are definitely recognizable at first glance.
5	Every single time I am in Vegas I make a stop at Madame Tussaunds, it's a blast!  Since I will likely never meet a real celebrity, this is as close as I am going to get.  You are more than encouraged to take tons of photos with the wax figures as you strike a pose, grab an ass, or shoot hoops with them.  Many of the figures look VERY lifelike and others... not so much.  There are celebrities, sports stars, and political figures around every corner.  You won't be disappointed in who you run into!Be sure to grab a coupon prior to your visit so you don't pay the steep $25 entry price!
5	Absolutely love this wax museum! The last two times I was in the area, I made a stop at Madame Tussands each of those trips (they operate other locations around the country), and the second time visiting featured more celebrities like the Beatles (for a limited time only through May 2012)  and Celine Dion. You are allowed to take as many photos as you'd like and sometime can even use props to get nice pictures with the figures themselves. A lot of them are very well done and almost look like the real person! You'll see Hollywood celebrities, sports figures, historic and political figures (including Obama!), and you certainly will not be disappointed. It's well worth the admission price! (Hint: Look for coupons in various magazines to save $5 per person of the regular $25 admission.)
5	A lot of fun...just don't pay full price...go to the discount ticket office!
5	Thought the exhibit was very fun and entertaining overall.  My wife and I enjoyed the whole tour and had fun taking pictures with all the celebrities.  We enjoyed the fact that you could actually interact with the wax figures for pictures.  The Obama wax figure and presidents desk was awesome and fun for action shots :)...we ended up getting a few of those printed out by the professionals there.  Would definitely recommend for anyone to have a bit of fun on your vacation.
5	What a goofy fun time!It was so good to be indoors away from the 100 F temps!  But besides the air controlled building, this place is very entertaining and totally encourages silly behavior... which I LOVE!  Room after room, there were were plenty of waxed celebs. And surprisingly, they were incredibly realistic! I love that you can use props and do fun poses with the statues.  It's great for all ages and it's gives you the opportunity to take great photographs that you'll definitely laugh at when you're all done!  =D
4	This place was one of the highlights of my trip.  It was SO much fun!!! You can also get a discount in the Las Vegas coupon book here so try to save a few bucks ; ) You can touch the figures here without people screaming at you, and they provide here and there props like bunny ears to sit next to Heff and a bouquet to marry George Clooney. The selection of celebrities was great, and the realness is amazing! I wish it was a bigger museum though : ( I didn't want the fun to end so quickly. If you've never seen a celebrity in your life, then come have some fun at Madame Tussauds where this place provides you with a "close enough" experience to meeting a real celebrity :) Most people can't tell the difference ; )
3	Good attraction for Las Vegas . It was smaller than I thought. Some figures I did not recognize but it was a fun way to spend the evening. I think it should be expanded.
4	I had a good time with my daughter here. She's 13 and only knew some of the figures. Me, on the other hand, knew them all. Took plenty of pictures and some even came out so realistic that friends actually thought we met these celebrities. I recommend this place. It's a change from your typical Vegas scene.Price: I have nothing to compare it to since this is my first and only wax museum that I've been too. I wish I took advantage of the online deals. But was able to take advantage of the local discount
5	I got waxed!And it was fantastic!I've been having an inclination to head out to LA to visit Grauman's Chinese Theater & Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum for awhile now.  While in Vegas, we had time to kill so we decided to check out Madame Tussaud's Las Vegas.  I used Tix4Tonight to purchase ticket vouchers for $18/piece, saving myself cash money, which is hard to do when you're in Vegas.  Here's the lowdown-I had such a good time!  The resemblance of the wax figures to their real-life counterparts vary from spot-on to roughly vague.  Here, posing & touching are encouraged.  Check out my Yelp page for some of the pics I took.  Some I didn't post were a bit on the raunchy side (Fergie & Jenna Jameson, I apologize for my actions that day).  I'm not interested in Nascar/Indy Car racing, so that wing didn't appeal to me & I didn't check out the Scream Haunted House wing.  There was a plethora of wax figures, some w/ props that patrons can use when posing for the camera.  Celebs vary from Tony Bennett & Dean Martin to Katy Perry & 2pac.  Everyone of all ages should get a kick out of the celebs featured here.  There weren't too many people when I was there, so it felt like I had free run of the place, which I gleefully took advantage of.  To reiterate, I had a blast visiting Madame Tussaud's Las Vegas.  I look forward to visiting the LA location to see whom they have exhibited there.  I remember the old Hollywood Wax Museum that used to be open in Buena Park, and MT blows that out of the water.  I recommend everyone come by and check out Madame Tussaud's for themselves.  You won't regret it!Good times!
3	I don't understand why the wax figure of Jamie Foxx is so light-skinned?The images of the wax figures are so lifelike that if you take a picture and send it to someone, they will really be fooled!The museum is not that big so I wouldn't pay full price for the exhibit.  There are always specials going on on the strip so I would recommend that you not pay any more than $18.  Tickets are regularly priced at $25.This is a perfect stop for having spare time to squander.  Towards the end, there is usually a professional photographer that will take your picture with one of the popular wax figures. (They decide the figure, not you).  When I went recently, it was Barak Obama.  The pictures are for sale, but they always turn out so nice so splurge!
5	This place was awesome! We karaoked and took pics with some awesome wax figures. The trip was made even more awesome b/c the Field Ops Rockstars were there singing Living on a Prayer!!!
4	This was fun, but didn't seem to last long enough. Granted, we chose to bypass the "Scream" area because neither of us enjoy being scared very much. It was fun (and at times creepy) taking pictures next to celebrities. Some look dead on while others aren't so much. I had a buy one get 1 free coupon, which definitely helped me not be so disappointed at how short it was, but I still thought it was really fun taking a picture with a bunch of celebrities. When do you ever get a chance to do that? Overall, I think it was really fun but not long enough.
4	My husband and I were in Vegas and thought it would be fun to visit this place.  We had a blast.  I got married to George Clooney and have pictures to prove it.  Both my husband and I got to touch J Lo's butt.  Seriously, this place is cool the resemblance they have to the real person are uncanny.  We used Tix4Tonight and saved money, I highly recommend them for almost any show.  It doesn't take a lot of time to walk through the museum, we skipped the Scream area - not into being scared.  It was a nice rest from being outside all day.  If you get a chance check this place out, we both thought it was pretty cool.  That is as close as we will ever get to the stars, our daughter's favorite movie is Game Plan with The Rock in it and we were able to take pictures with his wax figure and she loved it.
5	Lots of fun, especially if you're ready to play along. Found BOGO coupons on eBay before we left for Vegas and they were taken without issue which saved a bundle!
4	Located at the Venetian, Madame Tussauds is easily accessible from the motorized walkway.The wax figures are eerily real. I wanted a picture next to Johnny Depp and the whole time I was a bit afraid that his eyes would start moving or his hand would jump up.It's quite small inside but a very fun experience.
4	I enjoyed myself way more than I expected touring this exhibit.  My wife and I enjoyed taking humorous photos of each other.
5	I adore this place! It is always fun to come take pictures with your friends and "celebrities" after a few drinks. It is also amazing to see how tiny famous people really are! You always hear that the camera adds 10 pounds and all leading men are very short but seeing their wax figures with their exact dimensions really puts it into perspective. Be sure to grab one of the coupons found in a million of those free Vegas pamphlets. It is usually $5 for each person for parties up to 4. I forgot to grab one and was annoyed with the $27 admission.
5	I love this exhibit! I try to go every time I'm in Vegas as it changes all the time. I've went 6 months apart and there were many new wax figures - totally worth going every time. It's fun to see how big/small these famous people are as TV definitely skews your perception.
4	I was really looking forward to coming here with my friends on our trip, and I wasn't disappointed.  Sure, some of the figures didn't look exactly like the real celebrities, but it was a quirky place to take some fun pictures.  If you have some free time, you should check it out!
4	Loads of fun! Great place to escape the heat too.We had a blast here goofing around taking pictures. The best part is that you can take pictures 'with' the wax figures. You can touch them, you can goof around with your posses.You can use the available props to get creative with your shots and generally just have a blast.Some of the figures are stunningly real & others are OK. Highly recommend this!
4	Since I had never been to a wax museum before, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. But Madame Tussauds proved to be a fun way to spend an hour or so on a hot Vegas day. It was fun "meeting" some of my favorite stars, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio, my childhood crush! There really was something for everyone, from today's Hollywood stars and musicians to sports heroes and historical figures. It's a great place to have fun and act goofy by taking photos with the figures. Some scenes have additional props to make the experience even better. There were definitely some figures that looked more lifelike than others and a few that I couldn't even figure out who it was supposed to be. We stopped by the haunted section, which wasn't that impressive. They had us walk through the dark, twisty path in a single file line and people randomly jumped out at you. Other than that, you couldn't see anything and it wasn't especially scary. We were handed coupons for $10 off on the Strip and that made the experience much more affordable and enjoyable.
4	This place is so fun. I felt like a kid taking pics with my favorite celebs, truly a dream come true :) Although the place could be a little bit bigger.There are political figures, actors, actresses, athletes, and musicians.  Some of the celebrities looked very authentic and others looked too... waxy? The SCREAM haunted house was super fun... yet scary!It's a good escape from the all the Vegas hustle and bustle. You have to visit Madame Tussauds for some carefree fun.
3	Some were good, some were bad. But the place seemed small for the price of admission.  My GF mentioned that they didn't have lots of the figures she's seen before, and there were a couple of blocked off sections. So I think they were renovating and had a smaller selection of figures... but they didn't charge us less for said shittier selection.
4	I'd never been to a MT before and I enjoyed it. The Ladies in the gift shop where super cool and very helpful. The sculptures where all very realistic and in poses you could have fun with. Theres a wide range of characters as well, so something for everyone. Dont bother with the haunted house. It was short and lame. And they are very stringent when it comes to "both hands on the shoulders in front of you" which for how much they yell it, I hope theres really good logic. I'd recommend the museum, but not the haunted house.
5	My wife and I did the "After Dark" Halloween tour and it really didn't disappoint... who wouldn't want to go through a dimmly lit wax museum with real people in costumes hidding amongst wax figures jumping out at you to scare you?We're planning on doing the standard tour on our next Vegas outting...
2	I think we just went on an off day. The scary part was entirely closed. It said someone would be back at 6.45, but it was after then and there was no one around. The photographers were completely ignoring us, so my mum and I couldn't get a picture with us both in it, and the bar was unstaffed. The main parts I wanted to see were Lady GaGa (which I did) and the scary part (nope), and we could only take pictures of each other, not one with both, so it was kind of a bust.I do like that you are free to touch and pose with all the wax figures, though. I'd go back again and give it another shot.
5	We were impressed.First of all we had a coupon from our hotel and the very nice lady at the entrance desk picked up on the fact that we were military. Without hesitation they offered us a larger military discount. I was impressed to say the least.The displays were very cool and the accuracy was pretty incedible.Then after getting home they manage to impress us again. It appeared that we were double billed on our CC.  I sent a simple email and within a short period of time there was a message on my phone asking how they can assist with resolving the issue.   For various reasons I wasn't able to return the call so they sent me an email.  Wow, phone call and then a follow up email to an issue where they could have captured additional money.On top of everything everyone we encountered at the location were very friendly.Enjoy!
4	Madame Tussauds a night of family fun. I got to take pictures with wax figurines of some of the greatest stars like Nicolas Cage, Larry King, Madonna, Elvis Presley, Robert Deniro and even the President Barrack Obama. I also wont forget the scream exhibit .
4	A fun little place. I and wifey had a ball of a time clicking pictures with the Hollywood celebrities and sports stars. Some of the wax rendering may have been a little off,  but overall it was a good place to get some cheeky snaps. I have been to the one in times square before, and I have a feeling that it is a little better than the one in Las Vegas.The photo's that you can take over here are better than the one in NY. Our photo with the wax statue of President Obama came out very well :D.
4	Do you want to rub elbows with the likes of Madonna, Celine, and Johnny Depp? Their elbows are made of  wax but you can still do it! They let you pose and touch the wax figurines at Madame Tussauds. I was anxious to look at all of them and took some pictures with a few. They also have interactive sets like Jerry Springer, Larry King and American Idol. You can even sing karaoke on the American Idol set I was tempted to because the lady who was on sounded really bad. Think back to the movie "My Best Friend's Wedding...you get the picture. I figured I couldn't  do any worse but my shyness got the better of me once again!! They even have a little mini haunted area that is free with your admission. I can't really say anything about it because I'm a chicken.  I held on to my husband with eyes closed walking briskly through it. I think it lasted 5 minutes.The gift shop had so many cute things in it. I wanted all of their Hello Kitty Wall. You can even get a personalized bobble head. It takes a couple of weeks and it costs a couple of hundred dollars! It was a good time and my sister and law who has been to the one in New York and Los Angeles says this one is bigger and better!
4	We did not expect to have such a good time at Madame Tussauds, but we did.  Of course, some of the wax figures were way off to the point that I didn't know who the heck they were.  But others were very life like.  They even had some interactive displays for visitors to make it interesting.  Wouldn't you want to know what its like to  sound like Prince? or lean forward and bust a move like Michael Jackson?  They even shake it up a bit with a haunted house in the middle of the museum if you choose to do it.  We did it, and people were actually screaming!  Not a a bad deal for $18-$25 bucks.
4	I have walk by Madame Tussauds many times and even have stayed at the Venetian however never seemed to make the time to go in. My brother and I were in town last weekend and he wanted to go so I reluctantly said OK lets do it. I am glad I did well worth the money spent - Lot's to see, bring a camera plenty of pic opportunities. A lot of the figures are spot on. Great experience for the whole family - give it a try - I am glad that I did.
5	I came here last time I was in Vegas. I was especially excited to go because they had just recently put Gwen Stefani in the museum! She's my fave!It's neat to see all the statues and since they are supposed to be made to scale you can see how you measure up. I never realized how tall/short some of the celebrities are! The statues are also set up for photo opportunities, some better than others. For example, Hugh Hefner has a bed set up with bunny ear props you can put on. However the pop stars are just standing around, so you have to be more creative if you want to make a fun photo. You can also have a photo taken in front of their Vegas backdrop, but it's about $15.00 to purchase in the gift shop.When I went they also had a haunted scream tour. It's at the end of the exhibit and you walk through a haunted area complete with dark hallways, strobe lights and crazy actors. This is completely optional. You can also get a photo taken here for purchase at the gift shop.I would recommend Madame Tussauds to people who are looking to sight see in Vegas. If you plan on going and like to save money, there are usually coupons in the magazine books in the hotel rooms. If you don't find coupons there, sometimes you can get discounts from people outside the museum. They go out and offer discounts when they are slow.
3	This was my first time at a wax museum, don't tend to go to them but my cousin was visiting from Asia and wanted to go. We got tickets at the same day ticket place for $20 each which is okay. I try not to be touristy, but I'll admit,   It was fun to take pictures with some my favorite celebs.  Got a pic with Obama, Shaq, both MJ's and a few others.  It looks bigger from the outside and we got through it pretty quick but enjoyed it. The photos are a bit of a rip off tho - 2 for $20.
4	We came here last year during may which was hot as hell so I can only imagine how it must be here during the summer. Anyway the representation of all the celeb's was pretty cool. We took out time walking around and enjoying clicking away on the camera like a pair or tourist. Which we were! We even got trapped in doing that themed pic at the entrance right before you walk in. Classic! Anyway as cheesy as it is it's still pretty fun. I failed and should of sat between Jenna Jameson legs and posed like a fool for everyone. lol
2	I've been to the Madame Tussauds in DC and New York, but I really wanted to see this one for one reason and one reason only-Gwen Stefani. I'm such a Gwen fan and always voted for her to have a wax figure at the surveys at the end of the museums. So she's finally a wax and when I was planning my trip to Vegas, I knew I had to see her.Not to sound weird, but when I say I am a Gwen fan, I mean I am a Gwen fan. So naturally I got an outfit to look just like her wax to stand side by side for a perfect picture. I had the blonde hair, neon bra, combat boots, everything.We get here and I tell the girl who printed our tickets we were there to see Gwen. We walk in, pass the movie stars, see the music room..but no Gwen. Hmm, that's weird. Maybe she's in the next room..no..So I ask the "dj" by the American Idol section."Oh Gwen is in New York."WHAT?Okay, so remember when I said I only came here for Gwen? We walk out of the museum and back to the entrance. We wait behind a few people and when we get to the counter, I start to explain. A manager comes over. He kinda listens, but is really looking at my tickets."..You were in there for ten minutes.""Yes, I didn't see Gwen and she really is the only figure I wanted to see. If there is any way you could refund the tickets because I really came here for Gwen. Look I'm wearing her outfit." *I hold up the brochure* (We are like, twins. Except Gwen is skinny and much prettier.)"Our wax figures rotate and she's borrowed.""Yeah I heard that. I'm so sad she's not here.""..But I see you spent ten minutes in the museum.""Okay..?"So he's implying I was enjoying the museum and shouldn't get my money back. Then he starts making up something about how we paid with a debit card and he can only refund the money if I paid in cash."How about vouchers for a future visit?""I don't live here, I live in Seattle."Thinking about how much money I had just wasted ($40) not to mention the little outfit I put together, I started to cry. Silly, I know, but I felt really bad. Because to me, $40 is a lot of money for nothing."Okay, let me see what I can do."He leaves and comes back."Here you go, I've refunded the money to your debit card."Well, thanks..but why did you just say you couldn't? I had to cry for you to believe me? So got the money back, but what a lot of trouble. And disappointment.If you're here to look at the figures in general, I'm sure you'll have a good time. And look for a coupon in the Welcome to Las Vegas books. Unfortunately, my experience was this.
5	Great place to visit while in Vegas. You can take pictures with many stars and even grope them at the same time. Where else can you do this and get away with it? Very fun experience and discounts are available too.
4	I went to Madame Tussauds while I was visiting Las Vegas. Madame Tussauds was one of the attractions on my Las Vegas Power Pass. Madame Tussauds was a cool experience. Some of the wax figures looked real. I like how some of the figures had cool props for picture taking. Shaq,MJ, and Snoop Dogg was my favorite wax figures. You can take as many pictures as you want. I went to Madame Tussauds early so I wouldn't be rushed taking pictures (less crowded). The staff was friendly. If you have some down time in Las Vegas, visitng Madame Tussauds is a good choice.
4	Great museum with a TON of super realistic looking statues. My only minor complaint is that it was a tax expensive, but that's a tourist thing for ya.
5	Great fun. We took lots of photos. Some of the hands on the wax figures are too shiny and that kinda gives it away. Overall a fun time was had and we will definitely go again. Be sure to get a coupon from a street vendor book.
2	I know it is kitschy but we were looking to kill some time with the kids before my brother's rehearsal dinner and MT was right across the street from our hotel. I've visited the MT in NYC and this place pales in comparison. We had a lot of fun playing "Wow, that figure looks NOTHING like the real person" but that didn't stop us from doing a lot of silly posing.  We were able to get tickets for half-price which is wonderful as this place is NOT worth full price. On the whole, this place is just meh.
5	I went last year with my hubby and had a blast taking pics with some of our favorite celebrities. Completely recommend it to anyone that is looking for something fun to do. I was a little creeped out when I had to go back into one of the rooms by myself, but it was funny in the end I really enjoyed it.
4	Great exhibit. Something different. Wax figures look so realistic! A must go
3	I have always loved wax museums, Madame Tussauds is always on the top of my list.  I couldn't pass up a chance to see this in Vegas, so Hubby and I got tickets through one of those discount booths on the Strip, and off to the Venetian we go...It was a Wednesday in April, so the place wasn't too busy.  We were able to take photos with each of the wax statues in our own pace.  We didn't have to stand in line or have other people in our pictures.  We went at a good time and it was empty!  The only complaint I had was that 2 sections of the museum were closed "due to an event".  There was supposedly a section on horror films... which was my FAVORITE section... CLOSED.  The white house portion was also closed down... hence the reason Obama was moved over to where Larry King Live was.  So bummed I didn't get to see both of those sections.Another thing is, next time I'm in Vegas I probably won't come back... this was fun for one time.
5	Great schmaltzy fun. It's very easy to get a discounted ticket (lots of vendors outside giving coupons away, coupon books in all the taxicabs etc) and it's definitely worth it if you think wax figures are hilarious like I do. Of particular amusement are the statues of Hugh Hefner and Jenna Jameson which make for great photo opportunities. There's a nice candy/souvenir shop at the end of the museum too, lots of novelty candy and delightfully tacky fake Oscar statue memorabilia. Overall, great for an afternoon laugh and memorable Las Vegas photo ops.
5	This place was fun. I kept thinking I was about to run into someone or someone was behind me since there is figures everywhere. Definitely a place to check out in Vegas if you're there, Adults were about twenty eight bucks, but I totally had a great time.
3	Pretty cool but make sure you get a coupon from one of the people on the street... 28 bucks a person was way too much for a half hour of amusement, although this did make for some pretty cool photos.
3	Place is a little overpriced at $30 per ticket. We got discounted tickets or we may not have gone in. It takes about 20 minutes or less to walk around the museum. Very disappointed Johnny Depp was missing (apparently someone had scratched up his face). Tim McGraw looked real but most of the other figures looked really fake. Still had fun looking at the statues and worth seeing, if you can get a discount. I wouldn't pay full price though.
4	This is a pretty fun place. It wasnt something I knew about, but I'm glad I found out about. It's a great tourist site, or a great place to play tourist if you're a local. They have a wide array of celebs, from contemporary like lady gaga to historical like Benjamin Franklin. There's also random surprises like the karaoke machine in the music room. Anyone can join in and serenade the rest of the visitors. One thing which I have to say is that you really do need to have a partner with you so you can get pictures. I'm generally one to do solo adventures and this isn't really one. I also loved the props, I got to drink a martini with James Bond and be Elvis' 1920s flapper sidekick and also kick it with Obama. I'd definately recommend this place
4	I debated on going here simply because it's such a touristy thing to do, but decided to go anyway.  I had a great time getting pictures and doing silly poses with most of the wax celebrities.  I went during the week so it wasn't that crowded...except the Michael Jackson figure had a line because each person was changing into Smooth Criminal costumes before taking their pictures.  Each wax figure pretty much looked like the celebrity.  Some capture the likeness so good that it's a bit freaky.  There are a few exhibits where staff try to tempt you into buying a copy of their picture.  It's pretty unnecessary if you have a camera or a decent cell phone camera.  The only figure I was disappointed in was Cameron Diaz.  Hers seemed to make her look better than what I think she looks in person.  I think the Tupac figure had bullet wounds on his chest from when he was murdered; if true was a bit unnecessary considering there were no bullet wounds on JFK or Martin Luther King Jr.NOTE:  It's $30 per person to get in.  Pick up a coupon book at the Monorail for a $5 off coupon or catch one of those guys on the sidewalk offering 50% off coupons.  Or Google an offer online before you make the trip to Vegas.  I checked in on Yelp and didn't see a special offer, but seems like there are coupons everywhere, so there should be no reason to pay full price to get in.
3	It was awesome to see our favorite actors and actresses in wax and pose with them. But it took us only 30 min max to get through it and that was with taking pics of everything, the cost for that about $30.00 a person. Unless of course if your a local $15.00 or you bring in a Pepsi can for buy one get one free. Some of the figures looked so REAL and some were close. I went 2 years ago at this same location and they did have some different ones there but, also the old ones too. If I can get a deal I probably will go again in the future.
5	My boyfriend and I went here on our last night in Vegas. I was super excited, but he was a little skeptical about taking pictures with wax people. Needless to say, we had a great time! The props and sculptures were great, and we had a blast acting like children and posing for the camera.
3	My girlfriend and I were looking for something fun and cool to do. It's quite pricy for the size, but it will only be fun if you make it fun. Bring a good camera, do some great poses, and have a great time!
4	Good solid tourist entertainment....be sure to use a coupon and its worth it.
4	I have talked myself out of coming to this for years, but man am I glad I finally came. This is a great place to take fun pictures with PROPS with your fav celebs. I had a buy one get one ticket I had out of the American Casino Guide ( recommended) and the tickets were half off. They have everything from boxing with Muhammad Ali, golfing with Tiger Woods, or laying in bed with a bottle of champagne with Hugh Hefner.  Great pictures!
4	I love this place! its so awesome! haha getting up close to the fake celebrities lmao! i had a great time here! but i felt like i rushed it :( because i was so excited to rushed over in the next rooms to look at more celebrities awaiting out there.... unfortunately it came to a stop and they close down some other rooms....it stopped at thor!! idk if that was it or not! BUT WHY!... This place is known to be haunted by ghost because i saw an episode from ghost adventures! HAHA creepyI got 20$ off my visit here because the people who stood outside passes out those coupons or whatever, its $10off up to 4 people and it was just me and my sister and apparently its -$10/each COOL!
4	Got tickets at a discounted price of $16 versus the retail price of $30 (this is important because the experience was a good deal at $16 but probably not worth it at $30).The museum has a good number of life size wax statues, maybe 40 or so, crammed into 6 or 7 rooms. They make things interesting by making the experience interactive - for example, you can take pictures of yourself in front of Jerry Springer with the TV captions "I like the way my armpits smell", "I got buttock implants so I could wear my favorite jeans", or "I collect my toenail clippings".For some reason, the wax statues of female celebrities (Angelina Jolie, Eva Longoria, Lindsay Lohan, etc.) seem more "real" compared to statues of male celebrities (Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, etc.)Overall, a fun experience, and I would go again with someone who has not been there before just to see their reaction. However, I wouldn't pay full price, nor would I go only with people who had already been there ... too boring otherwise.
4	Madame Tussauds is a must see when you're in Vegas. We had a blast taking photos with the wax statues. It's not pricey at all. You pay $20 to get in and you can spend as much time as you want in there. They have heaps of sports persons, actors and other celebrities...... The Rock was standing guard at the entrance. Inside, to name a few; you had Daniel Craig, Will Smith, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Sandra Bullock, Jenna Jameson (yes I know she's a pornstar and a good one I may add.. Come on.. I'm a only a man..), Michael Jordan, Chris Hemsworth (aka Thor), Bono, Celine Dion, Barrack Obama in the Oval Office, Neil Armstrong, Tiger Woods, Andre Agassi, Eva Longoria, Katy Perry, Snoop Doggy Dog and plenty more. It's a shame they don't have a statue of David Beckham - that would have been seriously awesome!It was great fun and I loved it. I highly recommend it and make sure you check out the shop on your way out. It's a great place to get some souvenirs you know.... Something different instead of getting the usual magnet or postcard or whatever..
5	These things scared the crap out of me!  At one point I was alone in a room and I really thought Tony Bennett was going to come to life.  I hauled ass outta there and met up with my friends.   Every one of them was more realistic then the next.  The detail was incredible!It was very cool that they allow you to touch the figures.  They even have costumes and props you can put on to take fun photos.  We ordered our tickets online the night before and paid half price!
5	If you want to go see the museum and you're doing Vegas on a budget, go to one of those timeshare presentations (don't buy anything and be prepared to spend 3-4 hours, not the 2 hours they claim)Tickets are $30pp and we would not have paid to see this!My husband and I had a great time, playing with the wax celebrities and most of the exhibits were interactive, which was fun.
1	Way overpriced and not enough wax figures to see. Very disappointed and would never go back.
5	During our stay in Las Vegas staying at the Venetian Hotel we ran across a deal to check out this museum right outside.  Although the place hadn't been open for very long prior to our visit you could already see that it had a substantial following.Madame Tussaud's is a wax museum brought into the 21st century with interactive elements that really help set it apart from the crowd.  Have you ever wanted to experience playing a game of Basketball against Shaquille O'Neal?  Have you ever wanted to experience what it would be like to be a Playboy Bunny or to party with Mel Gibson?  Have you wanted to play Tennis with Andre Agassi or be judged by Simon Cowell on the American Idol stage?  All of these things and much more can be done at this museum.  In just one trip here, I partied with Mel Gibson (Booze bottle in hand), played some hoops with Shaq, groped J-Lo's butt and made her blush (statues cheeks actually turn red), played poker with Ben Affleck & even punched Jeff Gordon in the face (What can I say? I'm an Earnhardt fan) as well as a half dozen more feats.  This museum is fun and really brings the wax figures to life and gives them personality beyond anything else I have seen.  The pricing to get in is reasonable, the place is a decent size and consists of several themed rooms from athletes (Shaw, Andre Agassi, Tiger Woods & Jeff Gordon), Musicians (Madonna, J-Lo, Michael Jackson) to Historical Figures (George Bush, Neil Armstrong, Martin Luther King).  The place has something for everyone and I highly recommend checking it out.  For those who do not want to make the trek to Sin City (The City of Lost Wages) they have more recently opened a Hollywood location as well near the Chinese Theater and Walk of Fame.  I will definitely be back here again and to also check out the new location as well.
5	We came here on a Tuesday afternoon and used the Casino Guide coupon BOGO. We got 2 adult tickets for $29.95. When you are walking on the strip, they hand out the $5 off admission or if you're a couple, the 2 for $45. Even if you purchase your ticket online, and you're a local, it comes out to $19.47, so the Casino Guide seems to beat the rest. - Next to the Venetian- Great place to take pictures! A-MUST!- TV, film, sports, Hollywood, Music, LV legends. - It took us about 45min to take a picture with each model- Lots of fun. I think what's best about this compared to other wax/model museums is that you can touch them. Touch J-Los famous asset, and her cheeks blush! Haha. - They have different kinds of props too, so that you can get into character. Be apart of the Jerry Springer Show. Perform the famous MJ forward lean with the white glove, and so much more. - I'm glad that they are planning on opening a Madame Tussauds in SF, bc what the wax museum that they have now is put to shame compared to Madame Tussauds. - There were 2 professional photo-ops. One where you enter. You can hold a sign that says "YOLO". And another with Elvis in his car.- At the end of the museum, you end up at the gift shop. Take a picture with the huge Oscar!
5	I am super silly, but this was a bucket list item of mine. I HAD to go! We bought our tickets discounted at a place on the strip so we did not pay the full price of what you pay when you go, but I still would have paid full price if I had to. I thought this was some good, clean fun, especially considering all the entertainment in Vegas! IF you bring minors to Vegas, this is a great option for you. Too fun! Have a drink first so you can loosen up and take some goofy pictures! You walk through and there is no rush on how fast or slow you go.Very life like of each person. My favorites were Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Michael Jackson, Katy Perry, Tim McGraw, Jerry Springer (I like how you could sit in the chair and it would give you a 'show' . I guess they change the wax people sometimes? But I liked it, it's as close as I'll ever get to a star!!! haha
5	We went to Madame Tussaud's when we visited Las Vegas last month, because its just one of those major tourist attractions that you see when you're in town. It rocked. The wax faces were amazing. I knew it would be cool but it was much more than I expected. We spent quite a bit of time in there, posing with all the statues. It made for an awesome afternoon on our honeymoon.
2	Kinda pricey at 30 a head to look at some wax statues. Sure they are realistic but it really wasn't our cup of tea! It's 2hrs of my life I wish I could get back!
4	So we got to come here for their VIP night last week and being I had never been here before it was a nice surprise. We weren't sure what to expect but you started out in the club room with johnny depp and george clooney, a good start! They served appetizers and drinks, had a DJ and plenty of places to sit.  There was a picture opportunity as well but as with one or two others I wasn't sure with who the figure was supposed to be.  (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars).  As you continue room to room there is a different theme, different appetizers were served based on the theme and drinks to match.  there were about 4 different places to get a professional photo op and we had fun posing as some had props.  Each guest got a picture to take home as well which is a nice momento.  We each also got a Madame Tussauds small bottle of sparkling wine to take with us.  There were plenty of fun moments throughout the night but the 4D superhero movie was probably our favorite part.  Its only 10 minutes but it was quite fun and entertaining.  Thanks to yelp for this opportunity and a night filled with memories that continue to make us laugh.
1	We bought our ticked online to get the 20% off discount. Upon arriving we were told that they were closed for a private party. Instead of having a register open to refund our money at that time, we were told it would take 5-7 days to issue a refund. They took our information down on a piece of paper and send us on our way. That was on 11/13/13. No refund has been issued. No one has returned our MULTIPLE calls and emails. This is so beyond acceptable, I am at a loss.So moral of the story, if you want to take a change and get the discount online, go for it, hopefully they won't be hosting a "private party", turn you away, and STEAL your money.
3	We were fortunate to be invited to a private party to celebrate their grand reopening with the addition of the Marvel Super Heroes 4D attraction. Overall I was impressed with the majority of the wax likenesses, although there were some that looked a bit weird or didn't quite resemble their real counterparts. The highlight for us was the new Marvel attraction which was located at the very end, just prior to the gift shop. Amazingly, we actually had the whole theater to ourselves. Even though it was kind of cheesy, we had fun and some good laughs nonetheless. Not a bad way to spend one or two hours, especially if you can get a discount.
2	Warning: To all future Vegas tourists, this is Overpriced. All to see wax figures of celebrities. Thank god I didn't pay for it and thankfully we got a discount at the entrance but regular entrance fees are outrageous. Also it's $2.75 for a bottle of water.
5	Michele won tickets through Yelp to the Madame Tussauds V.I.P. party.  So, we used it as a date night and got all gussied up.  I even wore a tie.  Weird, I know!  But, we come to find that we were over dressed.  Maybe it's just me, but when it says V.I.P. party, I think you should show up looking decent.  But, it is Vegas and it's not a big deal.  Anyhow, we make the trek to Madame Tussauds and check in at the front desk.  We were given wrist bands and off we went into the party.Our first encounter was the Paparazzi as you enter.  We walk in and we see the A-List wax figures of celebrities.  Brad Pitt, Leonardo, Angelina Jolie etc...  Michele wanted a picture of her standing next to Bradley Cooper.  She sent the picture to a couple of her friends and they thought it was real.  Side note: there were places to sit and enjoy each room.  DJ's played music, waiters walking around with finger foods and drinks, and mini buffets set up every where.I don't remember the order of all of the rooms but, we saw sports, rat pack, musicians, Elvis and Superheroes in different stages of the party.  At the end of the walk there was a 10 minute 4 D Marvel movie to experience.  That was probably the highlight of the evening.  We were also allowed 2 free pictures that were taken by the staff.  It was a fun night.
5	I've always wanted to go to a Madame Tussuads and I was NOT disappointed! The wax figures were on point and the interactive sections were a nice touch. The only downfall is that it's a little small but it's a definite must-see.
2	Meh. I've experienced better.Paid full price to take myself and the two kids, which on reflection would have been better spent staying at the pinball museum.It was nice to be allowed to touch the figures which made getting photo's better but the the lighting is so bad it's almost impossible to get a good pic. I noticed quite a number of the figurines were missing, maybe the ok to touch policy has a draw back ?In summary the two kids ages 8 and 10 loved it, they even liked the 4d marvel movie which I was just sadly disappointed in the animation. I thought it was overpriced and a waste of time.
3	Thank god we didn't pay full price to get into. This attraction is way over priced for what they have there and have to pay extra for the 4D show is the topper. If it is a must see for you buy your tickets from the half price ticket places one is located just outside Paris. Do not pay full price not worth it.
4	I been wanting to go to Madame Tussauds since FOREVER! Ive walked past it plenty of times in Hollywood but I always felt that the price was a little too much to see a bunch of Wax people! So, when i got the opportunity for a chance to check it out in Vegas i jumped for it automatically! Located on the side of Venetian is where this Wax museum stood, and at $30 per adult you get 4 levels of fun including a 4D movie at the very end! Upon walking in you are greeted by flashing parazzi and than it led you to escalator of stars and thats where the first floor of celebrities were located. Stars were scattered everywhere and the photoops starts! Our favorite floor was the Musician floor, it allowed a interactive stage where you actually can pick a song and sing on a elevated stage where Waxed Simon Cowell was seated. After your done singing you actually get judged by Mr. Cowell! There were also a green room spot where you can pose like Michael Jackson! Than to add icing on the cake was the 4D movie with the marvel characters and I absolutely loved it, I am not much of cartoons but really that was pretty awesome!I think the $30 was actually worth everything, just check out the pictures!
4	If you're in Vegas and have a couple hours to kill, definitely check this place out. Had a blast with a friend and a camera... We must've taken 50 pics . Hugh Hefner is the best!
5	This was my second time visiting this location. Last time I went with the wifey it was about 5 years ago. From what I remember I think we paid 25 bucks each. Now I see that it has bumped up to 29. Kids 3 to 12 are 20 bucks each. Kids under 3 are free. They even have a family price for a family of 4 for 60 bucks.Of course you can go to tix4tonight down the street for a discount. You can also purchase discounted tickets online as well. Before I go on I just want to bring up the fact that the crew from Ghost Adventures did an episode here back in June of 2011. I did not know this until I started reading some of the tips on the business listing. Now I know why it felt like something was watching me while my picture was being taken with certain celebrities. As if it wasn't already creepy enough that these figures can seem like they can come alive at any moment (except for Jenna Jameson. She can come alive any time im next to her), imagine what these figures see walking around late at night when nobody is there. *chills.As for layout of the place, they have themes like a sports section with Shaquille O'Neal, Tiger Woods, Joe Montana, etc. An old school Vegas section with the Rat Pack, Wayne Newton, Elvis Presley, etc. You get my drift.So if you have never been here or plan on going again and have just got done reading this review, my suggestion would be to take a lot of pics whether its with your camera phone, a regular digital camera, or go all professional and bust out with a Canon top of the line Eos series model. Better yet, get a old school classic and bust out with a Polaroid Camera. This way, pics taken right away are developed and you know there is no doctoring of photos taken. Originally, I was gonna give this place 4 stars, but now knowing that it has a history, it has been bumped up to 5. The Sands, a casino/hotel property which was built by the mob, used to be here years ago. Of course it was torn down to make way for the Venetian. I can only imagine how many people were tortured and/or murdered on this hallowed ground. So now this place should be more interesting now that you have learned a bit of history. I know I was intrigued.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #46
5	The end of February was my first time visiting Vegas with my sisters and we figured we might as well check all the sights off our bucket lists. One of my oldest sisters has been very sick and we knew that this would sadly be the last trip we could all take together. We took a lot of pictures in the attraction and also participated in the two professional photo opportunities. I didn't plan on purchasing any of those photos but a young lady whose name was either Jennifer or Jessica convinced me otherwise. I'm so happy I did because my sister passed a couple of days ago and now I have those pictures to last me a life time. You can put a wax attraction any where, but this location in particular had some of the kindest employees I've encountered. Five stars for me.
4	They offer a discount for locals and we also had a $10 off coupon so for 4 people to get in, it was $65. Had we not had the discounts admission wouldn't have really been worth the money. Most of the wax figures look exactly like the stars. Sometimes it's hard to even tell if the figurines are humans or not. It's nice not having staff around staring at you awkwardly while you make a fool of yourself posing with the wax figures. At the end the offer a 4D cartoon movie experience based off of iron man. That was pretty cool. It sprayed water and bubbles on us, plus the floor vibrates and shakes. Pretty cool.
3	The wax figures were pretty dead on to the real things so I have to give props for that. Plus, for certain celebrities, they have props nearby to help make your photo with them a bit more fun. However, I did feel like the whole attraction went by pretty quickly if you're just there to look at the wax figures and not take pictures, but that's just me. They are nice to look at, but I just wish there was a bit more.Also, I wasn't really sure if they had a horror section when I went, but I did see that they had some kind of scary portion to it, but it looked more like a walk through haunted house of some kind instead of a horror movie monster section of the museum.Anyway as I've said, the quality and likeness of the figures is great, so I would say to visit this place as just a little something to do during the day around Vegas.Plus, I got to touch Criss Angel's butt. Well.... his wax figure's butt anyway. On accident. My hand brushed against his butt. When I was taking a picture with him. So... that was pretty cool.
5	Was a great time! Every once and a while I was expecting the figures to turn to me and say hello. They honestly look that real. Make sure to try and use a 50% off coupon from online, or get your tickets from tix4tonight. It is a really cool museum to check out but $30 a person would have been a little to much. We were able to pay $30 for two people.Favorites included: Brad & Angelina, Hugh, Tupac, and Shaq
5	They look so real!Seriously, the wax figures look really real right down to the last detail.  You feel like you are in a room full of people and even though they aren't real, I still felt the urge to respect their personal space like they are people.  lol.I initially thought that this would be a room or two of wax figures but be prepared, there is a lot of them, room after room.  For a second there, I thought I would never get out, but then again it was so cool, I wouldn't have minded.  There are a lot of set-ups so that you can get a good photo opportunity.They also have a cool gift shop at the end with Elvis sunglasses that have sideburns hanging from them which made me laugh.  Bummed I didn't buy a pair.
5	This place is awesome. So much fun to have here posing with the incredibly life like figures. Check out the 4D show downstairs by the marvel comics section. AMAZING!!!
4	Could not resist the 2for$39 price for admission so decided to check it out. I've been to the Museum in New York City back in 2002 and was excited to have an opportunity to visit the updated exhibits here in Las Vegas as I took a break from the Casinos where I wasn't doing so well.As we approached the ever growing line of enthusiast the excitement started to build as my wife and I prepared our cameras for some major photo sessions with some of our favorite Celebs...probably the closest we'll ever get to the real thing without getting arrested. The staff was always efficient and friendly and kept the crowd under control ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience at Madame Tussauds.We proceeded to the first level of lifelike replicas of the rich and famous snapping and enjoying ourselves in a room filled with "Oooz" and "Ahhhz" and continued on to each level of displays and exhibits doing the same, until we reached a room of super heroes where a crowd had gathered waiting to watch a 3D video. There apparently was some kind of delay and the rooms capacity was not enough to support the developing amount of people entering, so we , along with several others decided to continue on. Exiting through a door that led into a gift shop. I thought to myself (was that it?) There was something still missing from the whole experience. The Las Vegas museum lacks the tribute and fails to elaborate on the history of the Madame herself and some of her early works. Maybe the intent was to make it less gory and more family friendly. Even though I enjoyed my Las Vegas visit to Madame Tussads I still think that the Museum in New York was more of the total experience that the Museum has to offer.
5	My bestie was visiting from out of town, so I was sure to include this on the itinerary! Located in the Venetian, this is a great way to spend an hour or two during the day. Be sure to use the local discount (I believe it came out to be $40ish for 2 people), the $5-10 off coupons from either the coupon booklet or coupons handed out on the Strip, or check the Tix4Tonight counter for an even greater discount. Lots and lots of wax figurines. They rotate these across the Madame Tussauds around the world. Highlights included: Hugh Hefner, Liberace (with piano), Ben Affleck on table, Lilo (with booze), Lucille Ball, and Jerry Springer (which comes with a TV that changes up the scandalous byline once you sit on the hot seat). Plenty of great photo-ops, but I must say that the bunny ears and robe from the Hugh Hefner one needs to be replaced. They're too old and limp (LOL). There's a Lady Gaga wax figurine right outside and Joan Rivers right when you enter. The minute we entered, my bestie and I thought the Joan one was a real person since she's had SO MUCh work done HAR HAR HAR. The opening room is actors/actresses and later on there's athletes, talk-show and TV hosts, and then some vintage Vegas (think Rat Pack, Liberace, Elvis, etc.). There's also a cute Marilyn Monroe and Liz Taylor one for the glamor obsessed, complete with vanity and jewels to put on.The last room with the Avengers was probably the least exciting. First off, they don't have all the Avengers (HELLO? Where's Captain America and Thor?), and second off, the Hulk one is too "animated." I mean, we paid $40+ bucks to see wax figurines of celebrities, not FICTIONAL characters.I must say though that the Rihanna one was spot-on, complete with tattoos. They're really meticulous with these, but my friend and I kept asking if the height was accurate. They seems so short in person. My only other complaint is there they don't have the entire Rat Pack (just Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis). But where's dreamy Peter Lawford? The exhibit ends with a cute gift shop that has adorable One Direction merchandise. I really wanted to buy one of their giant ass 1D mugs. There's also Oscar replicas and other film-related gifts. Again, great way to spend a morning or afternoon at the Venetian. My friend and I started with the gondola ride, then the wax museum, and then shopping at the Grand Canal Shoppes.
4	Came down here with my friend who has never been down the strip ever!  So we walk all the way to the Wax Museum.  The place was fun and made for great pictures to do fun posses with.  We had a blast!  The 4D movie was not that impressive and I don't appreciate getting wet. So they loose a star for the not so good movie.
4	If I hadn't been in Vegas with my friend I likely wouldn't have done Madame Tussauds. It's just not my thing, but my friend suggested it as something to do on our last day, and it ended up being a lot of fun. The museum I think costs $16/person, but if you head to the Tix 4 Tonight kiosks you could half price tickets like we did. We went in the morning when it wasn't too busy, but I think it could get much busier as the day goes on. You wander through the museum and you can see various wax figures of celebrities, musicians, athletes, as well as Vegas celebs (like Sigfried and Roy, and Liberace). There was also a super hero exhibit at the very end, but most of it's still under construction.This is just a fun place to visit and snap cheesy photos posing with celebrities (as well as remark "wow I didn't know he/she was that short/tall/thin/large"). They have little plaque cards besides the figures with some info about the person there, but really you don't want to read a plaque about Shaq, you just want to take a photo next to the Shaw wax figure. At the very end there's a 4D movie, based on the superhero exhibit. It was fun, but my friend (who's been to Madame Tussauds in NYC) said it's the same one she saw there, so if you've been to Madame Tussauds before you can skip this. Actually you could probably skip the museum entirely; I have a feeling 99% of the exhibits are pretty much the same from one Madame Tussauds to another. Still it was a fun way to kill an hour.
4	A must do for Visitors at least once a lifetime. Amazing likenesses of some. Look for coupons,always available somewhere.
4	Super fun, was relieved there were no cheesy tour guides, total freedom to wander around and pose with the figures.  Went to the after 6pm special and it made it worth the price, would have been disappointing if I had paid $30.  The new superhero show was my favorite part.  Most of the Figurines looked real.
4	Great break from the heat.  Fun stuff to do in here and the new addition of the Marvel 4D experience is pretty cool.  You can take as much time as you like once you enter.  Take lots of pictures and have a great time.  All ages can go through, but be forewarned there is a corner with a Playboy theme.  Gift shop is loaded with all kinds of items.
5	My kids absolutely loved Madame Tussauds! Right now they have a 4D Marvel show and it was awesome. Especially to my 5 year old son. Its a must do in Vegas.
4	I've been here 3 times this year. Every time we visit it's a new experience. My kids have been excited for the Marvel characters. The 4D movie is a lot of fun.
4	When I think wax museum, I think figures that may come alive at any second to grab you and drag you back into their netherworld of wax! Okay, not really but some of these figures are done so well, you just may think you saw one move out of the corner of your eye. Going off of tips that this museum as well as the Venetian are haunted, we came here to take a look. Well, the only spirits that we witnessed were the ones being poured out of a bottle from the bartender at the interior bar. When you enter, you have the chance to have your photo taken with cheesy messages to home signs of your choosing. After Joan Rivers insults your outfit, you may enter the themed rooms. Many props are in place for photo ops. Still a great way to blow an hour in Las Vegas!
5	Madame Tussauds is a great entertainment option for adults and families with older kids.  It is easy to access from The Venetian hotel on the strip.  There were several themed rooms and most of the statues looked very real.  We were pleasantly surprised to find out we could touch and get up close to the figures.  In fact, they provide props to make photos more fun!  We ordered our tickets online and saved about $7 per ticket.  I wouldn't recommend this place for younger kids as it could be little scary and they may not recognize any of the personalities, except for maybe the Hulk!
5	We had the best time fooling around with all the characters and just being silly! I love that you go at your own pace and get to interact up close with ALL the exhibits! The Marvel 4d movie was awesome, just know that you're gonna get wet! A lot! The only thing I was disappointed about was that Thor was not on display  this is definitely a must see attraction and we'll worth the price when you get the tix from tix4tonight
4	We enjoyed it very much. It's not worth the regular price. I would definitely suggest getting tickets from one of the tix4tonight both. It's not worth $29 per person.
5	So much fun! My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday morning and it is filled with entertaining wax figures of Beyonce, Rihanna, Joe Montana, Jenna Jameson and way more. The rooms are divided by category such as Sports, Movie Celebs, Music Stars, TV Hosts, etc. There is a bar inside where you can get Fat Tuesdays and the bartender gave my boyfriend and I a discount for my birthday, I'm guessing. It was not too crowded and you could take as many pictures as you liked without feeling rushed or having to wait for others to be done. There are a few places where Museum staff takes pictures of you. In the beginning, they take a few pictures of you with the Welcome to Las Vegas sign behind you; there is a room to take pictures with Elvis in a convertible; there is a room to take pictures with the Hulk grabbing you; another room which we did not see but saw others' pictures was a room with Michael Jackson leaning forward dancing.For $30, you can get two 5x8 prints and all digital copies of the pictures the staff took of you which is a great deal! Their gift shop is also full of fun goodies that you can take home for your loved ones!
4	This was my first wax museum experience...not just Vegas but any location. I wasn't sure what it would be like once I was actually there but my boyfriend and I had a blast from start to finish! I honestly think the people you're with and how much you put into it make or break the experience. We took so many silly and hilarious photos that we were cracking up the wholllle time! Some of the celebs look better than others. Some are awesome (Johnny Depp was definitely my favorite!) and some are pretty awful but regardless, it was a great time! I like that there are props and that you are able to interact with everything. You are on a self guided tour so the crowd ebbs and flows and there are times lots of people are around you and times you are almost alone. Everyone was polite and took turns going from one statue to the next which made for an enjoyable experience for all of us. Some of the signs were mixed up so it would say one celeb's name...Leonardo DiCaprio for example, but a different celeb would be standing there in that spot and Leo would be on the other side of the room. I don't know if they are moving things around or what but we knew almost everyone without the signs anyway. A couple of things to work on: the Michael Jackson interactive area...I'm not sure how that camera works with the green screen but none of us could figure it out so we missed out on that photo op...as well as another couple that was behind us. Also, the newer statues seem to look better than the older ones...as far as looking like the celebs. Some of them you can tell were done years ago because they are much younger and/or thinner versions of the celebs. I know they cost $300,000 and hours and hours of time to make each statue but it's vegas...you gotta keep up with the times! We loved the photos taken of us as we entered and we actually purchased two of them. They are a great piece of memorabilia. There's a Marvel 3D show. I think this is a guy thing. My boyfriend and a lot of the other men in the theater were cracking up and loving it. I don't really get into the whole 3D thing so it was ok to experience once. I did it for him. He thoroughly enjoyed it. It's up to your taste! Get your tickets at a discounted price! We got ours at one of the ticket booths to the left of the Fashion Show Mall. It took us a couple of hours to get through the whole museum plus the show. We put a lot into our experience. It was well worth it! Have fun!
4	After visiting the bootleg Hollywood Wax Museum, Madame Tussauds was a treat, and lots of fun.  The quality of the wax figures was wonderful.  We purchased half price tickets for  $16, which was a deal because regular admission is $29.  We walked through the museum and saw many familiar faces.  Some of my favorites included Beyonce, Will Smith, Leonardo DiCaprio and a couple more.  I was amazed at how many were actually identical to the actual celebrity.  Some were better than others because the Halle Berry statue didn't look that much like her. Once we got to the end of the museum they had us go into a theater and watch some 3D superhero movie with special effects.  I could have done without the movie, but overall the museum was cool. I'm not sure I woud want to pay $29 to enter, so half price tickets are always a smart idea.
4	This place was so much fun! I think some of the waxes look so real and some not so much. My sister in law gave us tickets to go here and I do admit that seeing the wax celebrities and taking photos with them was a fun experience. You get to see the celebs actual height and see videos on how they were made was cool as well. They have movie, sports, tv shows, avengers and music celebs. At the end you get to ride a 3d/4d movie screen which was really fun!
5	I love this place! I agree it is not for everybody - you have to enjoy posing for pictures, for one. But even my husband, who gets super annoyed with pictures, enjoys it. Its dumb and yes, no one is real... but they are all scaled realistically, so even that is cool to see how short/tall/small the celebrities are (and no, I'm not really one of those people who reads about celebrities or really cares about all of that stuff). I love that you can use different props and touch/interact with the figures. It also seems that they are always adding new figures and changing around their settings to do special exhibits. All the figures seems pretty well kept up and none of them seem old/dirty even if it is clear they have been around for awhile (such as Cameron Diaz who no one has cared about for years - so clearly she was made quite awhile ago, but still looks great!). You can always get cheap tickets for it at Tix4Tonight when you are buying other tickets so that you get a discount. There is definitely no reason to pay full price. I've also learned that you probably should not drag people along who have no interest. Luckily everyone that we made go was having fun taking pictures and I think everyone had a good time. However, if you don't see the point of this and think it will be absolutely stupid - just don't go! You won't have fun. I think its a great way to walk off a giant breakfast (very close to Hash House A Go Go, just sayin') and have a little fun.
3	Madame Tussauds is a quintessential Vegas activity.  It was fun to see the wax figures of celebrities and you can go through the exhibits as slowly or quickly as you want.  We really only came here because we saw that there was a Marvel Superhero exhibit- and my sone is crazy into all the superheroes these days.  I had read online somewhere that ages 4 and under were free.  That wasn't true and we ended up having to pay 20.00 for his ticket (Strike one).  The superhero exhibit really only had 3 figures- spiderman, hulk, and the girl from fantastic four.  Only the lady was a wax figure.  The other 2 were just plastic figures (strike 2).  They do however include a 4-D movie which features additional heroes- that my son absolutely loved (one star earned back).  I bought a small snow globe ornament in the gift shop.  The cashier wrapped it in tissue paper but by the time we got back to the hotel, the ornament was completely broken and water was all over the place.  Very disappointing (Strike 2- again).
4	I always enjoy going to the wax museum. I like how they change the celebrities out from time to time. I also like how they are making it more interactive for visitors. This is not a place that you have to keep coming to though, once you have been a time or two that 's enough.I bought a Groupon for $19, as I would d never pay full price to go inside.
4	The hubby and I stopped by Madame Tussauds wax museum while in Vegas and enjoyed ourselves.  I really wanted to give it 3.5 stars but bumped up to the 4 since the half point isn't an option.They had quite a bit of celebrity wax figures for you to have fun and pose with for pictures.  I had high hopes but was a little disappointed in the variety of wax figures they had.  My hubby on the other hand was actually impressed with the selection since he didn't have high hopes to begin with.  His favorites were Joe Montana, Tiger Woods, Snoop Dogg, Tupac, and most of the Marvel comic book characters.
5	My boyfriend and I came here after purchasing a Groupon deal, ($38/2 people that included the admission fee and we received 1 free drink per person). The wax museum was great, they are so life like. The complimentary drink was a blueberry slushy with a weak shot of some kind of well brand alcohol. I went once and everyone visiting Vegas should stop by for a visit, but once is enough, for me!!!
5	So much fun! We had the best time messing around with all the characters and just being silly! This is my 2nd time here. There are several rooms, the celebrities, sports, tv shows etc. The wax figures are incredibly lifelike. The artistry involved in each character is absolutely amazing. We found it interesting to see the size of the celebrities - some taller and some shorter than we expected. Look for the props that are available in most rooms like guitars, hats etc.  I love that you go at your own pace and get to interact up close with ALL the exhibits! The Marvel 4d movie was awesome, they did not have it last year when I went. We spent almost 2hrs but it can be done in 30mins.
3	Not going to lie, I think there's something freaky about these wax figures. Do they look real? Somewhat. But I think that's what makes them freaky. I came years ago and I think my fav figure was Hugh Hefner. It's probably worth going once and that's about it. Next to the venetian. Very touristy.
5	We just visited yesterday the 21st. This was by far one of my favorite stops from our weekend trip to Vegas. I purchased a Groupon for $38 for 2 people online. It came with 2 free drinks but I sadly just realized we never got our free drinks. I had so much fun seeing all the different celebrities and getting our pictures with them. Making funny faces and using all kinds of different props was beyond cool. What also helped is how fun the people around you are too. We really had a good group of people and seeing them and ourselves doing silly, funny and perverted things was just absolutely hilarious!Get your pictures done in the beginning! We had a funny prop and took 3 really great pictures that we purchased at the end. The 4D movie at the end was 10 minutes in length was one of the coolest things ever! Would hate to spoil it but make sure you check it out! The gift shop at the end was really nice and not over priced in my book.This is for sure one stop you have to make while in Vegas!FYI: Getting there is confusing..... hint: Park in the Venetian hotel's self parking and walk to the front of the building. You will see what looks like a clock tower. Its over there and you take an escalator to the front of the business.
3	Have been to Vegas countless times and have walked pass Madam Toussards time after time. During my most recent trip (Christmas vacation) I decided to take my family there. Once inside to my surprise there were a lot of people roaming around taking pictures with the celebrity wax figures. I must say the wax figures were all pretty well done and realistic looking. There were a few times (with so many people in the room) I literally had problems differentiating between real people and the wax figures -- it was weird! The ticket included a 4D super hero movie that was alright -- I'm sure my son enjoyed it much more than I did. I'd give this place 4-stars but they didn't have Master Chief (Halo) as advertised. Bummer as I was really looking forward to snapping some pictures with him.
5	We came here kinda late on a Sunday night and it was a great experience. The 2 gentleman that we working the hand waxed area were a blast for my kids. They were laughing the whole time. The staff went above and beyond for us even after I lost our coupons, they called downstairs and let them know we did have the coupons that includes a drink! Thanks for a great time!!
5	If you like to take pictures with celebrities.... that is definitely the place for you!!!The wax figures are soooo real~ The eyes, the hair, the makeup.... thumbs up for all the artists who put in the time & effort to create all these amazing wax figures. I can spend hours there because I can't resist not to take pictures with every celebrity! They have props that you can use to take pictures. So much fun!!There is a 4D theater, the film is about 10 minutes long. It is located at the end of the museum.Right outside the museum there is a gift shop. Yes, more shopping in Vegas!Sometimes they have great promotion price for the tickets.... 55% off!
4	We went on New Year's Day expecting it to be overcrowded and although it was fairly dense, we got in quickly and customer service was friendly.The figures were amazingly realistic and the scenes were creative. We noticed many of the personalities were popular locally, like magicians and entertainers. We didn't see political figures except for former mayor Oscar Goodman.Most visitors were courteous to each wait their turn for photo opp. You must have patience for tourists from other cultures who don't understand the concept of waiting their turn in line, as there are those oblivious to people in front of them.I was surprised to see a bar in the middle of the museum where you could order those slushy tourist hurricane drinks, beer and wine.At the end of the tour there is a 4D experience. There should be some instruction to give people the option to go through the show or bypass it to exit to the gift shop.It would've been nice to have some more information about the exhibit itself or the history of Madame Tussaud. We recommend this attraction and will visit again, but unsure how often they rotate the figures.
3	Not bad had some really good ones some that were ok had new marvel 4D show that's okBut if your a celebrity picture-taker you'll like this they have a haunted version that sounds interesting all n all its ok had fun.
3	The wax figures were super realistic and some of them were a little creepy! We had $8 off coupons from a magazine in our hotel room, but tickets were still expensive. The rooms are all divided up into categories: athletes, TV personalities, musicians, actors, etc. There are also a lot of cool photo opportunities and props for you to use in the pictures.Overall, it's a pretty quick experience. We probably spent the longest amount of time waiting to see the 4D superhero movie. It was neat - about 10 minutes. I wouldn't pay full price for this and I probably wouldn't return on my next Vegas trip.
