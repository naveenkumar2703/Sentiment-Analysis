5	Wow!!! This is the first time I can say I'm truly happy with my nails since I've moved here :) I keep poking myself to make sure I'm not dreaming ;). Husband-wife duo Tony and Tina man up this facility and here are the highlights from my visit:**Nail salon is clean!!! **Salon technicians are friendly and they actually ask you what you want instead of ignoring what you ask for**Awesome foot/leg massage during the spa pedicure**Reasonable prices ($60 spa pedicure/white fill acrylic/gel)Love it! Definitely coming back!
5	Visiting from FL. Found on Yelp. Great place with reasonable rates and very friendly staff. ManiPedi combo was $35
4	I have been wanting to get a Pedi all summer but I kept finding excuses not to go.This past Friday when my friend invited me I was going to give another reason why I'm just too busy to go. Then I thought I've been putting this off all summer, I haven't received one in such a long time, I finally bought some sandals so my feet have to look good and I deserve it! We drove here after work and we were seen right away. I sat in the massage chair while I had my feet worked on and it was fabulous! It's been so long I forgot how great these feel my favorite is when they work the bottom of my feet cause I'm ticklish! I felt rejuvenated after and it seriously made me think I should get this done more often.
4	I have been going to this shop for a little over a year. I have not been in in a couple months and to my surprise the shop has changed ownership.  I actually loved the previous ownership, but I am willing to give this a try :) So I go in for a pedicure because I had a date on Friday night and I wanted to have pretty toes.  They were very accomodating, worked me in last minute. I enjoyed sitting in the "chair"  It has a back massager and a foot jacuzzi ... it deserves like a special name... like Larry or something.  I loved the pampering- scrubbing my feet and making them new...  I really enjoyed myself.and had pretty toes and heels to boot.I will be back definitely .
5	This is my absolute favorite nail salon! The new owner Van has been doing my nails for a little over two years now and I will go to no one else. When he told me that he would be moving locations; myself along with many of my friends went with him. Don't get me wrong everyone that works there is friendly and each customer I've seen leaves satisfied; but Van is my favorite. Even though Valle Verde & the 215 is a lengthy drive for some it is definitly well worth the trip. Take it from me; I live in North Las Vegas (Cheyenne & Allen to be exact) but I always make my appointment every two weeks. I only see one negative review; but there are always going to be people that will never be satisfied sadly. Hope this was helpful! (:
4	Love this place. Everyone is nice and my nails are always done right
5	Great nail salon.  Hannah is awesome.  Best pedicure I ever got.  Service is wonderful and they do a beautiful job for a great price.
4	First time here today and it was great...a little bit of a wait, but I didn't have an appt so that's ok!  Had a pedicure with Kim - she was friendly and did a fantastic job.  I'll definitely be back!  :)
4	I decided to try this place after reading reviews on Yelp. The service was great. They make sure to pay attention to little things, like calling you by name after you sign in. I love that they don't try and do manicures and pedicures at the same time in an effort to rush you through
5	I decided to try this place out after reading reviews and Im so impressed! I walked in on a Saturday, so they were pretty busy. I waited for maybe 15 minutes, which was fine. Van, the owner, made sure to keep letting me know he hadnt forgotten about me and that I would be seated soon. He also ended up doing my nails. Very friendly and very detail-oriented. I was asked questions about what I wanted that I had never been asked before, which led to the nails Ive always wanted. He made sure to call me by name, which was a great touch. The other customers seemed happy and relaxed, something I take as a very good sign. The prices are in line with the rest of the valley, with a white-tip full set being $30 (fills are $20). Ill definitely be going back!!
5	Nails R Us is great! I went here today, I am on vacation and in need of a pedicure. I went here based on other Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. Hannah was great. Very friendly and my toes look incredible. Everyone was so nice. I really liked that they didn't try to upsell me during the visit - very relaxing and different from other similar types of places. I will be back.
5	Where do I start?!Well my friend's sister wanted to get her nails done and as a treat she treated me and my friend who is her sister,as well. I'm usually extremely picky and don't like trying out other places ,but I went with what other yelper says so i tried this place out and boy did it not disappoint. I read reviews on a nail technician by the name of Van and by all the positive reviews I booked my appointment with him. My friend's sister had his wife and friend had another lady......so let me tell you what happened:We went in and my friend's sister has a tattoo of a coy fish on her wrist and was dead set on getting a coyfish painted on her nails. When we asked if they could do it the lady, that she would later have, said no they could not because it was something they never did before. Well that did it for her, she refused to get her nails done!!!! My friend was already in the chair and I had made an appt.....so after convincing her, I politely ask the lady if she could atleast do the outline to make my friend happy and that when Van called me back. He is a phenomenal nail tech he asked me things like "where did I want the nail place?" and "do i like them think and thin?" I never was asked those questions before then he told me that they were my nails and I should tell him what I like! WOW i was impressed he was so understanding and kind and my nails look adorable! My friend got her nails done into some halloween design, I did short french tips with glitter and i look over at my friend sister and the lady was actually able to PAINT A COYFISH on her nails they looked so pretty i was impressed!!!!!! Needless to say I will recommend all my friends here and come back even though this place is 30 mins away from my house.
5	I love this nail salon so much, I pass up 10 other nail salons to come here. I have extremely sensitive skin and don't enjoy getting my nails done so much. I've been to numerous places and I have to say that Van does the best acrylics I have ever had and is super gentle so it is worth calling and making an appointment with him for that. I have had fills, manicures, and pedicures by all the nail technicians in this shop and they are all great.
5	Since moving to Henderson last June it has been my mission to find a great nail salon. A mission that was a complete failure until recently. I was introduced to the fabulous Van! He not only does a beautiful job, but when you make an appointment he is always ready for you on time! And it only takes about 45 - 60 minutes. EVERYTHING I look for in a good set of nails. The salon is clean and relaxing. There is always something good in the TV (like food network)! to zone out to. I love this place!
5	Got pink and white acrylic nails for valentines night. Van is the co owner with his wife. He is good at taking directions and is an excellent communicator. He is also willing to work with first time customers on the price of their nails I have found. He is technically sound, does wonderful quality nails....but he lacks in the creativity department. I'd say, get your basic nails done here for a reasonable price and have the art work done else where. Great Pedicures!
2	So in the year I've been going to Nails R Us, the experience has gone from great to "time to look for a new nail place". It's gotten increasingly busy, which, as a small business, I can't begrudge them for. However, they've hired more techs to deal with the increase in clientele. The new techs have not been good, at all. If you are lucky enough to have Van or his wife do your nails, they are distracted with supervising all the techs, answering phones, etc. I've since found a new salon (through Yelp, yay!) and am much happier there.
3	I chose this salon based on location and the other reviews and was not disappointed. I arrived at 2pm in a Thursday afternoon without an appointment and was seated right away. The tech offered an upgrade for a deluxe pedicure and I accepted. The upgrade included a sea salt/sugar scrub for the feet and legs, a mentholated foot mask and hot towel wrap plus an extra ten minute massage all for $10 - totally worth it! The ambiance in the salon was relaxing and they offer cold bottled water, a huge plus when its 105 degrees outside.I would have given 4 stars but its been less than 2 days and I already have a chip in the polish on my big toe. Next time I will ask for 2 top coats but I will definitely go back
5	U want it fast... you want it now!!!!   come here!
5	This is the best nail salon I have ever been to. When I call, Hayley can recognize my voice over the phone! Awesome staff. Hayley is my absolute go to girl, she does liquid gel for me that lasts foreverrr. I am a bartender, I crochet, and am very active with my hands. Most nails would give up after a couple days, but mine NEVER break or chip. The prices are right, and they are ALWAYS busy. ALWAYS. Some other people have taken a star away for that, Ive never heard anything so insane in my life. They are busy because they are EPICALLY AWESOME!!!
5	We are traveling full time and it was time for my nails to get done.  I relied upon Yelp reviews to find a nail salon in the area and was not disappointed.  The salon was clean, the techs were helpful and did a great job.  Thumbs up all the way.Patty
4	I have been going to this salon for pedi's for about a year,it is clean they open fresh packs of tools in front of you, I like that.It all depends on who you get.I was just in on Sunday got the delux pedi,2minute massage sucked.but most of the time it is great.Clean is what I look for and I have been happy with this salon.
4	I really am totally enamored with this place. It's clean, convenient and very professional. Mai is the go-to girl for me. She does my nails right every single time. They last, they're beautifully done and she takes her time. Also: $50 for mani/pedi. That's the cheapest I've found in Vegas, and believe me, I've looked. Every time I've made an appointment I've gotten right in and out. Mai is a total professional, she talks to you, has a sweet disposition and never, ever talks in front of you in another language with the other techs. That alone is worth everything to me. Courtesy, courtesy, courtesy. The reason I gave this place four stars instead of five is because the two times before this time that I've gone I've used my own polish and it's been returned open and has spilled in my (Louis Vuitton) purse. I mean, I don't want polish in ANY purse, but I certainly don't want it in this one. I tighten it myself now, but I really shouldn't have to. Other than that, this place is amazing. I've been back consistently which is rare for me. I never can find a nail place I love, but I have now!
2	Had a deluxe pedi and gelpolish mani.The pedi I would give 5* and the mani only 1*.It all started when I came in and asked for a full set of gels with a french inspired design.  The girl who wanted to help me just didn't speak nor understood enough english to know what I meant.  She was getting annoyed and kept telling me 'you pick gel color' while pushing the color chart under my nose.  My husband dropped me off, so I couldn't just leave :(So I picked a color and asked what designs she could do.  Her answer was simple: 'none'.  She told me my nails were to short for a french inspired design... aaarrgh.Ok, I really needed my nails done, so I went with plain red and asked for white polka dots.The girls who did my nails smothered the gel polish all over my cuticles and left it like that.  Off course, that's a mani that wasn't meant to last.The pedi on the other hand  was delightful
3	Friendly staff, and nice work. I wish they had more nail designs to choose from and more of a massage for the pedicure. This place was okay but nothing to write home about.
3	The place is nice, big and clean looking.  I like when they open the sterile bags in front of you and the lady I had didn't do this.  So it made me kinda nervous that everything was clean.  She must've been new because the other lady was telling her things she missed.  I was reading my magazine not really paying attention and she ended up painting my nails a different color than I picked out.  I have no idea where she got the other color when the color I picked was sitting right next to me.  Paint job was just ok.  I was visiting from out of town so I may give it another try when I'm back here visiting but my experience today was nothing better than just ok.
5	I don't live in the area (I actually live in CAlifornia) but I was visiting for my cousin's wedding. My cousin's future wife recommended this place and after amazing yelp reviews I decided to ask for Mai. She did a PHENOMINAL job and I have to say she also warmed my heart/made me cry.Mai decided to cut all of her hair off herself to donate to a charity because her mom is sick. I admire her so much for coming in the next day and not caring what anyone thought. I actually thought it was a VERY cute look on her. Long story short, Mai is amazing and so is this spot. So if you live locally please check them out. I know I'll visit Mai next time I'm in town
2	I thought I had found my go-to nail salon in Vegas, after moving from the OC in July 2012. Unfortunately, My or Mai totally ruined it for me. I've been a consistent and loyal customer for about 6 months. The second to last time I was there, I came in for a gel mani and spa pedi. I was on a time crunch and asked if I could do both or if I should just do one service that day and come back the next day. They said they could do both. Turns out they werent even paying attention to the time and I walked out with only a pedi and naked nails (because they already removed the gel). I paid in advance for the service because take off is cheaper with a new set. I wasn't trippin that I'd have to come back the next day. I just wish they were more realistic and honest. No biggie. I thought I'd give them another chance. Then I came in last week. Mai or My did my nails. Shes the one with a shaved head. Totally unprofessional! She was rude and started to give me an attitude when I asked for her not to do anything to my cuticles. I had gel on but decided to just get a regular manicure because I noticed my nails were becoming sensitive so I wanted to give them a rest. She used a DRILL the whole time instead of soaking them. THEN she cut me with the drill TWO times! So careless!! Then when it got to actually painting my nails, she had difficulty understanding what I wanted and started acting irritated. Just so I could get through the language barrier, I showed her a picture of what I wanted. I wanted my nails filed with the stiletto style and she started filing them into a square! Luckily, the woman owner was able to do my nails perfectly fine. Even then, I probably will look for another salon now...
4	Katie did a good job on my gel manicure.  The only thing missing was a hand massage with lotion.  No hand lotion at all during the entire manicure.  Lana gave my husband both manicure and pedicure.  She was personable and effective. We will go back.
1	I hate this place!!!!!!!!!!! First I wait 20 mins and when I try to ask the lady how long they ignore me as if I don't exist? Are you kidding me!!!!!!!!! So unprofessional!!!! and they weren't even busy!!! You will never get my business or any of my friends from now on!!!!!! don't forget without customers you wouldn't exist!!! And when I told my friend about it she said it wasn't worth it anyways!!!! Apparently bad service and customer service!!! Never will get my business
4	Great service. I had an appointment and even though it was busy I was helped with in 5 minutes of walking in. My nails look great. Not sure who I had as a stylist but they were very professional Andy did an amazing job.
2	My dad is pretty cool - first thing after breakfast when he arrived this weekend was decide to hang out together - he suggested getting manicures.  My mom has gotten my dad into this and he had some nice nails - they just needed a trim/file/buff.  He pulled up the yelp app while I was driving - this place was close and had 4 stars from lots of reviews.It was busy - a good sign - and it was a Saturday late morning, so the crowd was to be expected.  We were both told to sign in on a clipboard.  Two ladies came in after us, and did not sign in until later, but were both taken ahead of us.Then I was called before my dad though he signed up first.  The owner (a male) removed my polish and started taking calls and filling out appointments on a computer next to the table.  Then he pointed at a lady and pointed to me, and she took over.  A few minutes later, my dad was called to a woman to do his manicure.  The manicure cost was $12 - for me that included from beginning to end, file, buff, polish...but my dad was told he could only get clipped for $12 and had to pay $5 more for a buff!  He declined.My dad started after me but was finished BEFORE my polish was on - if we had the same steps up to that point he should have still had some nice treatment.  He showed me his nails - they were BUTCHERED!  They were clipped crazily and jagged, not filed at ALL, and no longer nice flat and shiny like they were when he arrived.  He was very upset - the lady had chopped the EDGES of his nails very deep and it was so uneven it was shocking.  He talked to the owner and showed him his nails - and his "manicure" was so quick and without filing or buffing, it was crazy.  He could do it better!First, he was told to go back to his lady and she started clipping off more!  He jumped up and told her to stop.  The owner then spent more time with my dad than his original person, shaping and filing and buffing for no extra charge.  This is why I added a star.  My technician was nice and from far away my nails look fine, but there are giant bubbles in the polish on my fingers, which I never have seen, even when I do my own nails.  Even though it is cheap, we felt rushed and my dad was given weird pricing and such a horrific experience that I felt so bad about the start to his trip here.I can do my own nails better so I will not return.UPDATE: A week has gone by and I decided to remove the bubbled nail polish since I need to redo my nails.  Even though it is a polish color I own and I did not do gel nails, the topcoat on me will not allow me to remove the polish with nail polish remover after a lot of work and remover used...beware!
4	Green Valley ladies (and dudes), I declare this the best Henderson nail salon for the following reasons:1.  Always packed and adequately staffed.  I counted 14 nail technicians one Saturday and the salon was packed.  Busy is a good sign.2.  Foot grater.  Not every nail salon uses this cheese-grater looking device.  Totally gross what it takes off (dried skin, ew) but worth it.3.  They open a new tool pack with every pedicure. No toenail-disease producing instruments here!Oh, and they also do a good job at a reasonable price.  Good Green Valley spot.
5	Its been almost 5 years since my initial review of this salon and I can say this has been a long lasting and loving relationship. I have been going to Kim for manicures and pedicures for about 3 years now and even though this salon is a good trek from my side of town it is more than worth the drive. Kim is an awesome and talented nail tech and the most fabulous thing about her is that she loves her clients and is more than happy to accommodate their requests. I always leave the salon happy.The salon has a huge selection of gel and hard gel colors and glitters. I was a pink & white girl for years and finally made the switch to gel. It might not be for everyone but it's the best thing I ever did for my nails. Gel manicures run around $30 (add a little extra for hard gel) and pedicures $50 (add a little extra for hard gel).I highly recommend making an appointment as the salon does stay pretty busy!
5	It's the 4th of July and I really needed and wanted a pedi but nobody was open. I'm thinking the festivities happen around 5 or 6 so a nail shop should at least be open half a day or until maybe 4pm?... I finally found one and I called them at 2pm hoping that they didn't take off this early and they would still be open and sure enough they were. I asked if I can get a pedi now and she said they close at 3 today but if I come now, I'll get right in. I practically hung up on her trying to race out the door and 10 minutes later I was there. I signed in, picked my color and I was told to go and sit at the chair where the water was running. She, and I think her name was Maya or Amaya, asked if I wanted the deluxe for 10 bucks. She explained the difference and that I would get an extra massage too. I was totally sold! Not only did Amaya do a fabulous job with my feet she also gave me THE BEST MESSAGE EVER. I was so happy with their atmosphere, hospitality and the deluxe pedi that I will always go back just to have her and relax with her awesome hands working on my feet. And one last thing, how smart were they to be open today. VERY! It was jam packed with other idiots like me trying to get something done on a holiday...... LOL!
2	I decided to come here since the places near my house are just ok. Lets just say I should have just went to a place near my house. This place was defiantly just ok. The place looks really nice and clean, which I like. The male nail tech that worked on me seemed very grumpy and I would say didn't do the best job and didn't care to do the best job either. I am 8 months pregnant and wanted to treat my poor feet to nice pedicure and it was just ok. I was disappointed. The only time he seemed nice was when I tipped him. I think I would have enjoyed myself with another nail tech more. It's a shame.
2	I have gone to this nail shop for about a year and have routinely had average service.  However, my last two visits have pushed me into the "not going back there" category. During my second to last visit I watched an employee dig into a pouch buried at the bottom of her supply caddie and pull out a callus razor. Callus razors are illegal in NV (and most states) because they can cause serious skin damage and can carry blood born infections from person to person.  I am assuming since this razor was hidden in a separate pouch from the other tools which appeared to be sterilized this razor is not properly cleaned between illegal uses. The last visit, which is the one that pushed me over the edge, involved a personal hygienic issue with one of the female employees. After I got my pedicure I asked for an eyebrow wax. My technician escorted me into the waxing room and said she would be right back. I then watched her go to the back sink directly across from where i was sitting and blow her nose into her hands. She then rinsed her hands off (without soap) and came back to wax my eyebrows. Yuck!  Thanks but no thanks!  With a nail salon on every corner, I will happily go somewhere else.
3	Clean & nice facility , they do a good job here :-)
3	I go here quite often due to how close it is to my house and how great the prices are, but the quality is not so great and i have found many places that do manicure, pedicures, full sets, etc. for a similar price but better quality. If you need a quick mani & pedi this is the place to go, but if you want beautiful nails, go somewhere else!
4	Overall, the experience was pretty good.  I got a regular mani and pedi for $35.  An up-sale to gel was offered, but there was no pressure to take it.  Staff was efficient, but could be abrupt due to the language barrier.  The main detraction from this place is when you enter.  You smell the fumes, and they are potent, so if that matters to you (whether you are sensitive to smells, pregnant, etc), you may want to pass. Also, it would be helpful to have a dedicated cashier.  Overall, this place is efficient, inexpensive, and provides a decent mani/pedi/
1	Updated review: the past few times I've come here the lady doing my pedi talks in Vietnamese the whole time..each time it's been a different lady too. This is so rude and not relaxing..they talk and laugh and clearly they are gossiping. Um hello I'm here to relax not listen to your annoying language in gossip tones! I won't be back..ever.
1	Don't go here..other than one lady_mai- they are all catty gossipy and talk in their language  to each other the entire time
1	I used to like this place but the last few times I've come the service has been very non-relaxing. I get a deluxe pedi , however, the whole thing is rushed and the massage sucks. And the girl working on me (which has been a few different girls) always talk to the other women working there, very loud, in their language the whole time. The conversation has lots of cackling and rude stares in my direction. Thought we were past the point of this behavior in nail salons but I guess not. Needless to say, I will not go back here ever again. $80 for my daughter and I to leave feeling rushed and talked about. No thank you!
5	Unlike a lot of these people complaining, I have ALL GOOD THINGS to say about Van! He is absolutely amazing and very nice! I applaud him for not dealing with BS from customers! Some people complain just to get something free out of it! When I first came to Van, like seriously, 3 years ago, he specifically asked me how I wanted my nails. Short? Long? Thin? Thick? Flare? Natural?He is so gentle and unlike other nail salons I had been to, Van has never made me bleed! I feel sooo relaxed when he is doing my nails. If you get your nails done by someone else, and you don't like it, be sincere with Van. He will do what he can to make it better. I only make my appointments with him!
4	Very good experience we will be returning. We arrived shortly before they were closing they stayed open late to service us and did not rush. Only negatives are the massage chairs do not work well and add on services are pricey.
1	Came in and they were really nice I brought my own crystals I wanted to put on my nails they didn't do them how I wanted called and let them know I was going to come in the next day to get them removed being they put gel on top and glue which wasn't what I asked for!! I walked in the next day and I'm told by I'm thinking the owner they are to busy to help me very rudely! Sad they don't have good customer service !
5	Fantastic!!! And Vivian is my favorite!!!!! Love that place.
1	This was the worst nail salon experience I've ever had.  It's been months since I had my first and only visit here.  After my experience, I took the time to write some notes so that when I finally got around to it I could have these details for my review.  So here it is:I saw "Crystal" I believe her name was.  Up to this point I'd had gel on my nails constantly for months so I wanted regular polish to give my nails a break.  Listen, when I go somewhere to pay for a service, I know what I want.  I don't need anyone to try and up-sell me over and over again.  So her constant questioning me, "You don't want gel?" "You sure you don't want gel?" was flipping annoying.    The pedicure turned out fine although the massage was barely there. The manicure on the other hand was a disaster in the making.  Normally when techs remove your gel polish, they let it sit for 10 minutes so the acetone soaks in and softens up the old gel polish so it can be scraped off w/o damage to the nail bed.  This gal "Crystal" lets my fingertips sit in a bowl for barely 10 seconds and then proceeds to use a Dremel sanding tool on me, sanding off the layers of old gel polish. I didn't realize at the time the damage she was doing.  There were points where it felt "hot" on my nails, and I knew she was going at it too harsh but I didn't say anything because I thought this was a new technique or something (after all, she's the "professional", right?).  I didn't imagine she was actually damaging me and SANDING OFF LAYERS OF MY NAILS!Well, needless to say the end result was rough, uneven, lumpy, full-of-grooves, thinned nails!!!  Which of course means weaker nails that split and crack.  Which is exactly what happened for the next course of months as I had to let them grow out.  She even tried to cheat me out of 2 coats of regular nail polish, since she wasn't pulling in the "big" money with a gel mani.  "There look, only 1 coat is okay!".  I said, "Seriously?  No, I want two coats".  Who does that?!??!!Never again will I go there, and never again will I second guess myself when a technician pulls one of those Dremel sanders out.
5	I love this nail salon! It is so clean! The owner Van is constantly cleaning, and I've seen all the staff doing their part as we'll. I've been going here for a long time, and I have no complaints. I see Hannah every time I go for a gel manicure. I go for the awesome pedicures as well. I been to many of the other ladies and they are all great! If I ever have a broken nail, I go in and it's never a problem, they just fix it. It's nice to go to a nail salon that is so clean, everyone is smiling to greet you, and professional.
5	I have been going to this nail salon for over two years and Hayley is my nail tech. She does a fantastic job on my nails! They have a wide selection of OPI polish (I'll only use OPI polish) and glitter acrylic, which I like to do from time to time. The salon is very clean and the decor is upscale and relaxing. I've gotten my pedicures done there as well by a variety of techs and have never been disappointed.
1	I was referred to this location by a couple of my friends that swear by this place.  I decided to do something really nice for my significant other for his birthday back in October.  After purchasing this gift certificate my significant other was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer and has not felt well enough to go get a manicure until today.  This would be his first manicure ever, but upon calling to set up an appointment, he was told "Too bad, it expired".  He is such a nice guy that he was ok with it and told me he was sorry but could not use the G.C.  I was so upset that I contacted the owner who informed me that he did not care, my bf should have said he was battling brain cancer and he would only accept half of the value of the gift card.  To me this really suck because when you purchase a G.C. this is as good as cash or treated as equal to it.  I do not think he should have to say by the way I have stage 4 brain cancer, can you please make an acception, but seriously to claim that all of their gift cards only have a 3 month "shelf life" is HORRIBLE!!  I did check with my friends who do visit this location did have G.C. which all had 6 month or more expiration dates on it.  The owner even talked to me like I was a complete idiot and told that I should learn what date it actually is right now because it has been longer than 3 months.
2	Gone here about 4-5 times, it's a good enough salon to use as a last resort. Don't recommend getting french gel nails since you will walk out with bubbles in them. They are quick and easy to get into, just can't stand the unprofessionalism shown throughout the women.
1	I felt ripped off $55 for manicure pedicure for a man is the most I've ever paid in my life. I agreed to pay electric $10 for a foot mask and lotions but I did not feel I got what I paid for with the lotions. However I did get lotion. Where I felt I got ripped off, is when they added $10 to use one of those chemical buffers to do my nails.
3	It is all about the technician you get to whether your experience is good.  I got Katie last time and again a poor quality manicure and pedicure.  My husband has a girl he likes and he is very very picky.  I see some of the comments on up selling but just be firm on what you are getting. All in all I like the look and feel of the salon but will never us Katie again.
1	Still can only rate them a 1 start instead of 0 stars, called to see if i can get my money back from the gift certificate because my spouse has since died of brain cancer and I feel this company stole the money since they never allowed him to use it.  He told me that i needed to stop talking and listen to him and i could do what ever i wanted to try to get my money back but he will never refund a gift certificate.  He told me I could use the gift certificate if i wanted but he will not refund money ever to anyone.  I told him that was possibly illegal and he told me he did not care, told me he was recording the conversation, which I replied, "Good" and then he hung up on me.  TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
5	Here from out of town and very happy with my pedicure and set of nails. The salon was clean and Rosie was very nice.  Next trip here I will definitely come back! Brought my granddaughter with me for a pedicure and manicure and she was happy!
5	Hayley does a fabulous job on my nails! I would recommend her anytime. Crystal has the gentlest touch on your feet, and they never fail to feel and look fantastic when she gets finished. If your looking for a mani, pedi, acrylic, or gel salon, then this is the place to go!
