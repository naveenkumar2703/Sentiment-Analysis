4	UPDATE:  I hate to take away a star, but they've since lost a star in my book due to inconsistancy with offerings.  What they consider their best sellers and best desserts they don't even carry all the time.  Boo.It's rare to find a patisserie that I can rave about, especially because I do a lot of my own desserts at home.What I look for in a good dessert:If it's a rich dessert, it should be thick and moist or indulgently creamy.  Eating a rich dessert should make you feel sexy and naughty, like stealing a peek at a hot guy across the way to find he's looking at you too.If it's a light dessert, it should be just sweet enough to invite you in bite after bite.  It shouldn't make you feel guilty, but it should satisfy a sweet tooth at the same time.Arai has both for the taking.Conveniently next to Fujiya, a cute little Japanese market, this bakery has a small selection of desserts, but what they do create, they do well.The Green Tea Mousse is to die for, resuscitate, and die for again!  The light pillowy mousse has just enough hint of green tea to let you know what you're eating, and isn't so sweet you feel like you just invested in grills made out of sugar crystals.  It's pretty much the only thing I order there, although I've tried the fruit tart as well (delish too!) and I've heard the blueberry mousse is great, but they seem to run out when I get out there.  On top of the desserts, they offer fresh breads and cakes to order.The staff is friendly, which is always a plus.I can't wait to get back there to try their other offerings!
4	This is as close to an Andersen (Japanese) Bakery (Google it...) as we are gonna get here in the PHX area...I almost always make a trip right next door to this bakery when I make my bi-weekly visit to Fujiya, the Japanese grocery store next door....The only reason I give it a 4 star as opposed to a 5 star is because as many times as I have been there...the dude (younger cat) who usually waits on me is still as robotic as ever. Always the same expression, never a smile, just take my order, get my stuff, give me my change, thanks and bounce! I don't expect to be treated as warmly as Norm on CHEERS but damn I've been there a million times...sigh....oh well, on to the guts of the review....Arai has great authentic Japanese deserts and breads...Azuki (sweet red bean) An-Pan buns as well as Creme-Pan (custard), Melon Pan and Hot dog-Pan (I think that's what its called, LOL!). They sell freshly baked Japanese bread, which is that tall extra moist and yeasty sweet bread as well as assorted crispy cookies!In the case there are different mousses, strawberry layer sponge cake (my fav, see pics), creme puffs and fruit tarts! They also sell dainty premade sandwiches (think afternoon tea selection) as well as made to order tuna and chicken sandwiches on their wonderful breads! They also sell custom cakes (that are delicious by the way) and you can see examples of their work on the right hand wall as well as look through a picture book they have...in fact a couple of my own Hello Kitty themed birthday cakes are in there!  ;)  (THE CAKES ARE EXPENSIVE)Prices for everything are a wee bit on the pricier side but considering everything's handmade, it balances it out....TIP: They sell a cup of refreshing iced green tea thats only .99 cents and its made with real matcha! (not ice cream but iced green tea)
2	The desserts are a little bland and are pricey given the small size.  I've had better Japanese bakery items elsewhere.
4	I was a brat to think that I'll be deprived of Japanese pastries and baked goods in AZ.  Of course, it is not the same compared to L.A. Japanese Bakeries but Arai Pastry is more than what I expected.  *Selection = not as many BUT they are all pretty good.*Quality =  spongy is better than mousse (it is surprising because I usually like mousse way more)*Bread Loaf = Amazing! Very spongy (fuwa fuwa) and freshly baked.*Service = Polite and attentive*Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich = Yummy*Green tea smoothie = GOOD :)
4	Yummy Japanese desserts. I just wish there was more of a selection. I've been here about 4-5 times and each time they have the normal 5-6 offerings. Not sure why they don't have more a variety, I think the majority of their business is from special order cakes or something. I really love their cream pan and hot dog pan. The bread is so airy and delicate. I also like their strawberry shortcake. I ordered one of their strawberry shortcakes for my anniversary and loved it, but it was a bit pricey. Next time I'm going to try their Japanese bread loaves, they look so good and soft.
5	With the little amounts of Japanese people in Arizona I am surprised there is a bakery. I am glad there is. I have seen this bakery for year as I frequent the neighboring businesses. On one such occasion I decided to give them a shot and ordered a sandwich and some pastries. I have to say, as good as it gets here in Arizona. From what I can tell they are very consistent and the staff have been here for a very long time so you know they know what they are doing. A hidden gem in the valley!
4	Wacky sandwich! Damn, I love me some wacky sandwich. Backstory: Someone left a Lee's Sandwiches menu on the kitchen counter. It could have been me; I'm really not sure. But I spotted it while making coffee, then spent the next four hours lusting after a ham, head cheese and pate bahn mi. Yes. Ham, head cheese and pate. Fuck you. It's delicious.But it's also in Chandler. I think. Gilbert? Edge of Mesa? I don't really know, but what I do know is that the corner of Dobson and Warner requires that I cross both the 101 and the 60. Both of them. In one trip. I was tired just thinking about it. Instead: Arai Pastry. Japanese sandwiches. Not the same as bahn mi, no, no at all. But it was Euro-Asian goodness, and that's what mattered.Spicy teriyaki chicken topped with a slice of American cheese (wha?), spicy mayo (not "chili aoili," mind you -- Arai is not that kind of place), jalapenos, lettuce and tomato. On a nice big wheat baguette. Spicy. Random. Delicious. And thanks to good ole American ethnocentrism, my stomach is more than happy to lump all Asian sandwiches together under the same umbrella. Hunger solved. Thanks, wacky sandwich!
4	Mexican flan in a Japanese bakery? You bet your sweet little tooth! DELICIOUS. Cannot wait to go back and get the green tea mousse.
4	Ever since I moved to the Tempe area, I've been making occasional appearances whenever I stopped by Fujiya next store.Surprisingly though, I've stopped by twice this week!  Now my wallet [I spent at least $20 each time]and waistline begs me to stop, I'm addicted to their sukiyaki beef sandwiches on fluffy white bread and their miscellaneous selection of adorable and yummy pastries.While I sit here typing this review, my mind is wandering to the green tea mousse, green tea pudding, and the cute cream puff in the fridge.  Yummy!Now if they would just hire me...!
5	Finding [delicious] Japanese bakery goods fresh is hard in AZ - you either find it, or you don't, there's no mid-way point! A friend of mine brought me here, it was my first time and I was looking forwards to it!Upon entering the cute little bakery, it had a very light atmosphere, they have classical music playing, three table sets you can sit at (although I was hoping you could also sit outside to enjoy eating the sweets and the weather) and in the back through a window where they place the finished orders through, you can see the Patisserie making sandwiches or new bakery items! It's really fun when you're waiting for your food! I really love their curry bread ("an-pan" [or "pan"] in Japanese), I had bought a Fraise and it was REALLY good - the cream was "heavy" but also light and sweet, the strawberries were sour, but they complimented the cream nicely along with the strawberry jam and shortcake at the bottom. When we went back the next day they didn't have it - so I'm assuming they keep a rotated bakery menu so you always have to go back to see what new pops up! (Which, in my opinion, is very smart!)Personally, the price for their deserts are set just right because of how high quality they are. I am going back when I have the free time to go again since I still have to try more of their menu!!
4	Went back and got the green tea mousse, I wasn't expecting the cake bottom, or whipped cream middle, but it was pretty delicious.
5	I can't say enough about this bakery, everything is so delicious!  The bread is fresh, soft and light as a cloud in your mouth.  I only wish we had a bakery like this in San Diego.  Each time I go to Phoenix I visit the bakery daily.  The chocolate horns are to die for, the lightly sweet soft horn really blends well with the not overly sweet chocolate filling.  I bring several loaves of bread home with me every visit.  I can't get enough.  If your ever in the area you HAVE to visit this place.
4	We tried the eclair and the strawberry cake there. They are so good!I will definitely come back to buy birthday cake. The dessert is not too sweet and it is authentic Japanese dessert taste. Eating their dessert is definitely not give you guilty feeling at all.. because it is so fresh and light. I will come again to try the green tea mousse cake and the green tea drinks as people recommended here.. hopefully it is as good as what they say.And I heard Ichiro came here when he stays for spring training to get his favorite bread and desserts
3	Over-rated! It's pretty decent bakery but if you get there after lunch not much left. They bake very few qty at a time and I think they only bake stuff once a day cuz they never have enough. They're never busy so I don't know where all of there stuff go cuz I never get I want to eat there.
4	Ordered a strawberry cake here for a party. Everyone liked it and it had a cute frosting puppy decoration on top. The selection of fruit arranged on the cake was also nice. It looked quite fabulous.They sell weeaboo-friendly foods like chocolate coronets, ufo-pan, an-pan, and puddi.
4	I am actually very content with their Japanese desserts. My personal favorite and must have when I'm in the area is the green-tea mouse cake. I've had better in LA but considering I am currently located here and its actually good, it definitely hits the spot when the craving arises for Asian desserts. The people are friendly and willing to explain what is in everything and are very attentive.
4	I wish they had more of a selection, and a lot of times when I go in, they are out of things. Yet, I love this place, almost everything I have bought has been delicious. I try to go here once a week. It's great.
5	The best birthday cake in town! The sandwiches are super delicious! Love this place!
4	Small little bakery serving up light, spongy Japanese style cakes, pastries, and bread.  They also have gourmet jams and jellies such as Meyer lemon marmalade.  The strawberry cake I had was excellent.  It was very light, not too sugary, with slices of fresh strawberry.  I sampled a few other desserts, and liked the green tea mousse the best.  We went here on a Sunday afternoon, and there was a limited selection of dessert, but what they did have was quite tasty.They also have drinks such as iced coffee and shakes that I'd like to try out next time I'm here.  The tiramisu shake sounds intriguing!

5	Delicious! I got the tea sandwiches, strawberry mousse, and chocolate cake here. I am currently eating my way through them all and was so impressed that I decided to put up a yelp review during my lunch break!The mousse is sweet, with a delicious layer of spongy cake underneath, and the tea sandwiches are absolutely perfect to go with a cup of green or black tea.The packaging that my cakes came in was beautiful, and service was very Japanese (which is good!).Next time I am in the area, I will definitely try out the other types of sandwiches.
5	Everything is delicious!! I always could not decide which one to have for the day. If you love bread, this is the place for it. If you love cake, this is the place for it. If you love love sweet/dessert, this is the place for it.At the Masuri Festival, they were so nice....they made the beef teriyaki sandwich for me even though they already started to pack up their stuff to end the festival. Thanks a lot and it was yummy.
5	The raisin bread its to die for.  FUWA FUWA bread time!   Gloriously soft, I could eat the loaf in one sitting.  Also the anpan is airy, light, and delicious as well.  I haven't had a chance to try the deserts, but I swear each slice and cup look absolutely adorable and perfect.
5	Um, what can I say?!? We always stock up on the breads here. My hubby loves the butter white bread. Cut it into thick pieces and just toast. Yum! And we both enjoy the wheat bread.We both love all the selection of their pans, esp the curry, sausage, chocolate, and cream ones. (I do wish they had more selection of breads cuz I think they do them so well!)The desserts - I like the flan, the earl grey cake, and pretty much all of them. I can't remember. We've tried so many. I like to experiment ;)And the mixed sandwich. Nice and refreshing on a warm/hot day. A good snack to satiate the hunger.Try the sukiyaki beef sandwich. Don't forget to ask to toast the bread. SOOO good! I prefer the beef over the chicken. It's juicier. And the cakes! If you've never ordered a cake here, it's a must! For your next special occasion! The whipped cream is not too heavy and sweet, the cake in general is airy and light and perfect on the sweetness (meaning not too sweet like most desserts you eat these days). Filled with different fruits depending on what you order. Just get one and see for urself!A few years ago we ordered a cake and then bunch of different cakes and asked them to cut it into little pieces as desserts/cake for our wedding guests. Everyone LOVED it! (I know... shame on me for not posting till now, but hey, I'm fairly new to yelp ;) ) We love the service here.
5	my absolute FAVORITE! i've tried pretty much everything on the menu, & regardless of what you get, it's always delectable. simply put, anything you get from there is absolute perfection!!

5	I was at the Fujiya Market (which is next door) and saw this place and decided to stop in.The place smells amazing!We got the strawberry cake and a flan.The flan was my absolute favorite. It's not like the traditional mexican flan you are thinking of. They take a smaller version of that and stick it on top of what seems to be a few layers of custard and soft pound cake. They then top it off with fresh strawberries, blueberries and kiwi along with a few dollops of whip cream. It's seriously to die for!!The staff was nice and helpful too...very patient while we tried to figure out what to get!!I'll be coming back here for sure!!
5	Everytime I'm in Tempe I have to stop here.  The white bread is delicious.  The flan is amazing.  The curry-pan (curry filled bread) is almost as good as what you buy in Japan.  The cakes are expensive, but the quality is so much better than what you get at a grocery store.  If you're traveling within 10 miles of this place, do yourself a favor and stop here.  Your stomach will thank you =)
5	I wrote a faux review for a college class on this place. I can't recommend it enough. They make some really fantastic looking cakes but I can't say I've ever had the occasion to pick one up. What I have had, however, is the bread. This place is loads better than the bakery outside the Mekong Market and their curry pan is downright sexy. This is a great place to take someone who has never experienced being in a bakery before (as supermarkets seem to dominate this country, and especially Maricopa county) as the smells began to swirl around your head the moment you walk in.They have items for just over a dollar (little chocolate buns, sweet bean paste trifles and the like) and even make sandwiches for 6 or 7 bucks, which are made in the traditional Japanese style, but didn't impress enough for a second try. A freshly made loaf of bread here is a must. If you grew up eating Aunt Hattie's or Wonderbread your brain might bleed out of your ears after trying something hot from Arai. As a final note, this place is sort of hard to find. You can use the Dunkin Donuts as a land mark to make sure you're in the right place. There is also a hoagie shop and a computer repair/parts store. Good luck!
5	This place is great! Friendly service and gorgeous, tasty baked goods. The green tea flan is amazing as are the sukiyaki beef sandwiches and curry pan. It's hidden but the price is great and this place is heaven for savory dessert lovers!
5	Arai Pastry is, hands down, the best pastry place ever! Their cakes are so fluffy that they melt in your mouth and are really delicious. My husband and I surprise each other with their pastries and those are the best surprises ever. :) Because of Arai, birthdays are eagerly looked forward to in our home.We love the strawberry cake/pastry. Another flavor to die for is kiwi/orange. Plus they decorated most of my cakes with cute sheep made of whipped cream. An added bonus. :)
5	I would highly reccomend trying the UFO bread.  It's basically fluffy bread with a crunchy cookie coating.  You will not be disappointed.  I almost didn't try it because I wasn't sure about the name.  I'm assuming the name comes from the shape if the pastry.  I looks like a flying saucer.  I'd love to go back and try more of their pastries!
5	We found them on Yelp when we needed to order a birthday cake for my daughter's 12th birthday party, AND needed a place that was open later on Saturdays (being open on Sunday was a definite bonus).    My daughter wasn't convinced--she's watched too much Cake Boss and wanted fondant on her cake. (they don't do that)  Short of spending $250 for  cake, we weren't having much luck.  We were going to leave, but decided to try some cake from the display.  WOW!!!  My daughter fell in love with the strawberry cake.  Not only was it light and delicious, they were willing to put on the design my daughter wanted--a My Little Pony character.  They just told us to bring the picture and they would do their best.  Their best was AMAZING!!!  My daughter was overwhelmed, they had done such an awesome job!  Nearly all the kids (and ALL the grownups) at the party loved the cake.  It was very nice to have something light on a hot summer day. I will go here from now on for cake and other yummies!  THANK YOU!!!
2	Oops! Looks like I'm breaking the trend of five-star reviews.This place is okay, but definitely not 5 star-worthy.First, the eats: The pastries, while I'm glad to say are made with decent ingredients (they post them, and there's no soy crap or margarines/hydrogenated oils), they're not very impressive. Their cookies are the hard, crunchy kind which I generally dislike (especially when they look big enough to be the soft kind). The other pastries, like their red bean rolls and things of that nature, are reminiscent of a sweet hot dog bun filled with whatever filling. I will admit I haven't tried any of their cakes, but given that I didn't like the other stuff...Next, they're not too great with customer service; especially ostensible contrast. What I mean by that is that both times I've been in there, I have been preceded by a Japanese customer to whom they were very jovial and nice. Then, here comes the white guy (me) and they're kinda like "eh." They also really oughtta hire a woman to be up front, as the guys there (including the old guy I saw in the back) all seem pretty brooding and preoccupied.I dunno; I get the tendency of people to give 5 star reviews based on the fact a place is locally owned and/or novel (Wow, real Japanese people!). I just feel that in this case, it's hype.
2	I have ate here quite a few times for lunch since their bread is so soft and delicious, especially love the teriyaki sandwich. They also have pretty decent pastries from the ones I have tasted. The two brothers that work the front counter are ok to work with, one is more personable than the other. Now my complaint is not over the service or the pastries but more specifically, a wedding cake I recently ordered. I went with my fiance to look at some options and they had only a few pictures of some decent wedding cakes. We wanted to see more examples but didn't really have any and practically insisted on us bringing in a picture of one to make identical. Now this is where it got interesting, the cake I gave them a picture of was white frosted with black icing design and red flowers. They let me know the red may not come out that dark which I was fine with. Turns out they couldn't even give me black but dark brown instead. So I have a dark brown and medium pink decorated cake and that's not even the worse part. The fact that it looked nothing like the picture I provided them and would barely be passable at a child's b-day party, but certainly not a wedding. I'm just glad I didn't select the next level (3-tier) one that would have required them to bring it out and have to pay substantially more money, which this one was expensive enough as it was. The cakes was just so simplistic, not anywhere near wedding caliber, tiny for a wedding cake due to probably portion sizing for Japanese vs Americans I'm thinking. This size claimed to serve 30-40 but more like 25 at most if everyone has a small slice. Anyways, I ended up not taking the cake but only the mini cakes I ordered to go with it and let them keep the whole deposit, even though it was twice as much as the mini cakes should have costed but thought it'd be nice to compensate them a little for their time. From the pictures I saw they do pretty good kid b-day and fruit cakes that are quite colorful, but yet they told me they don't work with a lot of color. I just think they should just get out of the business of doing wedding cakes altogether. Not to be mean, but I picked up an all white coconut cake for under $20 at Sam's Club that looked a whole lot better and only a fraction of the price ($16 vs $140).
5	Arai is absolutely adorable! The staff members there are friendly and handle your transactions with every semblance of care. My personal favorites from here are the chocolate coronets and the melon bread (UFO pan).
3	Don't judge by appearances when you first enter. You won't be blown away by the decor. This is a great place. It's not as great as the places found in San Francisco and LA, but it's passable. I want to give it four stars, but I'm a bit torn, if I could, I'd give it 3.5. What this place does really well is cakes and pastries. The cakes are light, fluffy and moist. Like Asian pastries should be, it's not overly sweet and oil. The flavor, taste and texture are right on. The bakers here also don't skimp on using good ingredients in the right proportions. The matcha mouse tastes like matcha and the frosting on the cake tastes like whipped cream beaten from heavy cream.What this place doesn't do well is baked goods. Their breads aren't great. It's kind of small and too airy and it just isn't very satisfying or impressive. I've tried multiple times and I'm just not a fan. If they just sold cakes and pastries I'd give the place four or maybe even five stars, but the breads are really lacking and detract from the overall quality of the establishment and experience.As I'm writing this, I realized that 3 stars is just cruel to a place like this, but I keep my ratings pretty strict, four stars is four stars and 3-3.999 is 3.Also, this place is a bit pricey if you're use to Safeway prices, but the taste is definitely better than Fry's or Costco.p.s. The cookies aren't great either.
5	Best (Asian) Pastry in town!!! Sooo Yummy!
5	Everything's just right! My favorite dessert here is "green tea mousse cake" it's not too sweet and rich creamy green tea whipped. I have tried all their cakes and pudding. Those are good too! Also the packaging is adorable. Nice staffs, always give me big smile every time I walk in.
4	Waltzing into Fujiya I noticed a Japanese bakery right next door. Oh Joy!After pillaging Fujiya of some much needed pantry staples I walked into Arai and picked up the Curry Bun, Yogurt Mousse, and the UFO. The Mousse and the UFO we're just A-ok but......THE CURRY BUN WAS THE BOMB - And full of carrots. Seriously folks if you like Japanese curry and a nice pillowy airy bun this culinary piece can be yours for $1.75.I agree with a lot of John C.'s points - food is pretty quality but pales in comparison to other bakeries along the West Coast. But we're in the middle of the desert so I'll round up. (I also will be back to try Asian Birthday Fruit Cake and Strawberry Slice)
5	Love me some Arai Bakery.  My wife is from Japan, so we pretty much come here weekly.  It has become the only place were we buy birthday cakes since my wife moved to the Phoenix area 13 years ago.  Kind of pricey but ohh so good.  The bread they make there also can't be beat.  The word on the street is that since Ichiro Suzuki started spring training in AZ that he has the bread express delivered too him weekly.  As a side note you can make the absolute best grill cheese sandwich with Arai white bread.  Mmmmh bread!  Cream Pan, Curry Pan, An Pan (filled with anko bean paste which is an acquired taste) are all really good.   Arai-san is truly an artisan who takes great pride in his work.  Consistently delicious baked goods
5	I buy cakes from here especially for birthdays! Love their breads such as an pan, ufo and curry bread. Never tried their sweets so cant say anything there. Dont really care for their greentea shake because I dont like the strong milk flavor and weak matcha... they should offer a soy option and not skimp on the matcha... then id get a shake everytime. For the most part...best pastry bakery shop with the best cakes. Okay.
5	I cannot say enough good about the artistry done on two birthday cakes we ordered.  They were light, not too sweet, absolutley delicious, fresh, and artfully created.  Everyone loved them and asked where we got them.  Additionaly, the staff were wonderfully pleasant and accomodating.  We will order all of our cakes there from now on!!!!
4	Apparently this is the only japanese bakery in PHX.   Since I was on the way to the airport, I decided to drop by.The place has a range of pastries and drinks.    I had the green tea mousse (if you like light and not very overpowering sweet with subtle taste, get this) and true Japanese coffee (mild with a strong coffee taste with liquid sugar and milk - think blue mountain.... personally I think most american coffee is burnt as hell and too bitter).    Oh yeah... these guys are from fukuoka on the west tip of japan.
4	Tried a slice of strawberry cake. The whip cream frosting was nice and light with a dense vanilla cake. There was a very small selection of desserts to choose from. Overall the dessert was nice, not too sweet, but could have used more strawberries.
5	Everyone should try this awesome bakery. My favorite are strawberry and chocolate cakes!
5	Whenever I'm craving dessert, this is the first place I want to go. I've been here quite a few times since my first review, and every item I've had has been delectable. Today I had a curry bread, iced coffee, and picked out an assortment of sweets for a get together in the evening. While the guys that are typically baking in the back can be brusque, the young woman that works here is always so cheerful, pleasant, and eager to help. Upgrade 1 star!
4	Great desserts. Less sweet than my bachelor american pallet is used to... But that made the desert feel less guilty while still tasting fresh and delicious!I will be stopping by again .
5	The desserts are delicious! Their drinks are very good, too. Green Tea Milkshake tastes a lot like the Green Tea Frappuccino from Starbucks, but you get much more for same price! Earl Grey tea cake an green tea mousse are my favorites.
5	Decided to try the bakery after reading other's reviews. Spot on...delicious! Customer service excellent. I think she was an owner because she thanked us for supporting local. She also took the time to explain their bakery and show us their design book. I will be ordering from them. And the plus...it is not sweet!
5	I absolutely love this bakery! They're super friendly and all of their pastries are to die for, but my personal favorites are the chocolate cornets. I just finished the last of the ones I picked up yesterday, they never last long! Strongly recommend!
5	This place is ridiculously amazing. I went in and couldn't decide what I wanted. it all looked way too delectable, so I had them pick out some items for me. Was not disappointed. I'm hooked. Very friendly staff, and you can tell they love what they do. Left with a smile, and was even happier when I got home and stuffed my face. Thank you, arai pastry!
5	Fantastic !!! .. looks like a Roman bakeries ... but inside you can find the sweet fantastic !!!!!!!!. Those peanut butter have pieces of peanut butter that melts in your mouth !!! The best thing is to buy sweets, go to Central Park which is located just two steps away and enjoy them in the green Excellent !!!
