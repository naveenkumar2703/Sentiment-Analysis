5	Chronic Tacos? YES!The second I walked into this place I was blown away.  Tucked away in the middle of Summerlin is a place called "Chronic Tacos" that breathes new life into this other wise sterile shopping center.First impression of the place that hasn't been open a week... what is all this writing on the wall? Did all this writing happen in less than a week?They supply the sharpies and you are welcomed to write on the walls and tables.They have an employee come up to you when you first hit the line and they get you a drink while you wait on what seems to be the honor system.They carry coke products and I opted for the safe choice of Minute Maid Lemonade.I came at 8:30pm at night and this place was still busy!  The music was blaring, the line was friendly, the staff was friendly, the entire place was like entering your cool friends house in high school.  When my turn came up, I opted for the Carne Asada Burrito which I had made with: spanish rice, black beans, "baja style" sauce, pico de gallo salsa, cheese, cilantro and onions.  My meal with the burrito and the drink came out to under $9.Let me tell you, all the staff are super friendly and I have never seen a group of people that appear to absolutely love their jobs!  A very refreshing experience.After we sat down to eat, we were greeted by 5 different people that offered to refill your drinks or take away your trash.I am definitely coming back to this place very soon!The food was great!  The atmosphere was great!I asked one of the employees and they say they are open from 9am to 9pm.One more thing - Scream "I Love Chronic Tacos!" and just see what happens...
2	So this place is real new and i had to try this place when I saw the line out the door (was going to sultans grill next door).  From the door I thought I was going to be in heaven considering it was so packed and the menu was awesome with burritos, tacos, and tortas and they had pastor and carnitas, in the end I was let down.  I got a steak burrito and a pastor taco.First the burrito was priced ok at 6 bones and it was a buck more for guac, not bad.  The carne asada was not good, like really finely chopped up meat stewing in taco sauce that tasted like something made from a package of taco seasoning mix, and it didn't have a good steak texture.  To be honest it really reminded me of crappy taco meat.  The rice tasted bland and the refried beans tasted canned to me.  It wasn't too big either, chipotle or cafe rio is way bigger for the price.  Also the tortillas weren't really good, not going to put it into words why I didn't like them but rio has some awesome tortillas and this place didn't.  It absolutely tasted like some one made mexican night at there house with taco meat, rice a roni spanish rice, canned beans, and mission tortillas. The pastor in the taco had good flavor for sure but it wasn't that meaty and was mushy in texture, one taco was 3 bucks and it was a little skimpy too, nothing memorable and except for the pork it had that same "generic" flavor as the burrito.Now the service was extremely friendly and what looked like the owner came by and asked how everything was and was real nice too.  I did have to wait a while but I saw the line so no negative thing about that.  I have waited a long time for slider truck and it's delicious so no big deal, what do you expect when a place is slammed. My advice for anyone who cares or is listening, better seasoning of the rice and beans (home made if it isn't), and grill up some real carne asada.  The portions aren't as big as rio or chipotle, the quality isn't as good as rio or chipotle, and it isn't cheaper than rio or chipotle, something isn't adding up.  Oh well the place is packed (for now at least) so what do I know.
1	***UPDATE 7/27/2010***I workout at the 24 Hour Fitness next to Chronic Tacos and came out to find Chronic Tacos flyers on the cars in the parking lot, including mine (see pics).  That's lame, taking to sleazy nightclub tactics to promote the business....blech!  One more reason not to go there for me.***ORIGINAL REVIEW***I passed by this place yesterday after having lunch at Upper Crust Pizza....it was very busy and looked cool, so I said I would try it the next day.Well....I stopped by for lunch after a workout at the gym.  It was 12:15 pm and there was a big line of about 20 people.  I decided to wait it out and see what everyone was waiting for.  While I was in line, it grew to about 30 people.The place is decorated like a teenager's bedroom.  The walls are made of plywood and you are encouraged to tag up the walls with whatever (see pics).  I think the owners are MMA fans because there were MMA magazines all over the place and the guy who brought out my food had a MMA T-Shirt & hat.Food - I was going to try a Carne Asada burrito, but I wanted to try 2 dishes, so i opted for the Nachos (no meat) and a Carne Asada Fatty Taco.  It's a typical setup like you find at Qdoba/Zaba's/Chipotle where you order your food and you move down a line of people to add the toppings.The Carne Asada Taco ordering process went smoothly, but the Nachos didn't....they forgot to make it as they rely on someone in the back who's not part of the assembly line to make it.  They yell out the order and I guess someone is suppose to pay attention and make it....well, they didn't.  No big deal at this point, it's only Nachos and it doesn't take a long time to make those....so, they told me when I paid that they would bring it out.I had a pretty good workout and built up a huge appetite, so I scarfed down the Carne Asada Taco while I waited for the Nachos.....it was pretty good, not great but good....nice flavor but it wasn't "authentic".  i guess growing up in SoCal makes you a Mexi-Snob when it comes to Mexican Food.After a few minutes my Nachos came out....I was surprised to see that there was only cheese on top of chips.  Normally at Baja Fresh/Qdoba/Chipotle/Zaba's nachos are fully loaded with all the toppings....hell, I even paid extra for guacamole.  I asked the guy who brought them about it, he apologized about the guac and said he would come back with a cup of it....but he said that's how the Nachos with no meat are prepared, with just cheese.  What a disappointment!To make matters worse, the cheese is shredded cheese that they melt on top of the chips....that in and of itself isn't that big a deal....what was really a big deal is that the cheese wasn't fully melted, just the top of it so it didn't stick to the chips and it fell all over the place because it was still cold and shredded underneath (see pics for details).  The guacamole was bland too.  I still ate it because I was hungry.  What a bad meal....I should have went somewhere else.The place was crowded and the majority of the people in there were younger (early 20's and teens)....I guess they like the atmosphere.  Since I don't follow MMA at all, it didn't appeal to me.....and the years of writing crap on the walls are decades behind me.I would have rated the place 2 Stars if the line was shorter...but because the hype was built up and it didn't deliver, I gave it 1 Star.  It's the 1st 1 Star joint I've rated.Will I return?  Nah.....unless someone else was paying the bill.
3	I heard about his place before and always wondered if the food was good. My verdict is yes.The decoration of the restaurant is cool and it has that "skateboarders at the beach" southern cali feel to it. They have a wide variety of food there but like any spot  I go to that serve Mexican food I gauge the food by how good the carne asada tacos are and I must say that although they are a little bit pricier than what I am normally used to paying, they were very good! The meat was flavorful and juicy. The setup is similar to Chipotle or Zaba's were you pick what kind of filling you want. I went with the simple "authentic" onions, cilantro and salsa. The guy who was making the tacos was like "is that all??? no lettuce or cheese?". I know that most people who like to eat more Americanized tacos like to have lettuce and cheese and all that but no self respecting authentic Mexican food lover like myself would do that to a taco. I can see how that would justify the $3 each asking price though if you get one of those "super duper supreme look i got all this stuff in my taco" kinda tacos so I'm not knocking them on that. The other thing I got was the chicken flautas which actually were really good although I think they were frozen and not fresh. If I go back, I will have to try the enchiladas cause I love me some enchiladas too.Oh and the staff is really nice and friendly too. I wasnt able to find a lid for my drink and one of the girls notice me walking back and forth lookin for them. She apologized and ran in the back to get some more and said that next time to tell them right away and they will give me a bigger drink for free! Pretty cool if you ask me!
4	I didn't know what to expect when I came here ...maybe this would taste like Rubios? I think the fish tacos are much better here then Rubio's but the Shrimp taco impressed me the most ! I was expecting it to be made of popcorn shrimp but they were good sized shrimps for the money you pay. My husband had the Carne Asada burrito he said it was better then Robertos....I was like, "Are you sure"? The reason I questioned him on that is because Roberto's is our "go to place"  for So Cal comfort food . He said that he liked that their burrito didn't have a lot of meat fat (he hates meat fat) and it just overall tasted better. If you don't like beans or rice in your burrito make sure you tell them you want it on the side. We also ordered the guacamole and chips which I wasn't a fan of. I don't think they give you a lot of Guacamole compared to how many chips and it wasn't spicy enough for me. I liked their drink selection which had sodas, teas and Orange Whip ... it's like an Orange Julius. I was happy with the food and I would definitely come back!
1	this place sucked!! we heard about it so decided to check it out. the food SUCKED!! and the service SUCKED!!  we walked in and no one was in line and there were 5 people behind the counter and it took several minutes for anyone to ask to take our order. the kid was too busy in his conversation to listen to our order we had to repeat it multiple times! the rice was waaaaayyy over cooked it was like eating oatmeal in a burrito! the beans were disgusting! the meat was like grease soup! the tortillas were way over toasted that it was cracking and breaking. all around a horrible experience! some people seem to love it but theyre obviuosly high or have never tasted good food.
4	I just tried this place the other night on a whim with my friend. We both ordered the tostada bowl, to go, with Carne Asada.  The place has a very different look to it. Funky decor. Young staff who were SUPER friendly and joking around with us. Very helpful and said hello the second we walked in the door.The Tostada Bowl was EXCELLENT! It was so delicious. Nice cruncy shell, with all the fixings you want inside. Shell did not get soggy and stayed nice and crunchy. Highly recommend giving this place a shot. I am surpriesd by the mixed reviews, I thought this place was great!
1	Over priced food!  Have gone several times and have experienced long waits each time; and the assemblers of the food put lime on my food twice after I said no. I also got corn instead of flour tortillas. Too many mistakes for a four dollar taco. The allowing of writing is insulting, writing by hundreds of teenagers with bad language and inappropriate content. Go to Los Tacos on Sahara and VV. Much bigger tacos, better prices and better taste.
4	Oh man. Words can not describe how happy I am that we finally have a Chronic Taco. Not only is this place a cool place, the fish tacos are so GD good it makes me want to slap your mother. Two Beer battered fish tacos, baja style and you're ready. Don't miss out. What else are you gonna do? Eat at Del Taco. Go ahead fart knocker.
3	Bubonic chronic tacos!The LA area based taco shop has berthed a brand new face on the scene with their rock-n-roll persona with a twist of eats from south of the border! A few friends and I went to their grand opening week and sank my teeth into their carnitas (pork) burrito. Places like Chipotle, Zaba's, and Qdoba have similar recipes, but the there are some difference that make Chronic Tacos stand out:Spanish red rice-- Chipotle doesn't have different choices for rice, Zaba's has brown rice, and Qdoba doesn't have a variance in their rices. But Chronic has Spanish rice! :)Carnitas-- marinated pulled pork! It has a sweet taste to it that I haven't tasted before!Flautas-- deep fried taquitos! Ask for Baja sauce and enjoy!If you're looking for a taco joint with style, personality, and character Chronic Tacos packs it all into their joint! Last I heard of from one of the managers is that they're opening up the bar side of the restaurant soon so look out for that. And if you call an order in, ask for Tony. He's got good customer service!
4	I've seen these all over So. Cal before, but never tried it til they opened one here in Summerlin. It was pretty cool since it was my first time and their first time actually opening.It kinda has this Baja thing to it. IDK if it's cus the people actually making our food weren't mexican at all or because they had these skateboards hanging on their walls. And while you're waiting in line, they let you tag up the walls. Gives it this friendly kinda vibe for some reason.I've tried their carne asada tacos and their carnitas burrito. The carne asada tacos were pretty decent. The carnitas were really sweet and juicy. They have Monday specials 5 dollar burritos and Tuesday tacos! The service is quick and friendly. They always greet everyone at first step in the door. And the parking is plenty unless its a Sunday. Sunday is the busiest I've seen it.
5	one word - fish tacos. Go.
2	I'm from San Diego, CA, so I pretty much grew up with Mexican food. Taco shops were ubiquitous in my 'hood. Taco Bell and Tex-Mex? Flour tortillas and ground beef? No thank you, sir. So Chronic Taco reminds me of those taco shops that weren't that good, but you went because you were desperate and broke. And they always left you with belly full of grease. That's what Chronic reminds me of. Behind the faux-cool interior decor that includes graffiti tagged walls, Chronic cannot serve decent food consistently. I work nearby, so I know what's up. I think. At times, the food is good. But the next day can be downright gross. Their chicken tacos left me nauseated. I like their vegetarian and potato taco the best. The potato taco is probably the most interesting item in my opinion, it's like a mashed potato taco that is deep fried. Blasphemy right? It's actually tasty (in moderation, of course!) . But their veggie and potato tacos aren't good enough to visit every week. Next time, I'm sticking to Los Tacos.
3	These tacos will not get you "faded."+ Baja style fish tacos are outstanding- It has a very "bro" atmosphere+ The service is friendly
2	We got a couple of Groupons for Chronic Tacos, so decided to give it a try.The first time we went I got a pollo asado taco and a shrimp taco. They were okay. The chicken was pretty salty. I'm a big fan of salt, so if I thought it was salty, it must have been really salty. The shrimp taco was okay but not particularly memorable.My wife got a carne asada burrito. It was okay. Nothing special.The second time we went we got beef taquitos and a chicken quesadilla. I liked the taquitos and the quesadilla much better than the tacos and the burrito. However, I don't really have any desire to go back.The decor is suited for teenage skater boys.
3	Came to Chronic Taco's due to a Groupon. The concept is similar to Chipotle/Zaba's in that everything is put together right in front of you but the decor/service is very X-Games/Skater.The food was good, not great but good. It did not seem to give you the "healthy" vibe that you get at Chipotle/Zaba. I had the chicken tostada bowl (without the shell) and my girlfriend had the chicken fajita burrito which was rather tasty. I liked that they had all the normal "mexican drink" options like horchata etc to choose from.I would go again but not before I would go to Chipotle or Zaba.
2	How much salt do you need to put on the freaking carne asada?  Seriously, I hope you guys are using a recipe and not eyeballing it. The deep fried fish taco was good. Would have been netter if it was in a corn tortilla like I asked for. My server seemed a lot too confused.  I may go back at some point.  Also, I'm not thrilled about paying $13 for 3 tacos and a drink. The equivalent at Roberto's is like $9.
4	OMG, the chicken Fatty Tacos are good....Good TV and I like the option of having fries with my Mexican food.
4	Tried Chronic Tacos for dinner tonight with the Groupon I've had for a bit.  Went with my girlfriend, and we split baja fish taco and a chicken burrito with a drink and chips.  Entire order was under our $12 Groupon, so decent value.  Food was just OK.  Actually, the chicken burrito was pretty tasty once I put Tapatio on it.  But the baja fish taco was a bit underwhelming.  Bonus points for having Coke Zero, though.  I hate when places only have Diet Coke.
3	This place is ok. I had a Groupon and decided to check it out. I tried the chicken burrito, while my fella ordered the chicken enchiladas. My burrito was ok, a little lacking in flavor, but I did ask for the salsa on the side, so that could be my fault. Once I poured some of the green stuff on there, it was pretty good. My fella's enchiladas stole the show. They were melty and cheesy, just how I like them! They were filled to the brim with moist and meaty chicken. It was all white meat, we were quite surprised and impressed. This was my favorite thing about the meal. This isn't authentic Mexican food by any stretch of the imagination and I think some of their dishes lack flavor, but it was still pretty good for the price.Not a big fan of the decor. It's obviously targeting a younger crowd, which is fine. A little too scuffed up and graffiti'd for my taste. Boy, do I sound old! HahaOverall, pretty good experience. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but if I'm in the area or have another Groupon on my hands, I'm totally there.
2	Hummmm, we took a drive from the Silverado area, to go there, because of our Groupon that we got. Well, it was OK, not worth driving over there again for. If your in the area, and don't want to spend alot of money, this might be the place for you. It's not like taco bell, so just something different. Yes we noticed it was geared towards teens and young adults. Not that that bothered me. I got the Enchiladas, and the fish taco, baja style, it was OK, my husband got the Carna Estada Tacos, he said it was OK. They said they make there own Salsa everyday, the chips actually tasted better without the salsa. I just say, don't go out of your way to go here, if your in the area......Then check it out for yourself.
4	Didn't know until today that we had this in town so I decided to give it a try. Had the carne asada burrito meal. The burrito was good,but better once I put some hot sauce in it, the chips were better by themselves than with the salsa. This is better than Roberto's, but I'm not going out of my way to come here and eat.Had a very "Bro" vibe, awkward.
4	good food! subway type of style, as in you order a carne asada taco and you decide all the topings. Ive tried the chicken, carne asade, and al pastor. Stay away from the carne asada as a mexican whose had their share of great mexican restaurants this did not taste much like carne asada. But then again this isnt a true mexican restaurant so...Portions are HUGE beans and rice and yummy! Its a lil pricey but def worth it.
4	I dig Chronic Tacos, I'd eaten at Wee-Man's location in Redondo Beach prior to discovering the location here in Vegas.  The one here in Summerlin is nice...not as cool as Wee-Man's, but his is also 3 blocks away from the beach and has a full bar inside, plus he frequents his store so it's almost an unfair comparison.  Anyways, the food here is very good!  I find it tastier than the other mexican grub joints like Roberto's, Chipotle, Qdoba, Rubio's, etc.  The daily homemade salsa here is awesome!  Their chips are always fresh and tasty too.  And however they cook and season their chicken...I'm definitely a fan.  Their steak is very tasty too.  I've personally never tried the pork, and I don't eat shrimp so I can't comment on their quality.  I usually stick with the chicken burrito bowl which is stellar!  The way they finely dice up their onions and cilantro make for tasty toppings.  All three of their salsas are great too!  The salsa verda is hella bomb!  I'm a fan of their tacos too, I like how they offer both flour and corn tortillas.  They pack them out with meat and toppings.I wish they offered more beverage options, and I wish it wasn't so far away.  Having to drive all the way up into Scummerlin for my Chronic fix can get annoying.  But the grub is so good that the drive isn't so horrible.
5	First time I had this was when I lived in SoCal -- Pasadena location.  It was AWESOME.  I got a shrimp burrito and never looked back... Well OK that's a lie.  I looked back when I went back almost every month for this!  (It was almost an hour drive or it would have been WAY more often)I AM SO HAPPY THERE IS ONE IN LAS VEGAS!  It totally channels that SoCal surfer dude feel and the employees seem to really dig their jobs -- which makes service awesome.  As much as I love their burritos, I have found something else that makes my heart cry for another:Chronic Fries.Oh my DSJHFSKD dude, get these with carne asada and slather on some baja sauce and go to heaven.  Bro, these fries are legit.Bottom line: Awesome prices, good service, good seating, and epic food.  Join their Chronic Tacos Loyalty Program and receive random discounts n'stuff!
4	Second time here, just as good as the last. Even better actually since I had 3 beer battered shrimp tacos this time. Yes burritos and tacos aren't the most completed thing to make but they are easy to mess up. Chronic tacos know's what it's doing and does it right with big portions too.
4	I would say if Chipotle had a Younger Rockstar brother. That would be chronic tacos. There is graffiti on the walls nothing offensive. But they are taking it down. :( The employees are friendly and personable and strike up great conversations. The menu has a little more diversity then chipotle but is set up with the assembly line. They have Tortas and Nachos and breakfast burritos. And just about everything comes with a vegetarian option not just the standard bean and cheese variety. They also have specials on Monday with Burritos and Tuesday is for the tacos. The burrito is massive filled with steak and your choice of rice and beans, cilantro, pico de gallo. When i frequent Summerlin i know where ill be.
5	We are hooked!!! Came in for the first time today Unsure of what to really expect I can say... It maybe far from my house but I'm willing to make that drive!!!Staff seemed friendly! And they didn't judge me out loud when I practically ordered one of everything on the menu! Ha!We will be back time and time again! You guys need one of these Next door to my house!!! Thank you guys so much!!!
3	I'd heard pretty mixed things about it from people I know, but the reviews on here are positive for the most part. I went there last week and found the food to be just OK. I got the beer-battered fish taco and and a carne asada taco. The fish taco had a good-sized piece of fish on it, but it really had no flavor. It was pretty much a giant fish stick on a tortilla. I'm not even a huge fan of fish, but this seriously had no fish flavor to it at all. The carne asada seemed a bit more like big chunks of ground beef sitting in juice. The flavor was good, but not really what I've come to expect from carne asada. The tortillas were good and the toppings and sauce on the tacos had a nice taste. The last part I took issue with were the chips: All I could smell when they were anywhere near my face was the grease that they were fried in. I like fried foods as much as the next person, but the oil smell was so overpowering I couldn't eat more than a few chips.The best part of this place - and what sets it apart from any other place I've ever been - is that they have Gringo Bandito hot sauce on the tables. If you don't know what that is and you like hot sauce, you really need to check it out. It's such a flavorful sauce and goes well on pretty much anything. Well done, Chronic Taco staff, for having great taste in hot sauce.I might come back to try some more things if I'm in the area or some friends want to check it out, but I don't think I'll be making a special trip by myself.
3	If my favorite San Diego or Tijuana tacos could talk to me:Tacos: "What's that smell on you?"Me: "What smell?"Tacos: "Did you cheat on me in Las Vegas?"Me: (horrible liar) "uh... no..."Tacos: "How could you?"** What happens in Vegas... OH STOP IT... Yeah anyways, actually I'm the one who feels cheated... I mean it's like test driving a Chrysler 300 when you've got a Rolls Royce Phantom at home!!!After you've already delighted yourself with SD or TJ tacos especially those super flavorful Adobada street tacos, mmm, mmm, mmm, it's just nearly unfair to compare with 'otra cosa' taqueria even if it's another LA/Orange County institution a hundred miles up the road like Chronic Tacos (Las Vegas location, in this case).For starters, do yourself a favor if you are ever in SD and try this spot right here (you can thank me later):http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-gordo-chula-vista#hrid:4OAN7amKTy_wgQAiPz2ZQQLooks like Mike C (originally from SD) also knows what I'm talking about: http://www.yelp.com/biz/chronic-tacos-las-vegas#hrid:RJNasrlnO69eizLItnicjQMy sister Alli S, who now lives in Vegas, suggested this taco shop and told me that the tacos were "Surfer-dude style tacos"... (I'll give you a minute to think about that one)... uhh, huh?  So, whatever that means... (haha I love you sis but it looks like you need to come back home to SD lol!)  Tacos were okay, not bad though I'll say this, this "Surfer-dude style" taqueria might be the hippest looking around!  http://eatchronictacos.com/index.php = see what I mean...You want hip:Carne Asada tacos was AAIIIGHT!Surfer-dude hip:The Al Pastor tacos was BAMMERWEE!  (from Riptionary.com - Surf Lingo)http://www.riptionary.com/cgi-bin/surfinglingo.pl?query=all&stpos=50&stype=and(PS Don't get me wrong, I'll still drive the crap out of a Chrysler 300!)
2	Please stop referring to this place as a "California" taco shop, the only thing Cali about this place is it's reference to a certain drug in it's name.  The place looks like a tatoo parlor, nothing "surfer" about it.  The food was just eh and they do not even have a salsa bar.  NO self-respecting real mexican joint goes without a salsa bar. I ordered the beef flautas and a cheese quesadilla.  This is comman fare in any mexican stand.  The flautas were actually very good, generous amounts of meat in them and happily not over cooked.  They were crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.. but not very flavorful, you definitely need guacamole or salsa with them.  The quesadilla was a flop.  Their first attempt at my quesadilla resulted in one that was so over cooked that the line cook could not cut it with his knife.  He had to saw into it and he ACTUALLY thought he was going to serve this to me.  I looked at the cashier and said, "don't you think that's over done".  She immediately told the cook to make another one.  Take two - this time the cashier stood over the grill and cut it up herself for me.  I think the problem here is they are making the quesadilla's in a panini grill and it toughens the tortilla before the cheese melts fully.  Any decent cook knows to make them on the grill and flip them, this way the tortilla doesn't have a chance to dry out and the cheese has time to melt.I'll wait to go back to San Diego and have real mexican food rather than go back to this place.NOT TO FORGET:  A plain cheese quesadilla is 5 bucks, WTF?
4	You can't go wrong with anything on the menu! The staff is friendly, the food is fresh and made to order and my kid LOVES this place!My fave is the tostada bowl with chicken!They also have great fish tacos with home made baja sauce - YUM!
3	Decided to visit Chronic Tacos in the charming Las Vegas suburb of Summerlin, Nevada. Glad I made the trip up from Los Angeles. The staff were super friendly, and helpful. I ordered a carnitas burrito, my two friends ordered a shrimp burrito, and a carnitas burrito, and we got two orders of flautas for the table, chicken and beef. I loved my burrito and the flautas. My friend said her carnitas was bland, a problem easily remedied with gringo bandito or some of their house salsa. The meal was overall very tasty. The wall of the restaurant features a Chronic Tacos logo over a huge skyline of the Las Vegas strip. It was cool, except people wrote stuff all over it with magic marker. The mens room was vandalized with graffiti too. This Chronic Tacos had it's own bar, and artwork painted and embossed into the floor: a giant taco, the corporate logo, the words: Chronic Tacos, among other things. A shaded dining area exists outside for al fresco dining on days the temperature drops below 100 degrees. Glad I came by Chronic Tacos in Summerlin, NV. It was a great way to spend my labor day lunch with friends.
4	Fresh shrimp tacos - I saw the guy saute the shrimp myself - served on a steamy warm corn tortilla with my kind of hand fulls of cilantro, onion, cabbage and tomatillo sauce... mmmmmm, I'll definitely be back.
2	*Sigh* You know when you really want to like a place, but every time you go you're disappointed until you finally just realize that place sucks?  Chronic Tacos is that place for me.I wanted to like it because it is a similar concept to Chipotle, but they have more options like quesadillas, nachos, and tortas.  I liked that about the place, but I have found after three visits that the food just isn't that good.  The meat is dry.  The lime rice has no flavor.  The guacamole is brown.  They charge extra for sour cream.  Not to mention that they have GOT to get their assembly line in order.  All the times I have gone, the food has been piled up and I've had to keep my eye on my order because:(1) they will mix up the orders and try to put other people's burritos with yours so that when you get up to the register, there are magically three burritos they want to charge you for, or (2) ask what you want on your nachos when you ordered a quesadilla and you have to tell them multiple times that those nachos aren't yours but that quesadilla that somehow got pushed to the back of the assembly line is.I also don't like how you have to pay extra for chips and salsa, yet they don't have a slasa bar.  You have to ask the crazed assembly line people for salsa and good luck if you need more salsa, because you won't be able to get back up there without standing in line again.And then the decor...they encourage you to write all over the walls, booths, napkin dispensers, and even in the bathrooms.  Just gives the whole place a dirty, cheap vibe.  "Come to Chronic Tacos and be the hoodlum you've always wanted to be!  Draw a penis on the wall if you want!!"I tried, I really did, but I just can't find love for this place.
3	I've been here a couple of times.  Each time, I've had difficulty ordering because it is just so confusing.  It's kind of like Chipotle but they have a ton more options and it's not quite clear what those options are.  I think you just have to lean against the glass and grunt, "I want that."  Very stoner.I've tried the chicken tostada bowl, chronic fries, a battered shrimp taco, and a carne asada taco.  The chicken tostada was ok but it came with a pathetic amount of sour cream and they left off the guacamole I ordered.  But I don't think they charged me for it, either.  The chronic fries, basically covered in everything including salsa, were pretty damn good though.  For whatever reason, these are advertised on their website, but are not on the menu.The carne asada seems to be their claim to fame, but I didn't like it.  Too salty.  Then again, I got the very last bit of carne asada.  They were out by 6pm.  So maybe I didn't get the best representation of this dish, being the last little bit they had and all.  Also, he asked me if I wanted it baja style.  I said sure and that was a big mistake.  Mayo, cabbage.... doesn't really work with carne asada for me.  However, the shrimp taco baja style = excellent.They have Dos Equis and Blue Moon on tap - $3 a pint.  The bar was completely empty.  I'm not sure if it is worth it for this place to have a liquor license.I'm willing to try this place again and maybe get some booze.  But I need to have a heart to heart with the staff and get the low down on the menu.
4	This place is pretty yummy!I came here bc my friend wantef some enchiladas. Here you get 2 for 4.99$ with any meat. I ordered a chicken burrito but it looked gross so the girl was such a sweetie and let me get something else. Instead I ordered 2 potato tacos with cheese and a kids meal with chicken taquitos for my son. After paying I heard a man ordering some carne asada fries and I was like "hold up!" She said its on their "secret menu" so I got an order of those.My friend said his enchiladas were good. My sons taquitos were also very very good and he loved the chips and salsa. I tried my potato tacos and I was like YAY! They were super delish! The carne asada fries (7$) were also very yummy! The only thing that sucked was they dont come with guac, its 1$ extra and also you have to like yell over the glass thingy.All in all the food was yummy and cs was awesome!
2	On my first visit to Chronic Tacos, I tried their chicken tacos. The meat was pretty salty and I was pretty underwhelmed by the meal. I had some coworkers rave about this place so I decided to give it another shot. Second visit, tried the carne asada tacos. Salty and dry. I think my coworkers were smoking some chronic when they ate here. That's the only explanation I can think of.
5	Beer Battered Fish tacos with baja sauce!!2 Fatty tacos & I'm done.. Chronic Tacos is pretty amazing.
4	This is the 2 or 3rd rime I ate here.  I liked it with all the crazy tagging, then they half way removed everything. The food is delicious (better than Roberto's), the tables were clean, and they gave me what I wanted- when I wanted it. So my only suggestion to improve is to finish what you started or allow the crazy kids to have fun. On this visit it was nice to see that they finally put in all of the tv's. I wish there was sound though.
5	Love the fatty tacos - I got Pollo Asado and medium hot sauce!  The sauce makes these, as it is more a sauce than an salsa.  The pollo Asado quesadilla was very good!  The price is great - and the service very friendly!
3	Chronic Tacos is like Chipotle but with far more choices including seafood.  They offer a wide variety of filling and sauce options.  I like the grilled shrimp burrito.  They also have a small bar area with decent beer prices as well as a patio were you can escape from the somewhat chaotic main dining area.
3	The Fish Burrito is HUGE  and very good....almost TOO Big!.....warning this is fried  fish so extra gym time might be required later.  All the team who works there are very friendly and helpful.   Good spot for lunch when in Summerlin.
4	I just love this place! We have been a few times now since living in the neighborhoodand will for sure be back.I thought it was pretty rad that you could tag up the walls!If you make a make it a combo then you get a drink, rice and chips and salsa.I really like the "Carne Asada Quesadilla" it is just chocked full of flavor.The burritos are huge and the tortillas very tasty.For the 2 of us to eat it averages about $22 and worth every penny.Give this little gem a try if you haven't yet!The parking lot can be full depending on the time of day but the way the lot is grouped together it isn't a far walk from wherever you do end up parking.
4	I've become a regular here since the food is made to order, good portions, and you leave full without the greasy feeling you get from many other places around town.  There's also various specials throughout the week and my favorite is Torta Thursday where you get a free drink and chips. So far I've had tortas, fish tacos, and breakfast burritos but must admit the fries look pretty amazing topped with meat and cheese.  What I really enjoy is choice of tortillas, grilled or fried fish tacos, and every step of preparing your order is asked for input from you.  I also love that when I'm taking a break here during the work week I can also grab a much needed Rockstar that they keep in stock in multiple flavors.
3	I love Chronic Tacos' food, always fresh and well-prepared! My problem is the restaurant ALWAYS seems to close early. I've shown up several times ten minutes before the advertised 9 pm closing time, and the doors are already locked. So I spend my money nearby at Port of Subs, which also closes at 9 but actually stays OPEN until 9. Verdict: food great, customer convenience not so much...
2	Eh. I wanted to find a place where I could get a couple of cheap tacos and a beer so I gave it shot with the family. It wasn't bad, just nothing special. I would give it 2 1/2 stars if that was an option.The food is okay. I had an al pastor taco and a carne asada taco, and I tried a few bites of my wife's chicken burrito. It was all just okay - can't say anything bad, but not really anything good to say either. I'd honestly rather hit Taco Bell, and I can think of 10 Mexican restaurants/taco shops in Vegas I would rather go to.The staff was friendly, but a little unorganized. We were one of 3 other parties in the place and it kind of took awhile to get the food. Maybe the staff was new or something.I get the whole graffiti thing and trying an alternative casual look, but it's a little over the top. Sharpie marker written all over the walls, rails, seats, and everything else that seems to be written mostly by teenagers wanting to be hard-core by dropping an F-bomb via permanent marker. Whatever.If I happened to be in that shopping center and felt like a taco or burrito I might try it again, but not going out of the way to go back.
4	3.75 StarsI'm not driving out of my way to stop at Chronic Tacos, but when I'm in the area, I know I'll be full and satisfied eating here.I like Chronic for the strong flavors and good portions.  Plenty of options for fillings.  Good prices.  This is not a traditional taqueria...it's Americanized...or Californianized (is that a word?), but the food is still solid. Slight divey feel is appealing to some as well.
2	We first saw Chronic Tacos in LA, but never got the chance to eat there. So, when I heard there was one in Vegas, my brother and I sought it out. The only way to get there from my side on town - the SW - is to risk your life via several roundabouts. I'm a skilled driver, but I despise those things. We made it in one piece without incident, phew.Now give me food to calm myself.Not able to decide on what I wanted, I ordered three tacos: fish, carnitas and carne asada. My brother tried the chicken and carne asada. We were the only people in the restaurant and the staff seemed highly annoyed by our presence. I grabbed a diet coke from the soda machine and it tasted terrible, flat yet it tasted only like seltzer. I couldn't drink it. I don't do regular soda so I was out of luck.I dug into the tacos. The fish taco wasn't the worst I've had, but I wouldn't call it good. Edible. The Carnitas were the best of three. The carne asada was so salty. I about died. It was inedible. My brother agreed on the carne and thought the chicken was decent. I couldn't believe I risked my life on the roundabout deathtraps for this! Leaving, I was forced to gamble again. A few close calls, but we made it home safely. Thank goodness, I would not want Chronic Tacos for a last meal.
3	Had a carne Asada burrito it's was pretty good. But I do like chipotle better.
3	The marinated pork is really good. Everything else is kinda meh.
3	I ahve gone here a few times. It is convienent when at work. The staff is great. Always friendly. Will answer any question. Make suggestions. The food is ok. I really like the refried beans. Love the guacamole and chips. Of the meats I tried they are all to salty for my taste. The prices are reasonable. You can get a complete meal for under 6.00.
2	My sister in-law and I saw this place in an ad and made note to try it. Finally me, my sister, & cousin had a lunch date there and the food was Okay! Nothing great and I find it a bit over priced for the quality. I have a beef burrito enchilada style (so did my cousin) and my sister had chicken tacos. My sister ended up getting sick after! Although we did take advantage of being able to write on the walls and furniture. That was my only favorite part! We haven't and probably won't be back to eat there. I'll stick with Qudobas.
3	Positives:  Salsa (tomatoes/cilantro) is very good; extremely quick service and food was done; restaurant is clean; lots of seats and espn on t.v.Negatives: Salty carne asada meat; dry spanish riceI will try it again and get something different
4	Finally stopped in to give Chronic Tacos a try and I'm glad I did! The prices are super reasonable and you get a lot of bang for your buck. I grabbed lunch for Boyfriend and I on the way home from work. Two burritos, one carne asada and one carnitas. Both were the size of my dog. Both burritos were really good. I'd describe them as halfway between Chipotle and actual Mexican food. Chipotle format and style, but the meat would be perfectly at home in a Tijuana street taco. They have a ton of filling options, including al pastor and fish (!). Burritos ($5.99) and "Fatty Tacos" ($2.99) seem to be the main options. Plenty of toppings. They stuff those tortillas almost to bursting; no stinginess here! They also have a bar, which makes this place a great quick-but-not-fast-food dinner. After all, is there anything better in all the world than a cold beer and a giant burrito? I think not. Since I live in Henderson, I don't foresee us popping by for dinner, but I'll definitely be picking up to-go food in the future!
5	This place is closed and has been for over a month. I'm sad to see it go :(
