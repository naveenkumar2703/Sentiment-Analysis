1	I haven't walked into a place where all I get is a nod for a hello and an eyebrow for what do u want to drink, but I did today!!!   Sorry I  don't speak bad bartender Ryan.  Thats what I overheard his name was,  he didn't introduce himself.  Other than my crappy service my food was delish!  The lady that brought me my food was awesome, brought me my sides right away.  It took me 7 minutes to get my check...and that's 7 minutes of me trying to flag him down when he wasn't but 5 ft in front of me.  Since there a lot of pts in las Vegas, I'll just drive down the street and hit up another .....sahara and nellis is not the one to go to
3	Thry have a seperate eating area which is a plus for some that may not wanna smell like smoke but want the bar atmosphere . bald head bartender is very cool and attentive . they have a late night happy hour drinks/food which is cool the wings ive ordered tend to be on the more salty side garlic parmesan lemon pepper
1	So we show up here to get something to eat it was nine in the morning door was locked no problem will ring the bell the buzzer to get in ring ring ring ring no answer ring ring ring ring no answer so after waiting a few minutes ring ring ring then the bartender comes on the intercom to say you guys will not be getting n ringing the buzzer like that or reply was like what? We've been sitting here for over 5 minutes is what I said she said no you haven't I been watching you guys so the question is why are you watching this instead of allowing us to come in to eat breakfast definitely bad customer service this bartender should be fired
