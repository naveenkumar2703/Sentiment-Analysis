4	Fast and friendly service. Definitely the kind of place I enjoy supporting.
5	Was greeted warmly by one of the owners, Mark. Was looking for a new watchband for my Citizen Eco-Drive. Knowledgable and friendly - he patiently explained the different price levels and how the quality changed with the decisions I would make as the customer. I never felt rushed or hassled - really good experience. I left with a very nice watchband installed for a reasonable price. Have found my "go to" guys for my watches - excellent job and highly recommended!
1	Took a 3-year-old Seiko Perpetual Calendar watch in for battery replacement.  When I dropped it off the employee/owner? told me he could replace the battery, but wouldn't set the calendar.  I told him no problem, as I'd done it before and had the instructions.  I was frankly surprised at his comment.  It's not that tough.Got the watch back, paid my $17, and left.  When I got home, I noticed the date was stuck between 11 and 12.  No problem, I thought..  I'll do a full reset and just start from scratch.  The first simple step is to pull the crown out one click, hold the button for two seconds, and wait for the watch to drive the second hand to zero, and the date to 1.The second hand drove to 10, and the date never budged.  The watch worked perfectly until the battery began running low a few weeks ago.  In 30 minutes he managed to mess up the internal workings of my watch.  Guess that's why he was reluctant to agree to actually set it when he finished.I'll go to a certified Seiko repair facility from now on.
