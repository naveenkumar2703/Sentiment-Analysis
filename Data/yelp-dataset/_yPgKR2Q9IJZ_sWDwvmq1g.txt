4	Very nice little place, tucked away on the edge of the downtown area.  The food is very tasty -- I had the chevaps with fries, complemented nicely by their house red (a nice, bold Chilean).Service is cheery and friendly.  The prices are a little on the steep side, but the food is delish and plentiful.  Definitely on our "to go again" list.
5	It is well worth going and trying the plater for 2 just make sure you are hungry .for sure to be back once a week anywaysSee you soon
5	One of the best kept secrets in Kitchener.  I had no idea what Serbian food was, but I am glad I tried it.  It is small restaurant with very friendly service and all the food is homemade.  If you are a vegetarian, you won't find a lot to choose from, but carnivores will be very happy with large portions of meat.The grilled platter for two feeds 3-4 easily and lets you try 6 different meats and homefries for about $40.  We have tried many dishes and would order all again, schnitzel, ribs & chicken tenders, chicken parm, burgers, chevaps, kebabs.  Everything is homemade including the rolls and desserts.
5	We were skeptics about this place because of the location. If you love meat, this is the place for you! We had the platter for 2, that could of easily fed three adults! It was all fantastic! This is a hidden gem! Loved it!
