5	This is a boutique program serving an elite group of families with young children.
5	I could not be happier with this preschool. My first child is going to graduate to kindergarten this year and my second will be in the 3's class next year.  The teachers are outstanding.  After researching so many other preschools the thing about this preschool that makes it stand out is the community and the parent education.  As a first time parent not only was I not ready to send my child off to school and not be part of it but there was so much I didn't know.  Since this school is a co-op I was able to carry through with what my son learned at school and reinforce it at home.  I learned so much from the expert teachers.  In addition, I have formed close bonds to the other co-oping parents.  I can't think of a better way to model a sense of community to my children than to actually live it.  The school offers a developmentally appropriate curriculum and allows children to learn through play.  I could go on and on about this school and it's community!
5	I agree with everything Nicole N. so beautifully stated. My son just completed the 2s class and will be starting the 3s class in the fall. Besides the fact that he loves school and talks about his friends and teachers all the time, I was surprised by how much support I felt as a "first time mom". The school provides ongoing parent education, and the experienced teachers are always available to answer questions and offer advice. I also chose this school because it is open and welcoming to ALL, and they embrace diversity and lead by example.
