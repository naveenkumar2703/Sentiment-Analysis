2	Definitely a misleading store. You will find no great deals and no low prices. I don't know how they can have such outrageous prices and expect to do much business in Arizona Mills Mall. The staff seem clueless and unmotivated.
1	This is a crappy store.. all they have is bulk Ashley furniture and the manager of the store Veronica is a scam artist...they just rob you off your money....I ordered some furnitre and had to wait a week to get it from the store, when i went there there was only part of the order and new they wanted me to pay $99 for delivery...Avoid them by any means.
1	They advertise like they've got some huge showroom stocked with all of these amazing pieces of furniture, but you walk in their store and it's more than half empty with a few mundane couches and beds slammed up against the walls, when the center of the store is virtually empty.  Maybe they're going out of business and selling off their last (understandably unsold) pieces.  What a waste of a trip this was.  Their website, however, has some interesting pieces that presumably are available if you order online..
