2	Way overpriced for the 3 pieces of equipment that they offer. My 5 year old was extremely bored with it after only an hour and and my 20 month old did enjoy the "Toddler Zone" for about 30 minutes. Don't forget your socks-they cost about 3 dollars a pair...The only thing for small children (under 3) is the Toddler Zone which had maybe 6  padded shapes in it along with a little bounce house which mine really enjoyed, but that is it. The rest of the equipment is for ages 4 and up.Friendly Staff and the place was very clean for the most part- bathrooms could use some updating and deep scrub.Not worth the 22 dollars for 1.5 hours we spent there...would rather take them to Bounce Jungle or Bounce U for half that price.
3	My 3 year old LOVES this place!  It is smaller and there seems to not be as many "big kids" running around.  My "big kids (7 and 6) get easily bored here though.  I would recommend it for kids 5 and under not so much for anyone much older than that.
3	We were here for a birthday party.  Our 2 year old had a great time on the different bounce houses.  They have a seperate area for toddlers that has a smaller bounce house.
5	Awesome
