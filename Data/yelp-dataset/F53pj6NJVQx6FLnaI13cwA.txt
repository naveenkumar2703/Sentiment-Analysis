2	Mom and I decided to check this place out when a cousin and her soon-to-be 18-year-old daughter visiting from NJ went to check out Forever 21 (a store I've never found anything I wanted to purchase from).  Love Culture has some very cute clothing!  Inexpensive, too-  I was able to find four fun spring-summery tops (between $13-$22) I could actually wear under a suit for work.  Brightly-lit, colorful, and nicely-spaced aisles.  Staff seemed friendly enough.  Am not a fan of their return policy, though.  I was only told about the 22-day policy at checkout, and nothing about how sale items, shoes, and accessories were final sale.  Only found out about the latter when I wanted to return a purse the next day, only to be told that it could not be returned per policy which was printed on the back of the receipt.  I went around the area where the purses and shoes were, and NOWHERE, not even at the check-out counter, were there any signs that mentioned final sale.I'd still visit to see what pretty clothing I may find, but I'd definitely think thrice about purchasing from their shoes, accessories, and sale items.
