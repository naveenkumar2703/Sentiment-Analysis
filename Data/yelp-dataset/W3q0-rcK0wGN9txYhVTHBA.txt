4	For birthdays, anniversaries, graduations or any other special event for that matter, I like to make an effort when I am buying a card! I hate the bland, boring and dull cards that you see in every single high street card shop! However, if you manage to stumble upon the Bay Tree Company on Hanover Street you will find cards of a much higher quality than those in Clinton's. The shop is full of arty cards, cards which have style, cards which stand out from other cards! If you want a humorous card, then this shop also provides. And if you happen to need some wrapping paper and all the accessories as well, then what do you know, this shop also stocks all of the things that will fulfil your wrapping needs! A small, cute shop, prices are higher than at your normal Clinton's, but you certainly do not mind paying that for a card of quality!
5	The Bay Tree Company is a beautiful little card and gift shop on Hannover street. The shop is painted fresh white and it has quirky little handmade decorations displayed in the window and dotted all around the shop. I popped in last week just as they were closing up. I'd set out that morning to buy my friend a birthday card as I was going to her birthday party that night and I completely forgot until the last minute. Thankfully I was right next to Bay Tree so I quickly dashed in. Even though it was clear they were closing up they still didn't mind me browsing and I felt under no pressure to hurry up and leave which is a good thing as the choice was huge, they have an excellent selection of cards. The staff were very friendly and it gave the shop a nice relaxed atmosphere.I ended up buying a beautiful glittery cupcake card for my friend which she loved and it wasn't that expensive either. I'll definitely be popping back in.
