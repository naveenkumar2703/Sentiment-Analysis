1	I went to this location in hopes to get my new IPhone to another carrier. They guy told me he could do it told me it will be done in 4hrs at 7pm. I drove 25 miles 1 way and he tells me sorry I couldnt get to it. I asked for a refund and he said no Ill have it ready tomorrow at 10am. This being TODAY! I just got back after having to drive yet another 50 miles round trip to and from this worthless place. They did not fix it they didnt even attempt to fix it. The firmware had not been changed NOTHING. He gave me my $ back but over all very unpleased. The Hispanic guy looked stoned and the the Middle eastern guy was completly clueless. I completly felt as if they were trying to steal my phone. They had misplaced it and acted like they didnt know where it was. i said Im calling the police they magically found it 2 seconds later. This place is absolutly not worth going to please Consumer BEWARE!!!!
1	Worst service ever . I took to get my ipad fixed for LCD and they took a week to replace ,when they told me it would only take 48 hrs at the most . After they gave it back to me the screen was cracked now which wasn't there before . They charged another $60 and took 3 additional days  . These guys  broke my screen  while replacing the LCD  . Bad service, they took too long,  liars .dont go here
1	Drop my phone off to be repaired, I prepaid for the repairs.. should've been done within a day I called and called and called 2 months of Complaining they gave me a loaner phone that had pornography on it. I never did get my back my phone!
