3	Like a beacon in the still dark early dawn that held promise of filling an empty stomach.  What I had planned on having for breakfast had turned into something ugly and rather than grab something else I decided to head out and see what I found.I don't now what their hours are but it seems like any time I am around they are open. The building was originally a Taco Bell, of which a shiny new one is across the street.  I chose to take my food with me this time, not sure a white guy is welcome in that neighborhood before the sun is up.    The place is worn but clean.  I got a potato, bacon, egg burrito that I almost was able to finish for $3.75.  It was OK but not really tasty, like it could have used something but I wasn't about to test their salsa.By being 2.6, mostly because of the lack of much flavor, it barely made the three scale
4	Ok I know there are probably upwards a thousand 'bertos restaurants in the Valley, but Hilbertos is one of the best I've been to. It's really close to where I work so I go there almost every morning as my morning ritual for breakfast. The ham, egg, and cheese breakfast burrito is simple, but amazing all at the same time. It blows McDonald's and Burger King's burritos out of the water! I usually get the green sauce to go with it. The red sauce is good too, but I like green better. The service there is quick and to the point so you can get in and get out really quick. The building used to be a Taco Bell so there is plenty of seating. I'm usually on the go so I don't eat there. Very good restaurant!
2	Breakfast burrito left me feeling naseous all day. Very greasy yet dry meat..weird combo.People are nice and it is clean so I guess that's good?
1	The windows and doors are boarded up. Apparently, it is closed!There is no way to get any food. So, I would skip this one.
