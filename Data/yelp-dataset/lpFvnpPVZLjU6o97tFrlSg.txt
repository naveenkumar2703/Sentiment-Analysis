4	Quick service when we needed the glass in a window replaced, and they did a great job.
5	Recommended by a friend.I took a window frame that was badly bent in to see what they could do.After taking it to 2 other places who told me it was far too bent to be repaired, I expected them to say the same thing.To my amazement, they said it would take some time, but would in fact DO THE WORK to get the frame back into shape and put a piece of glass in it.From now on, I will ONLY go to Glendale Glass, these guys saved me over $400.00 by NOT having the entire window replaced.
5	Great company. Gave me a quote, came out and measured. Quote was the same,ordered glass , replaced. Excellent work and service was great! My front window had a bb shot thru a duel payne. They installed using the same frame and sved me alot of money.
