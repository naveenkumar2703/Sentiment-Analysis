She told me they had a special on hot dog rolls, 2 for $5.00.  However, i asked for 2 Jalapeno rolls and she said they were still cooking.  I said OK, i will be back in about 5 min. When i came back again i ordered 2 jalapeno rolls.  She gave me my order and a coupon for next time. But, when i got where i was going and opened the bag i had 2 plain hot dog rolls.   I did not take them back really it is not a big thing. But, it would have been nice. Since i like the spicy. Other than that ,fabulous!
5	So, so, so good!  This is my favorite place to get a pretzel.  Warm, buttery and delicious.  I try not to think about how many calories must be in these things for them to taste that good, but I think we all know a pretzel isn't health food.  If you're going to have one, why not have a good one?  I have tried a few of their different flavors.  they have all been good, but I always just end up going back to the original because it's just soft, warm, and yummy.  There is also a Wetzel's Pretzels in the mall.  They are good too, but I prefer Auntie Anne's.  They taste a bit fresher to me.  Go try one.  :)

1	Don't go here if your looking for friendly fast service. Waited over 10 min for someone to make a pepperoni pretzel. Staff making pretzel complained about making pretzel and very rude. I got tired of waiting so I got a refund and went to another pretzel stand.
