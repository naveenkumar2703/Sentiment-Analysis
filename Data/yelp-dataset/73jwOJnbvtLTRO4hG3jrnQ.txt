5	What a great place to have your car properly repaired after a collision.  Tim, the manager, is awesome.  He personally reviews your repair work needed with you and answers all of your questions.  Tim works well with the insurance companies and keeps you up to date with your car's repair process.  On the day that I was called to pick up my car, I was amazed.  He stayed at the shop an hour later due to late repairs and my pick up time.  He  had a driver waiting for me at the car rental business ready to pick me up and take me to Andy's Collision Center on Cave Creek Road.  When I arrived, the car was spotless inside and outside and the repair work was impeccable, not a flaw in sight.  Well done and may the business of many clients flow your way!  Andy's Collision Center is so deserving of the many more praises that are sure to come.  Thank you for taking the time to care about the repair work of my vehicle and the personal communication that makes your body repair shop so very special.
5	Andy's took amazing care of my vehicle.  From detailed auto body work, fair estimates to sensitivity for how long I had a rental vehicle, Tim and his team of technicians went above and beyond!  Highly recommend!!
5	We had a great experience here.  If you find yourself in the unfortunate position where  you need an auto body shop after a collision, I highly recommend Andy's!  We have used them twice (don't judge), and each time have appreciated the time they took to thoroughly explain the problems and what our vehicles would need, including costs of parts and labor.  They made getting and returning a rental car simple.  They're very kind and respectful, and do a great job at what they do - both of our vehicles came out looking as "good as new."
