5	This place is great.  The staff is VERY helpful for the novice.  More importantly for me they never made me feel like an idiot no matter how many questions I have.The recommendations for me were spot on.David is an awesome guy too.  He really has put his money where his mouth is in supporting our Armed Forces.
4	Great selection and help. Also nice place to have a smoke and hang out and BYOB.
4	Great shop! I found this place when googled a shop in the area. When I arrived I was greeted by the west host director, Brad, and he showed me around and suggested some great smokes. There overall selection is great and the customer service was exceptional. I enjoyed a cup of coffee and a cigar and have been returning since because of the customer service I received. The only reason it is not five star is the pricing is a bit higher than I am used to, but not too high considering the brotherhood that is present at the speakeasy. Highly recommend this place, I am glad I found it and it is worth the extra 50cents I pay for a cigar. Keep up the good work!
5	First, they have an awesome selection of cigars - everything from $4 Perdomos to $20 high-end Gurkhas and everything in between.  If they don't have it, you probably don't need or want it.Second - they have military lines of cigars, made by Oliva.  I can't speak for all of them, but the Army cigar I had was one of the best mild smokes I'd had in a while.  I'll make a point of picking them up every time I'm in the area.Third - staff was friendly, helpful, and not pushy at all.All in all, this is a perfect place to sit down, have a cigar, and watch sports or news.  I'd be in there every day if I lived in the area.  As it is, I'm going to make it a go-to place when we're in town.
