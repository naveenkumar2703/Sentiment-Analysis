1	Recieved a door hanger with a 20% discount. Went to the restuarant on Christmas eve and found it closed. As this was a holiday eve I let it go. Tried the following MOnday....Closed! Tried Jan 6 2012 and Closed! Every time I went to this place, it was closed.....Will not try again!!!!!!!!
1	= = = = = = CLOSED = = = = = =It doesn't matter how it was because this place came & went all in the month of January!  Apparently they didn't have a nickel's worth of start-up capital!     :-O
4	Too bad they didn't make it. Went on new years eve, but there were only a few people and loads of food out. It  almost seems like  a cursed  location, as so many business come and go. When they opened, they started to tear that part of town and country down and so it was a construction road that lead to their business, which might have sewm to many as in accesible. The service was good, so was the food. I wanted to go back to find them closed. Feel sorry for them.
