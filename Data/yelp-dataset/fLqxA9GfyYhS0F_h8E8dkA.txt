1	I went here to exchange a part (oil drain plug) that I purchased from another location that did not fit my car at it should. It turned out the package contained the incorrect plug (from the manufacturer). When returning the part, the guy at the counter asked the supervisor what to do with the part I was returning.... He said 'Re-sell it. We have to for inventory'. So you're going to try to sell it to someone else knowing it is wrong??? That's horrible.
5	Friendly and efficient service. The clerk found  similar but less expensive battery for me without my asking.
1	Rude and  not very helpful staff! I went to buy a  break light boult and asked the clerk if it was easy to instal... Guy said "I have no idea" after that he turned around and left
5	One of many new stores and it's pretty big for a non hub. Reasonable pricing, and friendly staff.  I come here since it's right by the house.  Never left unsatisfied or without the part I need. They can order what you need if it's not in stock. I like to check out the closeout rack because sometimes there's hot wheels cars, microfiber clothes, & shop towels that I can't seem to buy enough of..  Plus you can find things you never realized you needed on close out specials.. Grab it while you can and save it for later.
5	I have been to this location a couple of times and both times the guys were SUPER helpful. I was making small purchases and they treated me like their best customer.
