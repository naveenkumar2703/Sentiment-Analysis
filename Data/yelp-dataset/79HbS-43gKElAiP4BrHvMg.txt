5	I love the new downtown location. When I first started vaping, I came here and had no idea about ejuices, vaping or anything else. The guys here are very knowledgable and made me feel comfortable. They have a TON of ejuices that you can try for free, and pretty decent prices.
5	Amazing service! Lost mine in a move and Dana set me up in seconds! Awesome place with great selection.
5	Best vape store in Phoenix.  Great prices, great service & nobody pressures you to buy shit you don't need or try 884 flavored before you pick one.  And this is my fav e cig I've owned... Among at least 10.
1	I went to this location three times, bought about 60 bucks of assorted items each time. I went today to return my an ego battery that stopped working. The guy tried to tell me that it looked like the top seperated from the body which it had not. He told me that I could try the manufacturer warranty. So instead of trying to make it right he tried to sell me a new one. Wow! So I had to pay to park, to listen to this guy tell me a bs story about this battery "probably" came seperated. I have been buying these batteries for the last year I know when they break and when they are defective. I'm going to Extreme Vapor from now on where they have always taken care of any issues I've had.
5	Im a regular customer at this location. Felt welcomed the first time I entered. Every time I go I have a good time just hanging out and vaping. Marcus, Dana, and Steven are always in a good mood. Very easy going and down to earth. Their prices are spot on where they should be. From ejuice to batteries. And from starter kits to high end mods. Authentic mod by the way. No clone mods. Plus they have a rewards cards that's saved me a couple times when I needed ejuice between pay checksBest shop in phoenix by far!
