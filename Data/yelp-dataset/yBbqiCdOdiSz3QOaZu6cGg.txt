4	While shopping at Wal*Mart in Laveen today, the smell of the bread baking in this place made me hungry, so I dropped in.  I enjoyed an excellent 6" sandwich AND a bowl of good Cream of Broccoli soup, BOTH, for $4.33 including the tax!  Can you imagine?  This place is the killer deal!
5	NOTE- 5 stars for fast food joint, not the Capital Grill.This Subway experience was fast, accurate, and no fuss. (1/21/11)This Subway is busy and efficient.  I enjoyed an excellent turkey sub add bacon with an assortment of toppings and they made it with excellent fresh ingredients.  If you need a meal fast and on the cheap, you can't beat this.  I was in and out fast during a busy lunch rush.
4	Always clean :)
4	hello yelp friends I feel so out of touch as I've been working a lot, and I've missed during the regular buffets with the Buffy bandits... Rand and Company. But here's a little dose of yelping more for me than you I'm sure. I like Subway because I always know what I can expect. And I always enjoy it about the same. I've never noticed any glaring difference between the service of food or any of the other factors that I take notice of with respects to writing a review. I ordered the five dollar cold cuts with all my favorite toppings and I won't sit down in record time as I was extremely hungry after long days work.
3	same food as anyother subway..same service as any other fast food place.
1	Staff were completely uninterested. Bread was kinda soggy (on the outside) like it was close to something steaming, and one of the cucumbers were moldy/rotten. Won't be going back. EVER.
4	No complaints. Quiet place, lot of chairs and good service. Just a little unclean, typical of Walmart.
