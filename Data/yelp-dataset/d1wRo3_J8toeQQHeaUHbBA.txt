5	I have used PC Cops several times in the past few months. What I like is the solution process begins with a very structured, logical approach to solving the immediate problem. This eliminates wasting any time on small talk or "helter/skelter trial and error" techniques practiced by other companies. Also, they use your existing equipment and maximize your computer system, without trying to sell you additional hardware, software, etc. I would have to be a fool if I called anyone other than PC Cops.
5	PC Cops are GREAT! The response time is fantastic. They really know what they are doing and they do it fast, complete & precise!  Thank you for always being there for me. When you run a business with your computer, it's nice to know these guys have your back.
5	PC Cops are the best!  Mario from PC Cops will be there for you for all of your business IT needs, he is the man! I highly recommend PC Cops to all business owners for their IT needs.  Don't wait until it's too late, call PC Cops today!
5	PC- Cops has been my technology company for almost a year and I'm extremely thankful for the awesome service and response time anytime I need somthing done.  I highly recommend PC Cops for any and all technology needs!
5	The PC Cops team went above and beyond to help me with me website issues. I must admit, I am a bit of a pain to deal with due to my procrastination issues. However, Mario was so patient with me helping me through the whole process and even my changes. He was more than helpful with suggestions and creating mock ups to help me get a real feel for the site before going live. Best of all he spent the time to educate me on the technology.I would gladly recommend Mario and the PC Cops for any computer maintenance, help with transferring storage to cloud, computer glitches (i.e. getting all your technology to play well with others) and website help. Best of all they speak so you don't have to be a techy to understand them.-Thanks so much, Dr. L
