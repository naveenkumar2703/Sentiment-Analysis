4	this is your normal QT as you can see I am a big fan, nothing real speacle about this one but know what to expect when I pull in.
5	Always feel safe here...I think the Police use this location as an unofficial sub-station.I can't tell you how many times I have pulled in and seen the police, the sheriff or SWAT teams. Even though it seems kinda strange to see them in their gear and then I look over their shoulders to see...sheep...Staff is always friendly and helpful. I have asked for calorie counts on several of their prepared food items and they are glad to get the info for me.It's clean on the inside and out. Pumps always work, very few broken ones can be found---if ever.
4	I really have enjoyed the QT Kitchens but the nearest one was on Peoria Avenue. Now that this has become a kitchen makes it even better. The wait was a bit longer but I will chalk that up to being new with the kitchen. The Grilled Cheese that I ordered was good but the crust was hard to chew. Still love the different varieties they have to offer.
4	They just upgraded!!! Kitchen is here now:)But that also removed my ice cream- pistachio:( and they still dont have the new flavors for teas like the caribbean that are on other new qts!! Still waiting and hoping that some teas will be added more!
