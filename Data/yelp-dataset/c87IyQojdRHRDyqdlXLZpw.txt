5	Really. I can't say enough good thing about this company. It's a wonderful idea that every dog and cat lover should join. I had great experience with the owner of this company who is dedicated in loving our best friends. I was out of country for 3 weeks. Imaging if we are the pets that don't get to see the world and stay home without the care or love. It will drive us crazy. This service will arrange the best host for your pets, so you don't have to worry about their condition. Great services for our best friends!
5	PupTent is a new and exciting alternative alternative to pet boarding. I have known Karri for some time now and she is a trustworthy professional. I can't imagine ever letting my dog stay at a traditional boarding facility knowing that for less money he could be staying with a loving family. This is a much needed option for those who take long trips or require extended hospital stays.
5	The Problem:The idea of taking Fido to the "kennel" freaks us out almost as it does Fido himself. We know that Fido is going to get the most basic of needs met at "the kennel", but we also know that he thinks it sucks. We know that he isn't happy about being there. He remembers the last stay at the kennel and maybe that's why he whines and whimpers as we drive up to the place? Maybe that's why he has to practically be dragged into the kennel? The Solution: PupTent Alternative Pet BoardingAfter leaving Fido with a PupTent participant you might have to drag him back home when you come to pick him up! He just spent several days being loved and pampered by someone who was able to enjoy him and care for him and love him almost as much as you do!To learn more about how PupTent can make your doggy a happy camper when you are away see this quick video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0o5FCkCsvY
