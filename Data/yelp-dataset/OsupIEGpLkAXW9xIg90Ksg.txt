4	this is a great little greggs to go to in the st james centre.It has a great selection of food like bakery and other sorts of food like crisps,wraps and others.Its a good quality of food as it tastes beatiful.
2	Okay I will admit a Greggs sausage roll is up there with Irn Bru and McDonald's as a brilliant hangover cure.But that's it.Greggs is where 17 year old mums take their many children to feed them with sausage rolls and Coca Cola. Here's a thought: fruit! Vegetables! Try feeding them to your child instead of Greggs processed fatty food. Rant over.
4	I'm trying to save up some cash so it's beginning to be with worrying regularity that I find myself in here. As much as I loathe Greggs, there is something about their fatty, greasy, lukewarm filth that makes me keep coming back, and back, and back. It's these life-shortening savouries, rather than the mediocre sarnies I used to prefer, that ensure my begrudged but repeated custom.That, and the maple pecan slice, a real diamond in the rough.
3	Oh Greggs. I owe you one.I've lost count of the amount of times this place has sorted me out. It's hangover food essentially, but damn good hangover food!! They have brilliant sandwiches that are all made fresh daily, and their cakes are yummy. Their sausage rolls are what save my life.To be honest, this isn't one of my preferred branches.It's in the St James' centre, so everyone watches you. I don't like the St james' centre and as much as I love Greggs, I avoid this one!
