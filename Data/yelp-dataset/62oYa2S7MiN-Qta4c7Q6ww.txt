4	Great nail salon located at the end of the building beside of Safeway.  Excellent prices and everyone in the salon does a great job.  I happen to be partial to Jimmy and Tommy!
5	Smallish salon with lots of personal attention. I like that they use high quality products.  My pedicures last until it's time to have it redone.
1	Was a walk In at opening on a Sunday morning, the place was completely empty except for one employee.  The BF was treating me to a pedi and the little ones to painted finger and toe nails....I'm all for efficient use of time, but both girls had nails and toes painted and my SPA pedicure were all completed in 37 minutes! By the SAME employee.  My favorite part of a pedicure is the massage, the tech literally rubbed each foot haphazardly with one hand for 3 minutes! In addition to the cold water (which she warmed up upon request).  When my BF returned to pay she charged him $32 for a pedicure that was originally quoted $23!!! Not sure if this was because he used a credit card, the place has numerous signs posted inside that they prefer cash.... Nice ambiance :(There's a reason this place was empty, too bad because it's so close to home.
