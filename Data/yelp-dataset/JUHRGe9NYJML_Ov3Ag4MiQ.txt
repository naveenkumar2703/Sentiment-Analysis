5	My husband & I are firm believers on how massages can help our health. While there we went to Izumi The Fountian of Youth and I have to give Robin Andrews a five star! Her room is beautiful and relaxing. My husband has had problems with his kidney's, and also cycles alot she knew exactly what spots to work on and knew products to use to help him. She really knows what she is doing. I can't wait to go back and have her do a facial on me. She is very professional and love the environment.
5	Robin Andrews has been my massage therapist for several years now.  I am a dental hygienist and have had many back and neck issues.  Robin is very thorough and knowledgable in many forms of massage therapy.  She is also an  aesthetician and master hair designer.  Robin just makes things better and I always look foreward to visiting her.
5	I have received a facial, massage and hair cut from Robin and all three were wonderful.  Robin has great attention to detail and is great at customizing any service.  She is easy to talk to and I feel very comfortable as her client.  With the amount of knowledge she has about skin care I know I'm going to get the best!  Thank you!
5	Izumi the fountain of youth is truly the fountain of youth.  My first experience there was age reversal. I went in with an old achy body, a migraine, dehydrated wrinkly skin and feeling depressed.  I left headache free, plump moist rejuvenated skin like a 20 year old.
