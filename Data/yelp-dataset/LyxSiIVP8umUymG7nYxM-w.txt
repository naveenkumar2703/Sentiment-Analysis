5	I absolutely love this Armani Exchange! The location is great also. I am a regular at this store - where I usually purchase my clothes because Armani has clothes that fit me perfect where I do not have to get them tailored. The store usually changes what they have in stock frequently, to keep a variety of clothing for both men and women. The guys that work there are just wonderful - they are very polite and friendly. They always grab my clothes and take them to the dressing room, because they already know that I will be purchasing some stuff! I recommended this Armani Exchange to my friends who love fashion and trendy clothing.
5	LOVE this store!  I shop there for myself, my husband, for gifts - everything.  The staff is always friendly and helpful, whether I'm there with my kids in tow/flip flops/t-shirt or whether I am a bit more dressed up.  It's nice to be treated well as a customer regardless of what you're wearing and the same can't be said about most shops in Scottsdale.On my last visit, Everett helped me find a work wardrobe for my husband.  He was so patient, knowledgeable, and friendly.   Every single item I purchased fit my husband perfectly and looked amazing.   I don't visit the Quarter without stopping in, especially when they have a sale ;)
5	I am so sad they closed this store.  This was so much better than the one in Fashion Square mall.  Please, bring it back.  I'll buy more dresses!
