5	Agreed!  We love Dr. Vu!  He was recommended to us by the pediatrician at the hospital when my daughter was born almost a year ago.  He has been wonderful!  Always very attentive and great with my daughters!
5	I love Dr. Vu!  I delivered my son Julien at St. Rose Hospital and I was originally going to take him to a woman up near us in the SW, but because I delivered at Siena campus in Henderson, she asked Dr. Vu to come check up on Julien because of the drive!!!  Well, I am so glad I had a chance to meet him because he cared so much for me and my son while we were in the hospital.  When I found out that he also has a SW location (FYI 6070 S. Rainbow Blvd, Suite 10 Las Vegas, NV 89118) I was so happy to make the switch.  My son is only 3 months old, but in the few visits that I've had to Dr. Vu (including immunizations and circumcisions) I really trust him!
5	Dr. Vu is awesome!!  He took care of my son after I delivered him and was so compassionate with our concerns.  You can tell he really loves children and has an awesome bedside manner.  Our son was going to have a procedure done and we were really scared of what it entailed.  Dr. Vu rearranged his schedule and came to the hospital first thing in the morning to address our concerns.  Not once did we ever feel rushed with him and he answered all of our questions in terms we could understand.  I love the fact that he remembered us from our previous visit and asked us questions pertaining to our last visit.
5	I was recommended here by a dr i love at goodnight pediatrics (emergency 24 hour pediatrician). I have taken my kids here ever since and been very happy with our treatment. We lost our insurance due to a job change and all i pay is $50 per visit!!! Plus the doctors are wonderful. They also have completely separate sick and well waiting rooms. I would definitely recommend these folks, especially for the uninsured. I wish more doctors cared about those of us without insurance.
5	I love this pediatricians office! My hubby and i are self employed and dont have insurance, these folks let us pay out of pocket and its only $55 per visit. Dr vu is caring, knowledgable and great with kids. I also love the nurse practitioner. They get me in & outquickly, are always polite, and the last two times I had to get my kids in quickly, they scheduled me for THAT DAY.Also there are separate waiting rooms for sick/well patients, and toys and books for the kids in the waiting room. Five stars!
2	I have been going to Anthem Pediatrics since my first son was born 3 years ago and they were in another location, near Seven Hills.  I have to say that I would have rated it 5 stars back then, but since they have moved to their new location on Horizon Ridge (closer to Green Valley area), service has taken a nosedive.  Dr Vu and Dr King are both very nice doctors, WHEN you actually get to see them, which is HARDLY EVER!  They always send Physician Assitant STUDENTS or their NP instead of seeing you themselves.  It is a big time waster if it is a student because then they have to have their work checked and the doctor then re examines your kid.  I miss the days of seeing doctors only, as that is what we pay the big bucks for.
2	I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. My family recently moved from Seattle to LV and Anthem Peds was recommended to us. I've taken my daughter here for her one year,15 month well baby visit and a last minute scheduled appointment. All three times I had to wait over 20 minutes PAST my scheduled appointment time to even get called back. Our very recent appointment was at 11:30 and we were finally called back around 12:05!! We weren't even late. We checked in right at 11:30.The nurse who takes the temp, weight and measurements could be more friendly. She gave me the impression and made it seem obvious that she is unhappy with her job. Each visit there wasn't a simple "hello" or even a smile when she called us back. My last peds office was wonderful. Everyone had a smile and interacted with the kids. This place was the complete opposite.Dr, Vu is great although the two times we saw him, I did feel rushed.  He came in looked over my daughter, asked a few questions and stood up to leave. He didn't even ask if I had questions!! Before he ran out the door, I stopped him and asked him a question. He stood there as if I was wasting his time! Dr, King is really great. She was very helpful and addressed all my concerns. I've switched doctors after this last visit. I'm sorry but waiting 35 minutes after my scheduled appt time is plain crappy!! No one even apologized or acknowledged I waited that long! This is by far the worst experience I've had with a doctors office and I've seen lots of them.
2	I am becoming less and less fond of Anthem Pediatrics, and their billing/records department.My daughter was born on 12/31/12, I had not picked a pediatrician, and Dr. Vu was the pediatrician on call that night at St. Rose hospital. He was friendly, informative, and my husband liked him. I decided on him for our pediatrician.I do agree that the doctors there are pretty illusive, and I have seen the nurse more than I have seen Dr. Vu himself.But, on to my annoyance with their billing department. Today, 7/25/13, I get a bill from them for $350. For the dates 12/31 and 1/1.... yes, seven months ago, from when we were in the hospital.They have been submitting this to my insurance, and every time they do, I get notice from my insurance. AND EVERY TIME, my insurance tells me that I owe them, the provider $0.00.The insurance has also stated that appropriate codes need to be submitted.Now, my insurance covered my birth, and my daughter's first two days of life.I have written a letter that will be sent out tomorrow 7/26/13 telling Anthem Pediatrics that I will not be paying this bill until I get denial from my insurance company.  At this time, I feel that I have no other choice but to withdraw my daughter from the care of Anthem Pediatrics and Dr. Vu. I have asked for her records to be released.I see here a parent that says that her and her husband don't have insurance, and pay $55 for an office visit. I find it funny that we are in the same boat, and we pay *******$100****** every time we step into that office!8/31/2013Still NO RESPONSE FROM ANTHEM PEDIATRICS.Still don't have my daughter's records.9/12/13I get a phone call from a "Kerri", who works at the rainbow office. She says that my insurance, has given them denial over the phone. Sooo....she has denial, but I don't...? I will handle that with my insurance company.Kerri says that they would send me a discounted bill, along with the woman from the insurance representative that she spoke with.9/20/13I receive the updated invoice from Anthem Pediatrics,***but no name of the insurance rep. that Kerri spoke to, **or my daughter's records.10/2/13I finally have my daughter's records, after two months (asked on 7/26/13) ......Seriously.
2	My son was a patient of Dr. Vu, and we did see Dr. King once when Vu was out of the office.  Both docs are very friendly, but from my experience, Dr Vu spent very little time with his patients.  The past 4 appointments we had, the wait was long 20-30 min each time.  What makes the visit even LONGER is that a medical student usually visits first, gives your child a full exam, and then you have to wait again for the real doc to visit. When Dr Vu does visit, it's lightning speed.  The med student spends WAY more time asking you questions than the real doc, which is disappointing.  Bad experience on our most recent visit, I went in thinking my 2 yr old son had croup, told that to the med student and Dr Vu.  Med student kind of believed me, Dr Vu told me it was just very bad allergies and to give him Children's Allegra.  2 nights later, I rush my son to Urgent Care at 3am (Goodnight Pediatrics, love them! A++++) and sure enough, my son had croup.  Won't be back to Anthem Pediatrics....
3	Um..what happened?!  I never really have had to wait for my appointments but the last two times the doctor was running late. Today was an appointment which was rescheduled from a previous day. That previous day, the wait was an hour long. At least I was told up front but I really wish they would have called so I didn't drive up there for nothing. I couldn't wait for an hour (and you know it would have been longer) with my three kids in a waiting room that was packed.  Well I was at the office today for an hour and a half. I didn't even see the doc, I saw the nurse, which I was fine with since they were just well checks. I really hope this is not going to be a common occurrence, otherwise I will be looking for a new doctor for my kids.
5	I left a much larger pediatric practice to come to Anthem Pediatrics and I am so glad I did. I rarely have to wait long once we are checked in. Granted, in the peak cold and flu season there is usually a bit of a wait, but I have never waited hours like some of the reviews have stated. My older daughter has asthma and it developed very young (which I understand to be not common) and it was missed by her former pediatrician...or should I say the entire practice since we never got to see the same doctor twice. After much frustration we found Dr. Vu, he got her on preventative medication and is very attentive to my questions and our family medical needs. Dr. King is also nice and the nurse practitioner has always been very professional with us. It is so nice to be at a smaller practice and see the same doctor when we come in. Dr. Vu remembers my girls each time we are there and talks to them. All of them listen to my concerns as a mom, which is super important. I have never felt pressured into unneeded medications and Dr. Vu was very accommodating to a delayed shot schedule. As long as my schedule is forgiving, I can almost always get same day sick visits if I call in the morning. If I call in the afternoon sometimes they have openings but usually I can get in first thing the next morning. Well checks are easy to schedule as long the parent remembers to do it in advance like most practices work. I do agree that the front staff lacks and someone with more enthusiasm would be nice. But I am going their for the doctor, not for the receptionist.
5	Dr. Vu is fantastic. Our kids are 6 and 4 now and have been going to this office since they were babies. Dr. Vu is very patient and asks many questions during a visit. Comfy waiting room chairs and a TV to entertain the kids. Well checkups have reasonable wait times, which is nice with both parents working full time. At another office I used to have to take a full day off to take my kid to the doctor. If you have sick ones you can get in, but there will be a wait. Normally we see the Physicians Assistant on sick days and Nicole is very helpful. We will stay at this office as long as they are around :)
