4	We use their services at our office in Northern CA. They send a woman to give us our flu shots every year. Had no problems with payment or scheduling. The biggest problem is not crying when someone tries to put a needle in my arm. I try to tough it out, since I get my flu shot at work, and I don't want to appear weak with my coworkers around... but I usually end up asking to hold someone's hand.They lose a star for not providing stickers and suckers to us when we're done; like my doctor does when I get a shot.
1	Worst company ever!!! Do not use them..totally unreliable and unresponsive. Do not respond to phone calls or emails. Shocked they are still in business. Stay away!!! TB
