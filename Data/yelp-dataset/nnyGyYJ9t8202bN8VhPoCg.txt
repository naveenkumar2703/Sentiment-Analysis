3	This place is off the strip so the prices are better here.  Has everything you need to take to the hotel.  Local types here and friendly service.  Not a lot of transients hanging around like other places in the area.
5	Drug dealers aren't perfect. Thankfully, there's Walgreens.#DrinkTussin
3	I normally don't come to Walgreens to buy anything as they are more pricey then Walmart, but I do like that this is very convenient and close to my house. The times I've gone the store is clean, organized and quiet. Never really had a problem finding the item that I went in to buy.
3	Honestly, I think this store is in need of some tlc and a few tweeks. I came here to scour the leftover's from Christmas.   I am the first to admit that I spend more money on perfumes than any other beauty product. And it just so happens that I love the scent of Jovan white musk and Elizabeth Taylor's  Passion. I scored both gift sets for 50% off and I ended up paying a little over $20 .Score!
