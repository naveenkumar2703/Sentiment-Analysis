4	I used to go to this bar years ago when it was Marleys. I went back recently and (I'm glad to say), it was exactly as I remembered it. It really is a bar, not a club. Its a little diveish, but thats all part of the charm. Friendly bartenders, the drinks were about average price but well made. I had several three olives vodka and soda, $5 each, pitchers of draft beer were about $5 as well. There was karaoke, which the whole bar was into. The atmosphere was very welcoming, and I think if I went there a couple more times everyone would know me, like they all seemed to know eachother. Clean bathrooms, small single stall types. Parking as easy and directly in front of the bar. This place is relaxing and fun, I'll definitely be back!
