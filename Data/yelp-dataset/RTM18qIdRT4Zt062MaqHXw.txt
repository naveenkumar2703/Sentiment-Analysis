2	Another fast food place located in the food court a Meadows Mall. My kid like this place so I let him give it a go. To me everything looks dried out & very pastey sauces. They no longer have crispy beef and the other stuff just looks weird so my son chose ORANGE Chicken w/ half noodles half rice.Whats up with the Fried rice w/NO pork? Yuk! I'm NOT a fan I'd rather go to Pick Up Stix at least its made to order.
2	I stopped by last week for the free Tangy Jumbo Shrimp with an internet coupon.  The restaurant was located in the Meadows Mall in Las Vegas.  I got 3 shrimp with the tails on mixed with red bell peppers and green beans.  I would not pay for the Tangy Jumbo Shrimp.
3	Good solid Panda Express.  It is in the Meadows Mall.  There is never too long of a line.  When I walked up and ordered a Panda bowl with vegetables side.  They made the veggies fresh while I waited.  Then I added the peppercorn shrimp.  I wish I go more than 6 shrimp with the veggies that come with the peppercorn shrimp, but my whole meal was a total of 270 calories.  It was filling and tasted good.  I enjoyed it.  When I am not on a diet, I enjoy the cream cheese ragoons.  The mall is right across from my work.  I have no complaints about this place.
