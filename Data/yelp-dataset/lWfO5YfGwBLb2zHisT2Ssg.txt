5	Best pricing for water I have found.  If you buy more than 20 gallons.  It is $0.20 per gallon!
5	Stopped in for the first time and was so impressed by the cleanliness, service, and the wide selection of bottles, ice cream, candy, and other items. I bought 24 one gallon jugs for only $0.99 a piece and my first fill-up was free. They had a bunch of carts I could use to bring my water to my car and the friendly woman working even helped me fill when there were no customers at the counter. In an age where good service is hard to come by, it was refreshing to see that places like this still exist. I'm definitely a regular customer at this location after today.
1	Where is the negative star review????  Such Bullshit!!!!!  Filled up water at 9pm last Sunday... Put in 8 quarters, only got about, 3 gallons and about 1/12 of a gallon!!  F...U!!!!!! Water and ice!!!!!  Never going there again, anyone else...don't go there for water!!!!    Robbery!!!!!!   Garbage!!!!
1	AVOID THIS PLACE - WATER FILTERS HAVE NOT BEEN CHANGED SINCE PLACE OPENED.  WATER TASTES LIKE OUT OF THE TAP!!! ITS DISGUSTING!I am completely opposed writing a bad review and it really takes alot for me to do this, but this place has not changed their filters and has not maintained their system since place opened up years ago.  I know this for a fact.   The water machines at Albertson's next door are only .75 cents for 5 gallons and their water tastes a million times better.  go to water and ice for ice cream and candy but for the love of clean water this place is not recommended one bit.
5	We are Cali natives & love us some Thrifty ice cream. They have the good ol' chocolate malted crunch, and even better, the original Thrifty prepacks! Now I know back in Cali, the tubs run less than $4 a tub, so at $5.95 (or around there, forgot price) it's a little high... But driving to Cali is a little more expensive! We haven't seen these tubs in Az, in many years. Thank you for carrying these!
