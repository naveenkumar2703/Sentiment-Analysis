5	Good food, good service...FAST!
5	One of my favorite choices. What can beat five bucks for a pizza ready to go when you walk in? The cheesy bread and wings are a solid choice too.Not to long ago my wife was having a rough day. I wanted to surprise her when I came home from work. I stopped by little Caesars, picked up a pizza, then picked up a movie and spent the night cuddling with her on the couch.
4	Prompt service. They *smile* too. Can't beat a $5 pizza on the go. I'm grateful their pizza doesn't drip fatty oil like a Papa John's pizza. The Italian cheesy bread is addictive. Carry out only. The Italian cheesy bread could come down in price *just a tad*. They were experimenting with these new flavors for chicken wings. We tried the lemon pepper flavor and the wings were a bit on the cold side. Also very bland for the picture they put up on their menu. They look better than what they actually taste.
