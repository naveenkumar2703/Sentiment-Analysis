2	Let you know right away!! I have never been fond of AT&T!!! So this review may be bias!!!!We have been here about four times, actually as I am writing this review! My wife is there now replacing her phone. Service can be tough at times! My biggest problem is you can call AT&T and talk to them on the phone, when you get to a location. They don't offer you the same deals!! Always some excuses!! Always want to sell you something you don't need. Wife goes there now without me, because I won't take their crap. When I have a chance to opt out of their, I'm gone!!!
1	Emily was beyond rude and had no interest in helping me Purchase a phone. I walked into this store excited to purchase my first iPhone and set up with AT&T, but received nothing but a bad attitude by an employee who obviously doesn't like their job. The lack of customer service I received made me uneasy so I decided to leave and set up service elsewhere. I will not be returning to this location I would rather drive out of my way and be treated with respect than to be subject to the treatment I received here again.
3	I've been to this store several times and have always had a decent experience. My most recent experience was to purchase a new SIM card as i was inheriting my husband's iPhone 5 when he upgraded to the 5S. I was upgrading from the 4S. Terry was very helpful and it was no charge!
