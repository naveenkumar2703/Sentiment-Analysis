4	Great store for the comfortable (but still stylish) shoe-minded gal or guy. I'm a fan of Clarks and Privos (soleassage nubs for your comfort) but I don't want to pay regular prices ($79-$99 on average). I've got high arches so I cannot wear cheap shoes without any support. (I still wear my Doc Martens shoes but I wear my inserts so I can walk comfortably. And I do the same with my Aerosoles shoes too.) The selection is great here and the average shoe price is about $49.99. I love the stylish pumps in different colors other than black and brown, like burgundy. I especially like the oh-so-cute mary jane heeled pumps. The higher end brand of Clarks is "Artisan."  There is a line that is sold on QVC, called "Bendables"- but I've seen a few pairs here, too. If I had my choice, I'd get all my career shoes here. There are sooooo many cute styles here. It's not just for the office, but for casual wear, like traveling (like the Privo styles).The aisles may seem small since, usually when I am at my size checking shoes out, I've got to move for other people who pass by (let me remind you that I am petite, so if I feel crowded, it's gotta be small). There are pantyhose footie cheapies to wear, located in small boxes throughout the store. The clearance shoes are in the very back against the wall but it's slim pickings with my size. So, good luck to you. There are nice salesmen to help you. In addition, if you get the frequent shopper card, you can earn an additional discount. If you want comfortable shoes (but still looks stylish) that is reasonably priced, shop here.
