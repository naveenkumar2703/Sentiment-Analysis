5	I have two children who have attended classes here with the Matthews and all I can say is they are part of our family now and forever. My children respect,admire and truly love this family. They have given so much to us and really have helped raise our children to be dynamic indiviuals with morals and respect. I recommend them every chance I get.
5	They accepted my tiny tiger at 2.5 years! And Mrs. Matthews is awesome with the kids, especially my little one. If there is one thing I have to complain about is the class running late from time to time. In some cases understandable but most cases just a little frustrating. Not enough to take a star away.
