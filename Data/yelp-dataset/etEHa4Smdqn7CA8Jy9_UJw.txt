5	Beautiful, well crafted Italian clothes and shoes, all at fair prices. I always seem to visit while they're having their summer sale, so I usually walk away with some fantastic deals. This visit was no exception! My boyfriend treated me to an adorable blue dress, and some smokin' gold snakeskin shoes. There are only two stores in the U.S., so be sure to pay Fornarina a visit while you're in Vegas!
5	I loved Fornarina since I was in high school, and I believe this is their only store in the US?  Fornarina has such unique Italian designer footwear and clothes (although the clothes can sometimes be a bit too wild and "trendy").  I love all their 3-4 inch suede/leather boots, and I have quite a few sandals from them, all made of different material.  My favorite pair are my black boots, with a cone-heel wedge, and a pair of wood-soled sandals with metallic straps.  Their sizes are European so they run very small :D Especially jeans!  The denim is also my very favorite, I have a pair from them that always stays tight in the butt and doesn't get too saggy even after wearing and washing it weekly, it's really well made.  Everything is very fun and risque!  This Fornarina is in the Mandalay Place, kind of hidden in the back.  Very modern decor, not a lot of things out on the floor.
