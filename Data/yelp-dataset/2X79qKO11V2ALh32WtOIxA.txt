3	Small market that doesn't have that many options.  It's, however, more convenient to get a few things from there because of distance.  They have the basic essentials you might need for cooking such as spices, oils, and of course, Kimchee.  To make some standard Korean meals, you can get your ingredients here though to make more complex ones, it's best to go somewhere else.
4	I stop by here often because it's on my way home. It's convenient for things like dried mushrooms, natto, shiritaki noodles, pot stickers, kimchi/chee, hon dashi and some snacks like daifuku, pastries and candy. It's a small store with about 5 aisles, including one full of VHS videos, one of kitchen supplies, then two aisles of back to back dried/packaged goods. The staff are nice and it's definitely mom and pop, so I like supporting their business. For the Lunar new year, they gave me a free can of orange drink, which was sweet. A good place to get some essential asian ingredients!
