5	Very nice pedicure, Nina was professional and did a very good job.  Shop was clean and tools were sanitized properly.  Will be going back for my regular pedicures.
5	Best place! super clean and everyone is really nice! Mimi is the best! :)
5	Love this place. I always get a pedi, mani, & wax here. For eyebrows, I usually ask for Katie & if you really want good cleaning in a pedi, ask for Anna. Someone I know usually prefers good cut and cleaning because she has pain with her nails and is close to getting ingrown on the big toe. She always requests for Anna. They're great here. For my eye brows I like them clean, not too thin, and more of a natural shape. Katie makes it super clean. Usually by eyebrows are sometimes hard to work with since the direction in which they go naturally is downwards.. Good quality in painting and worth the price. This is my favorite go to for especially for a pedicure. Not only, there's a starbucks right next to the salon! Gotta love this place. Check it out.
