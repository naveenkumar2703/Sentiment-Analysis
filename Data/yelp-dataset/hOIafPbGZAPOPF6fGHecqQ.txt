4	Easy to get in and out of on the NE corner of Durango and Peace Way.Friendly staff will learn your name if you go there often enough. This place has Perrier in 1-liter bottles which is why I often go there. Great if you need a 1/2 case of beer or bag of Fritos. They also have a nice selection of Ben & Jerry's ice-cream.For a convenience store the prices are not too bad.
1	Live right across the st and I've been in a few times.  Two of the guys that work there are a zero on the friendly scale.  Prices seem a little higher also.  Not a fan of this particular store, but on the plus side, easy in easy out.
3	Convenient location and good Shell gas, but somewhat dirty and more often than they should be they are out of something.  GVG's in general seem to be run rather loosely.  Considering the neighborhoods they are in, they should be better cared for.  The kind of bring the area down a bit...
3	great selection, great customer service......creepy creepers loitering !!! ekkkkkk
2	A strange name for a gas station convenience store, I've spotted these all over town. What do I look for in a gas station? Coffee! All of the gas stations obviously have gasoline, the same sodas, energy drinks, chips, gum, gambling machines, etc. But I ask myself, what sets them apart from each other? The different coffee served! I've frequented this location many times and the customer service is great, but on several occasions some of the coffee dispensers were cold as ice. I understand that you can ask them to brew up some fresh, but this was typically at 7 or 8 in the AM. Prime coffee drinking hours! All I'm trying to do is grab a quick cup on my way to work. Make it easy for me.
4	It's a semi clean, decently ran corner store...It's right by my house, so I typically run in to grab small items. The ATM FEE is $3...so that sucks, but it's available if you're in a pinch!  Nothing special...they do have decent service.
