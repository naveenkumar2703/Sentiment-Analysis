4	This is another wee gem for lunch. My vegetarian pals particularly like this place because the menu usually offers them a good choice. You can get a really health lunch or snack here but its not as cheap as some places in the vacinity. We can usualy get a table here which makes me wonder if some people presume you need to be attending something in the Storytelling Centre to use the cafe. Its ideal for just a coffee as the coffee is really nice here.
