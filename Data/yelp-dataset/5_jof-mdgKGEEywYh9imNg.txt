5	Amazing food at great prices. I love the biscuits and gravy and the kielbasa and sauerkraut. The cakes are amazing!!!! And I love that you can special order cakes and pies for whatever occasion. I also enjoy the "We Support Our Troops" wall.
4	I took my mother in law for lunch she had the meatloaf sandwich and I had a bacon cheese burger food was great and prices were reasonable we could not leave until we bought cookies and Bavarian brownies you must try them.  We will go back.
5	Yum we stopped in here on our way out to boulder city. It was a nice family owned and operated place with a "support our troops" theme. They had fresh baked goods.I ordered a ham sandwich and my honey had a Ruben and we ordered some fried zucchini . it was delish. My ham sandwich was simple and fresh, the Ruben was greasy and cheesy. The zucchini was perfect. They brew there own tea and it was all 16$. will defiantly be back soon when were over in old Henderson.
4	Cute and on the way to/from Hoover Dam. Reasonable prices and variety for lunch and sweets.
