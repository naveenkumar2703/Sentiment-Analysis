4	I can't help but but wonder how many times I would have visited this place when I was like 10, when I was still kicking about in tracksuits.They sell a huge selection of all types of sport clothes, I was very impressed by the massive selection of multi colored converse. You could have one pair for every day on the calendar.This place sells alot of stuff that will no doubt please your little cousins and it's not really that much more expensive than JJB.
4	It's perhaps slightly worrying that as I get older, in a sort of inverse ageing effect I find myself wearing tracky bottoms more and more. I very rarely leave the house with them on, but as soon as I get in from work, more often than not, I fire on a nice pair of Umbros, and doss down on my bed.Being set in EH12, Brandshop isn't half as neddy as most sports store, and stocks trainers, t-shirts and all the type of sporting goods that don't really require being into sport to wear. I might actually snap up a pair of Nike trackies one day, as they'll be (very) marginally more socially acceptable to be seen with in public.
4	They sell sporty stuff, so from the outset I knew this place wasn't for me.Saying that, the staff were totally lovely. I fell in love with the girl behind the counter, she was so lovely and totally professional. I wanted to buy something, just because she was so nice, so I did! I bought myself a few socks. Yeah, ok, but everyone needs socks. They've served me well!It's quite a neddy place , as previous yelpers have said, but it's one of the nicer ones.
