3	I have minimal expectations for this chain and they have been met. I have had to return to the restaurant many times after leaving the drive through to get my order fixed.  That would have to be my biggest complaint. On a positive note, the inside and outside of the building  is normally clean and tidy. They have always gotten my food out fast, which normally would be a plus if I didn't have to go back to get the order fixed. This location has a prime location due to the fact they have no competing venues with in miles of them.
4	Only been here once. Had a small order so there should have not been any problems. Place is very clean, and kept up. Crew was very nice.
3	Eating in is ok!going through the drive through....WRONG EVERY TIME!!  Clean place nice folks....just don't drive through. LOL
4	I like this location. Never had an issue. The staff are young but have always been pleasant. The food has always been good and the place is clean as a taco bell can be. :)
4	Not bad for Taco Bell pretty fast.  Its probably the fastest drive thru in town when you in a rush. They even ran me down when they forgot to put my Empanada in the bag. The prices just need to go down on some items.
5	I love coming here. The staff is always friendly, I usually go thru drive thru. Sometimes the monitor works and sometimes it doesnt. The staff typically has the order right and depending what day of the week it is your food is yummie. Sometimes it is burnt if its the younger crowd in the kitchen. But its quick service and if they get something in your order wrong they fix it quick. Kudos
