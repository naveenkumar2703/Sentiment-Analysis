5	The office staff and the Dr are very nice, caring, and went out of their way to make me feel welcome. I loved the office, and John in particualr.
2	Wow. The receptionist here is RUDE. I am not even visiting the doctor. I'm here with my grandma who is seeing the doctor. They were rude to her on the phone when she called, telling her that she would probably have to wait a very long time because Mondays are horribly busy in a way to make her feel bad. That rubbed me the wrong way. Why not inform her that there might be a wait rather than make her feel bad about it? Once we got here, she didn't even have to wait. The only people in the waiting room were waiting for their wives who were seeing the doctor, not actually waiting to SEE the doctor. As I'm sitting here, I heard the receptionist make an outbound call to someone then complain to someone else in the office, threatening about how "it's okay, they will just be sent to collections" as that will be his revenge on the client for whatever reason- all within earshot of other patients. I hope this doctor is worth the piss poor receptionist sitting behind the desk. I'm giving 2 stars since I've never seen this Doctor. I'd like to give one just for the guy behind the desk.
1	Need to clarify, my review is on the male receptionist. I agree with one of the previous reviews. He needs to check his attitude. I was in the waiting room for almost 30 mins. He had a few phone calls during that time, and he's rude to everyone. I mentioned to him that a truck parked between two spots right in front of the clinic. That made it very inconvenient for other patients. (FYI, there're only 4 parking spots in front of the clinic.) he said "yeah, I know. That's my truck." HELLO?! Don't you have employee parking? Isn't it expected to let your customers to have the easier parkings spots to your business?
