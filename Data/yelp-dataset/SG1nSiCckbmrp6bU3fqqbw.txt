5	The space is beautiful and always has great tunes playing. As far as service goes, Scotty gives great hair to even those of us who were not genetically gifted with great locks. I have tough hair to work with- fine and curly. I leave with perfect color and cut every time. Blonde can be difficult to get right and before I found Scotty I never loved my color. Rarely got compliments on my hair. I have now been coming to scotty for over 2 years and I love the shade - just the right blend of high and low lights. Get MANY compliments on my color. Got my FIX and would highly recommend you get yours:)!
4	Great location, friendly, reasonable. Thanks Scotty!
5	Unbelievable salon, highly recommended! ! Scotty is the only stylist I've ever been able to completely trust with my hair.  He does an amazing job with both cut and color.
