5	So I'm sitting here...in the chair...drafting this review. And all I can say is wow. Just, wow. Great staff. Super polished facilities. I bought a groupon for this place and so far so good. This is an amazing concept for a locale like Scottsdale.  Polished is a cosmetic dentistry practice that only cleans($95), polishes($35), and whitens your teeth($95).The whitening worked like a charm.Side Note: I was super hung-over when I walked in the door, and they were quite understanding. Amazingly friendly staff. A+
5	I've been wanting to try Polished forever and finally got around to it. I'm really glad I went, and kind of bummed I waited so long to try it! I'm very self-conscious of my teeth but I had a really great experience. The staff is super friendly and they made me feel completely comfortable. It took a few hours to notice how white my teeth actually were after, but there is definitely a difference. My teeth were a little sensitive after, but my teeth are normally sensitive anyway and the staff explained all that beforehand too. Overall I am very satisfied and would recommend this to anyone.
5	What a great concept!  A spa like dents that specialized in the ascetic aspect of dentistry.  The spa like decor makes me feel welcome and comfortable.  The first time I went in here, it was just by chance.  I needed a cleaning (well over due---not dental insurance).  Their prices were very reasonable and the staff was very friendly.  Eric did my cleaning---now I see him monthly.  I joined their monthly membership program.  I now get my teeth whited and cleaned periodically (each seririve is reasonably priced at $75 for members) and i get my teeth polished for free once per month (included in membership)!  I love the concepts of a "dental spa"!
