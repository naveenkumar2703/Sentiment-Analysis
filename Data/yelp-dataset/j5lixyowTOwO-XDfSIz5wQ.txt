3	This CVS is right by my house so it's pretty much my go-to for anything I can get w/o going all the way down to Albertson's/F&E or Wal-Mart.  The staff here is always nice and always helpful but they can sometimes get swamped and aren't able to help you when it gets busy.  I'm not a fan of the beer coolers, though, because they tend to lock them after a certain time to keep the kids from stealing beer.  This usually would work very well with deterring the kids from taking beer, but if it is busy, I have to wait to get beer and it sometimes turns into a 5-10 minute wait. So then, in turn, I feel deterred haha.  In the back, the pharmacy people are very helpful and the Lead Tech is very nice and accommodating.
4	Typical CVS layout, with all the things that you would usually find. There is a pharmacy. There's a redbox outside if you feel the need for some DVDs.
1	Watch the temp on the cooler.  They were selling milk at 64 degrees and they said it was ok!
5	JJ is a very nice guy and a pleasant cashier.   The change lady is also crazy.  Always a fun time at my neighborhood CVS
