3	This is the only 24-hour Starbucks in the immediate area.  Considering the coffee chain's ubiquitous nature, I'm talking a radius of just a couple of miles.  That said, this place is a bit larger than most strip-mall variety Starbucks you'll find in Vegas and is part of a commercial center that features Las Vegas Athletic Club, some office buildings and a recently added Yogurtland.  Come here any night and you'll find it packed with students with laptops up, books open and headphones on.  There's plenty of tables outside too if you want to feel the warm air in the summertime.  Drink quality is as uniform as you'll get at a Starbucks, which is nothing to write home about.  I usually get a Chai Latte.
1	First off, I would like to say that I will NEVER return to this Starbucks location... I don't care if it's the last cup of coffee on this green earth. There was no line so I walked past (while smiling, of course) a girl just leaning on a portion of the counter chatting with the girl running the register. There was a guy behind the counter being fidgety and seemed upset. He was doing what I remember doing when I was 5... slamming things down in an uproar, gritting his teeth and just BRINGING DOWN the entire mood. Naturally, I was instantly put off. The girl running the register greeted me with an annoyed, fake smile... but a smile none the less. I smiled back and asked her how her day was. She looks at me and stops everything she was doing to stare at me in horror and proceeds to make a disgusted face. Now, allow me to explain what she was looking at... I have an oral piercing called a smiley. I know this is considered odd and not a lot of people know how to 'handle' it but I am a person none the less and when I am a patron, I expect to be treated as such. This girl was an adult and there was no reason for her to make such ridiculous faces at me no matter what she thinks... to me, it's the same as being visibly racist while at work... how many people do you know that would let THAT fly? Anyway, she turns to a girl on the same side of the counter as me (what I can only assume was an off duty employee that I'd walked by on my way in) and just blinks twice before sticking her tongue out in a gaging motion. The girl behind me replies with "Yeah, that's what I'm saying". Let me add that I was still standing between them while this conversation was taking place. When I find myself in places like these... I feel like a grumpy old man thinking to myself "What is WRONG with people these days"? If I had a cup of coffee in my hand when I walked in, I probably would have turned it upside-down over her head. ...and I'm normally a happy person. =)
1	I've found that lots of the starbucks in Vegas are like that, the staff feels that the customer should be serving them and staff is in a very grumpy mood. Don't get me wrong, starbucks has the best coffee but I go to Smith's, buy the beans and brew my own before I'll go into another starbucks coffee shop.
2	24 hours. YES. That is my only favorite thing about this place. Oh, and drive-thru of course...But, for a chain.... for an INTERNATIONAL chain, I expect consistency on my $4 drinks, which I do not get here. Bookies and students take up this place, and it is hard to find a seat whether you are meeting up with a friend or coming here to study. It is just too crowded. Another thing, the smell of old espresso lingers in this store and sticks to my hair and clothes.. ick. The only thing that keeps me coming back is its convenient hours for my night owl ways.
3	Ok it's a Starbucks. I happen to actually like Starbucks. I love how its unpopular to say you like bux but they somehow sell more coffee than anybody else. Either more people like bux than will admit it, or people love drinking coffee they hate :-)This particular location has lots of pros and a couple cons.Pros: 24hrs, drive thru, located right off the freeway and next to lvac.Cons: either understaffed or undertrained but place is not always clean. Place is also often crowded. On a final personal note. I am a Starbucks Gold customer. I come here 5 days a week minimum and usually at the same time and order the same thing at the counter. Been doing this for a couple years. You would think with my name printed on the card that one time in two years, somebody would greet me by name when I come up to the register. Not the end of the world but certainly indicative of a stores training and management. Come on guys I'm a big fan, step it up!
2	Two stars for being open 24 hours and conveniently located.  Besides that, I have never been to another starbucks that consistently screws up my drink. How can you screw up an iced coffee with toffee nut syrup? I keep giving them chances and they keep screwing it up every time, I don't get it.  These people need some training in not only making drinks but also listening to what is being ordered!
4	I love how this place has a 24 hr drive through window. I haven't had a problem with the service, in fact the people were so nice that when I brought my dog with me...they offered him a doggie treat!  They're not that fast, but they get the job done.  The only bad thing I really dislike is the location.  It's a little far from home, and right off a busy freeway.  The traffic getting into here and out is a hassle.  In fact getting through the drive through is a hassle.  I wish they'd move down near Silverado and Eastern.  Possibly in the Silverado Plaza?Just a suggestion.
4	My car thermometer said it was 38 degrees this morning when I was headed to work, and I was in the mood for a quick caffeine pick-me-up. Thank you coffee gods for giving this Starbucks a drive thru! There is usually a line of 2-5 cars when I stop here before work but the people working always seem to get people on their way quickly. I have never gotten the wrong drink and most of the time they don't even charge me for the extra drizzle of caramel I request! I have never stepped foot inside, so no comments on the cleanliness, or lack thereof. All I know is on cold mornings, that drive-thru is a lifesaver!
2	The Mocha Fraps I get at this location are usually great, but the last Mocha Frap I got tasted like a bitter, slushy, plant soil flavored drink topped with whip cream. Ive Never tasted something so yucky that's suppose to be so sweet and creamy. One good note, on the exchange not only did they make it right they bumped my drink to a larger size. =)
4	I know others have been a little harsh on this location.  I have to say I like it though.  I have to confess that I do not drink coffee but I get hot chocolate and tea here.  The biggest cons of this place is the cleanliness.  It is sometimes a little dirty but normally there are not a lot of people on staff and with the shop being open 24 hours a day it is hard to get the place super clean. Also being in the same shopping center with a bunch of other restaurants and Las Vegas Fitness Club it can be a real pain to turn left into the shopping center.The upside to this place if the atmosphere.  I like the general chatter and coziness of the place.  I like to come here and work on school work or write reviews for Yelp.  :D  It is pretty easy to get to a plug to keep my computer running and I can get a drink and/or a snack when I am starting to digress  from homework.
2	I am not a fan of masking the taste of coffees or teas with cream and sugar. Give me my caffeine straight up, hot or cold. The convenience of having a Starbucks on every corner allows for easy accessibility, but I want taste. I like teas that take more effort than to remove from a pre-packed bag and steep. No Japanese tea ceremony needed, but something more than what I can do at home is appreciated.The employees are nice and it breaks my heart to bash on businesses with good customer service, but I just don't see anything beyond convenience with Starbucks. The small Pike's Place coffee is a good deal, at two dollars, for someone who just wants something basic and quick.
2	Possibly the slowest drive-thru I have been to, even when there is no wait. I wish they would work on this since it is the closest one to my house.
4	Starbucks....What can I say about starbucks....For the taste...I guess its alright.  I happen to like quite a few other places over it for taste but by the same token, I gave this place four stars for the following reasons...      **********************  Pro's *******************1) Open 24 hours2) Always makes my drink right even though I have pretty complicated taste buds (2-3 shots of expresso over ice, 3 pumps of toffee nut and 1 pump of sugar free hazelnut all over ice) The good thing is if you have a registered card, they don't charge you for the flavor.  Since I ask for two different flavors, they could very well charge me for one but they never do. You also get one free refill if you order Ice coffee, regular coffee or their passion ice tea. Can't beat that now can you?3) Close to my saigon 8 which has awesome vietnamese food for vegas, yogurtland to quench my frozen yogurt urges and right off the freeway.  **********  Now for the con's :(  *********1) Way too cold all the time, I leave a blanket, and a sweater in the car just in case i head here to study. 2) The music is way loud.  Even with awesome earplugs, I can hear the music clearly....no bueno.3) The seats are super uncomfy.  I have a seat cushion in the car if i come here. ( Hardcore studier here! )  Hence, I sometimes opt for the Trop and Decatur location even though I live on the outskirts of henderson, takes me 40 mins to get there...They have booth seating and its not going to cause me frostbite toes. :)   All in all though...great place for students to study late night, just make sure to bring earplugs and a sweater.
5	Always quick, accurate, and flavorful! Great job!
4	I needed a caffeine fix and this was right off the freeway.  I had noticed this location once when I was a passenger in a car and could look around and enjoy.  I filed away in my brain the location so I could stop here when I needed to.The need arose yesterday.  I had hiked a little under four miles and this was a good place to stop for my daily Starbucks.I did not use the drive through.  The line was long.  Instead I parked in front and went inside.  The workers were very friendly and competent. I was in and out in no time at all and right back on the freeway heading to Summerlin.
5	Provided the Yelp gods don't strike me down for reviewing a Starbucks I will always view this Starbucks as the model for what they all should be. Friendly, fast, accurate and masters of the bean-inspired beverage. Trust me when I say I go to Starbucks a lot. Every day. My day is screwy if I don't visit one of these glorious kingdoms of coffee. This location is just great at what they do. A high traffic area they probably see hundreds of customers every morning and still remember my drink, even when I'm just talking to a speaker at the drive thru! Go inside and it's like watching a well oiled machine. Don't let the lines scare you because these people know you have somewhere to be, even if it is their couches a few feet away. I'm not going to bore you with the choices cause everyone has been to a Starbucks (venti iced coffee with 4 pumps toffee nut and whipped cream for me, a-thank you) but I think the fact they're so busy keeps their coffee fresh and great tasting. As a self proclaimed Starbucks addict, this is the absolute best one to feed my beast.
5	Great Service and they are always busy - everyone is super nice and orders have always been outstanding.  They know my name and order every time I go!
5	There's nothing better than a staff that remembers a regular's name and drink....this staff has it down...Not that that's critical but it is one of those extra touches that customers appreciate.  It makes it painful to go to other locations with lesser quality employees.  I've found that some Starbucks have either the smiling faced, happy to give you your fix staff, or the ultra granola that smirks at your because you aren't driving a Prius and destroying the earth.This one is full of the smiling staff and extremely friendly and helpful.  They get SLAMMED at the drive-thru more than any other Starbucks or business I've ever seen.  Sometimes when it gets so bad they surprise you after a looong wait with an apology and FREE DRINK.  Without prompting they say, "sorry for the wait, it's on us today!"...No complaining needed they just get that you were waiting too long and make sure you leave with a smile.See ya guys 5 times a day!!!!
4	I love starbucks.  I  know it is so corporate and blah blah but the drinks really are great.  I can always count on my drink tasting the same (unless I maybe go to a grocery store one).  Other cofffee shops just don't typically taste as good.
4	THE BEST PART OF WAKING UP..... IS HAVING STARBUCKS IN YOUR CUP....This place never fails me. This particular location is located off of eastern and 215 near the LVAC gym. Its 24 hours that's what I love about this Starbucks and it also has free wifi.. I love to go here to chat with freinds and use as a meeting point.. I also love studying here since it's just down the road from my house.. Also I love people watching here when im tryinging to kill time i see some interesting stuff.. for example I witness a internet meet up.. too bad the girl was not interested in the guy... also witnessed a guy trying to pick up a girl at the Starbucks. Haha can you tell I get so bored easily.. Go to this Starbucks you'll see some intersting crap... LOL!
4	Some mornings, this place is absolutely amazing.  Other mornings, it's really off.  When I go in the afternoons, I receive good, solid service.  So most of the time, it's the bee's knees.Protip: If you're going for your morning coffee before work, the earlier the better (as if I really had to tell you that).  I actually work fairly early (7am start) so even when I stop by here around 6:30-6:40, it's pretty unpredictable.  One morning I was in and out very quickly, another it took them almost 15 minutes to get through, oh, 3-4 cars.Drink orders are always spot on, so nothing to complain about here.  Drive-Thru PLUS 24 hours PLUS down the street?  Yeah, I'm kind of a sucker for it.Just beware the mass of students and hipsters with their laptops!  I usually order to-go so I'm not a stickler on seating.
4	You know a place is a great place when you go and there is hardly any place to sit other than the floor. You may have to wait a minute or two (don't count and or quote me) to get a table, but it is well worth it. The staff has been exceptionally kind and friendly, always willing to please. That alone should gain your business. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and FAST. I usually go around the afternoon to the early evening and there is a bit of people, but I never have to wait long to get a table. I love that it's 24 hours, and the later I've stayed the friendlier the staff seemed to get. A+ in my books!
4	This is a Starbuck's that never sleeps. It is the 24 Hour Starbuck's serving the Southeast Valley.    This is my go-to Starbuck's very late at night or very early in the morning. When I suffer from insomnia or I work very early shifts, I come here for my caffeine fix. This Starbuck's is testimony that there is nightlife at Starbuck's. For crying out loud, at three in the morning it is happening.    When I come here in the very early morning I feel safe. There is plenty of protection. Ordinarily, I will be sharing the place with Metro, the Henderson Police, or the Nevada Highway Patrol.  In the peak hours, Starbuck's mania lives at this location. When I visit this location in the late afternoon, it is ordinarily full to capacity to the degree that there will be a wait for a table. It is common to see Starbuck's customers waiting with a cup of coffee to get a table. I am one of them. This Starbuck's fills up with an eclectic group of people that include people leaving the Las Vegas Athletic Club, friends meeting up, business people, and people working on their lap tops.   As far as customer service, it has usually been good. At three in the morning I do not expect four star customer service. I am glad that there is a Starbuck's open. Because this location is hyper busy there is less interaction between barista and customer than a slower Starbuck's at Valle Verde at Paseo Verde would have. As long as this is the 24 hour Starbuck's serving the southeast Valley I will return. Especially when I cannot sleep.
5	Miss this place! I have lived in many different cities over the years and this is the only city that never sleeps and of course has a 24 hour Starbucks! I enjoy the customer service and the team that works here and no matter when I come I get a great cup of Coffee!
5	Out of all the starbucks they made the best caffe mocha!
1	Ordered a grande white chocolate mocha in the drive through, come home and come to notice that they only filled my cup half way with coffee. Very upset I paid 5$ for a grande but received the amount of a tall.
4	I know I am addicted.. I love the Starbucks.. They are pretty much everywhere now, and it is hard to write a review for just one store. But 24 hours! Heck yes batman, I am a fan! This town is 24 hours, so it is great, good place to people watch as well!
4	Best location! The baristas are great and they really go out of their way to remember my name and my order. They are super fast and for the most part you can be in and out in 5 minutes. They are expanding the store which will be great when it is done but for the next 3 weeks they have a standing room only temporary store.
3	It's a 'bucks. We're talking about coffee here, and with S'Bucks for me, it's always over priced for what you get, however once in awhile, you get really good service. That's what I'm commenting on today. The service was impeccable.
5	My new local coffee spot to do the following:-Read-write-grade papers-blog-and just handle stuffDid I mention it is 24 hours?!Also, ample seating and tables!
4	Ordered the coffee which is really good and also ordered the oatmeal with blueberries they ran out of blueberries but they're very busy they're very quick and I would recommend coming here I'm a very good environment nice atmosphere!
5	They recently renovated and the place is brighter, warmer, and more spacious. The only place in town (that I kind of) that is open late enough for me to get work done. It's the perfect study spot!
1	During graveyard shift I stopped in for a cup of Joe and a bite to eat. The cashier was absolutely the worst person I've ever encountered at a Starbucks. She just looked at me with death in her eyes until I asked her if I could order something.  She was not delighted that she had to get out of her chair to heat up my sandwich.  She limps over to the toaster puts my food in then proceeds to throw away trash using her bare hands to push it down. Gets better...after handling the trash she doesn't wash her hands and uses them to take my food out of the oven!! Wtf! Then she tosses my food on the counter and says "there ya go". ..um hello did I break your ankle? How about taking the night off so you don't ruin other people's!
4	No doubt one of the better Starbucks in town for a couple reasons.1. its super convenient - located right off the 215.2. drive thru!3. open 24/7 one of the few in Vegas and the only one on the south side.4. newly expanded -  double the size! more space for studying and hanging outKeep in mind that this location does get packed. Even with the new expanded area it can still be tough to find a spot camp in during peak hours. The coffee is like any other Starbucks location and the drive-thru is pretty quick. Perfect spot for late night study sessions or just hanging out.
4	This Starbucks is just really useful for the tired, overworked, and wired. People like us NEED this place! We need a place to sit down, relax, and continue to work. This Starbucks is like my home. I use it to study for exams because it has a big seating area and it's open 24/7. However, even though I need coffee to get through life, I wouldn't say Sbux serves the absolute best coffee. They also have the worst coffee shop food in general! Everything I eat is always stale or odd tasting. But, man, is getting frappes and sweet drinks here addictive!! I just can't get enough of it!!! Some of my favorite drinks include: Java Chip (my everyday drink), Shaken Iced Passion Tea Sweetened (my diet drink haha), and Caramel Apple Spice (my feel good drink on a cold night). Oh, make no mistake, you'll definitely catch me here at finals week!
1	Boo!!! I LOVE Starbucks! But they were not nice here! I may be spoiled by my awesome Starbucks employees! But still, come on, you work for Starbucks! Smile be nice!
3	I avoid this Starbucks as often as I can. The only reason for the visits to this locations is because they are open 24/7.No matter what time of day it is, the place is always packed with people on their computers "working." Some of them may be legitimately working, but a lot of them are just hanging out. It's hard to find a spot to just sit for a minute and enjoy a drink. Only tables that are open would be the ones outside, and that's because it's either freezing or a million degrees. I didn't know this was your own personal office to sit for hours and stare at your computer screen. What happened to studying at home or at the library? Maybe I'm just old school. Anyway, the drinks are always good and the employees are nice and efficient. The drive through does take a while so I suggest just going inside.
3	I've been to this one Starbucks before (drive-thru) and it was good but I am so annoyed with my service today. I went there around 11:30pm because I was craving an iced caramel macchiato after work and because I wanted to see the activity so I could maybe make it my new "local" Starbucks as it's open 24/7, even though it's a bit farther than 2 other ones. It was packed and with good energy. The one guy at the register looked like he definitely didn't want to be there though. I know you've probably had a rough day but as a customer we don't know, so give everyone your best service and always flash a smile. It's simple, be nice. As I told him my first drink order he started to walk away. As I started saying the rest of my order he looked upset and kept on walking while taking my order. As he was always looking down I decided to keep my order simple. He took forever to type my order and I had to slide my card 4 times like wtf. He then proceeded to make the drinks of the other people that ordered AFTER me! I had just ordered a simple tall hot caramel macchiato and a venti iced caramel macchiato! After I got my drinks I asked for a cup holder because I don't have one in my car. He sighed and basically tossed me the cup holder tray, he wasn't even a foot away! All this time I was nice and calm trying not to say anything so I just rushed out of there to try and control myself as I didn't want to start complaining about service. As I get in my car and taste my iced macchiato, it's very milky. I could not taste any coffee at all. My moms drink was warm, not hot. I like to taste my coffee! If I had wanted a glass of milk, I could have just gone home. I didn't go back to complain because I knew if I did I would just get angry and start a scene which I didn't want to do as I might want to go back, but if that guy is there again, I'm asking someone else to take/make my order.
4	They have a drive-thru thus...automatic 4 stars. I am not hard to please when it comes to Starbucks, as I only ever order one thing: a treinta black iced coffee. I know that doesn't make me a connoisseur of S'bucks so take my review for what it's worth. Now where's my coffee?
1	Deserves no stars today! I went through the drive-thru as usual and ordered a grande hot mocha extra hot and a piece of lemon pound cake. Traffic is really bad due to the time if day, so I was setting in traffic when I tasted the Mocha and literally tried it a couple times hoping I was wrong the first time. The mocha tasted like hot water with milk! No flavor what so ever! I fought traffic to return and went inside. Stood in line for about 10 minutes and told the guy at the register what had happened and he looks at me and said okaaay....like what do you want? I told him I had to fight traffic to return and he just looked at me. He told the barista I said it tasted like water and they made me a new one. I took one taste and the same exact thing! WATER! Are you kidding me! They offered no other alternative, like maybe a drink he actually knew how to make?!?! Now I'm fighting traffic to go to another Starbucks and pay a second time just to get a descent drink! This is totally unacceptable!
1	Rant Alert!!Ok I am a huge Starbucks fan and a loyal customer. I love my home store and this is not about them. I am not usually one to complain, however, now I have to. So listen up because today was just ridiculous...... again. Every Saturday is the same nightmare at this Starbucks store. Not just once in a while, but every time I have been in there. My gym, LVAC, is located there and I go on Saturday mornings for Zumba and afterwards I get a Greek yogurt with honey and granola. This store just finished construction making it 2 or 3 times as big as it was. But I ask you WHY? Management is inept and unable to lead or schedule shifts and has never been able to staff this store correctly. There is always a long, looooooong wait. Not necessarily because of a long line either. There are never enough people working EVER at any time that I have been in there over the past 3 or more years. It pisses me off when I see one person behind the counter taking orders and then fulfilling the orders. That means, if the customer at the register orders five sandwiches, heated, with five drinks and a pound of coffee ground finely please, you're screwed for a good 10 minutes. That's absurd! That's money lost! Bar-backs people! There should be two people behind the counter at all times that do nothing but fulfill orders. PERIOD. This location needs to send in secret shoppers to see just how much money this store is losing because of poor staffing and management. Hand over fist I tell you! There is no sense of urgency to sell and this team does not work together. People going on breaks when there are 10 people in line is bad management, bad scheduling and bad for business. Someone needs to get upper management involved toute suite. Or ask me, a dedicated customer, how to streamline your operation to work for ME. You heard me.........
4	Fast drive through. Drink order was right and the associate was friendly and on point.
2	Yeah their drinks are good but the long line I ALWAYS have to wait in makes me not want ever get Starbucks or give them my money. I understand they're busy and often receive large orders but they need more staff to be working because I'm over waiting 15 minutes to get a frappucino.
3	I hate that it is located on Eastern. It's such a busy street and always have traffic. I just want to get a frappe without getting frustrated bad drivers.. on top of that, their parking lot is always full. If you happen to go to this and want to get your Starbucks fast, do not go through the drive through. I repeat do not go through the drive through! The line may seem short and more convenient, but honestly it takes twice as long than the line inside (from my experience). I really enjoy that this Starbucks is 24 hours  and that they expanded the building. They have comfortable seating and a very clean environment(probably the cleanest). One thing for sure is no matter the time, this place is busy
5	This is my favorite Starbucks, when the drive thru line is too backed up they will normally give me a free coffee to say sorry. If you are in a hurry and the drive thru is long I would recommend going inside. You will get your drink faster that way.
1	The management at this store must REALLY be struggling!  It's all about training, recipe's, and cleanliness folks!  This is a very busy location, and in the heart of the morning they only have one cashier...and that individual does not understand how to work with the POS system.  Then the drink was done to taste weak and gross...how difficult is it to make a chai tea latte...its a mix!?  On top of that...they were out of napkins and other essentials, and all the areas to prep coffee or sit down were filthy dirty. I need a new coffee option by my work! Any suggestions?
5	Ally took our order and I have to type she knows her stuff!!!  I had several questions and WOW she gave me an education on coffee!  Who knew?  I strongly recommend your next trip here ask for her and ask her about the way coffee is made...The new remodel here is exceptional.  They have literately doubled the space.  Great out door seating as well!
4	This Starbucks is pretty awesome! It's located right near my gym and is my go to place whenever I need a quick pick me up.The biggest benefit that this Starbucks has compared to most others is that it is almost open 24/7. I can't remember correctly if it's either Sunday and Monday, or Monday and Tuesday, but during one of those couple of days every week, during 1am-4am, they are closed to do a deep cleaning of the store. I appreciate that so that it doesn't turn into a complete sh*tshow!Another great benefit is that this Starbucks is HUGE! It's not your typical small intimate coffee shop. This place is large... and in charge!! (like Charles - Scott Baio) ((not the Fonz, but still pretty good))Great location, great hours, convenient, clean, the employees seem well trained. Can't really find any faults with this one. Way to go! (But I save the 5-stars for the local spots ;p)
4	Great! Late night Starbucks with plenty room inside and outside too sit down.The crew is friendly here... wifi works strong and fast! Open 24/7 for the most part... was here on a Monday they did close down at 1am-4am for cleaning.
5	I'm here almost everyday. Love the staff and love hanging out with my girlfriend's! Use the app on your phone to collect stars and get free stuff!
3	A normal starbucks place. I had a pleasant experience (although they manage to spell my name wrong every single time lol) Nothing too exciting, just another starbucks down the street.
4	I love this place. The staff s  nice, it's open 24 hours and they don't mess up my drinks and are usually very accommodating. Although it gets pretty cold in there occasionally.
2	As a former barista and supervisor, people make beverages with lack of regard to standard when to manager is not present. I watch shift supervisors airate drinks mid steam (as opposed to at the beginning to make the best environment for the milk). Sometimes teas are not shaken, and coffee and creme base is not added to the blended beverages at the right time. It's sad that I have to be very conscious of who makes my drink if I want it to be good. Making beverages right would make people happier.I've committed myself to getting iced beverages knowing that I probably won't get a decent hot beverage, albeit I often get too much ice unless I don't ask for light ice. Thankfully the store is spacious and the staff is nice... But again... Coffee is not a factory farm product. The baristas at green valley and warm springs are much better trained and consistent
1	Service was horrible, waited ten minutes at the drive up window for a person to acknowledge we were waiting for our drinks. There were no cars in the drive thru when we arrived, and no reason for it to take so long. Drinks were wrong when we finally got them. Will not be returning to this location.
1	Absolutely the WORST Starbucks in town. Don't attempt the drive through unless you have AT LEAST 20 minutes to kills then be prepared to rind the person they forgot items in your order. Today I ordered 3 cake pops and it was given to me in the plastic packaging that they get from their supplier! They didn't even bother to bag it! And don't bother going inside if there's a line as the cashiers have full conversations with everyone at the register, preventing anything from being made in a timely fashion. From now on I'll go across the street to Madhouse, same coffee - slightly cheaper and no line.
2	I used to go 5 to 6 days a week. Since the store has been remolded. Made to be one of the largest stores in town. Please step up the service. Show a sense of urgency, we all have busy lives..we all don't have an extra 20 minutes to get are coffee in the morning.
1	Slowest Starbucks drive thru on the planet! Don't come if you actually have some place to be in the next 30 min. And it's 2pm! I'm hoping the groceries I just bought will still be good. Smh......
1	Very nice store, but I was completely caught off guard and it wasn't even busy. No line, not crowded so I don't understand but your employees Zeke & Hector had the worse attitude. SMH. Never felt so disrespected as a customer in my life. Very disappointed especially I light of the quality service Starbucks is known for. They seemed more concerned about what was happening behind the counter than providing quality service. And I guess it would help if they liked what they were doing. Seemed like Zeke would've preferred to be somewhere else. Ok I'm done. SMH. Maybe I'll give this store another shot in the future but for now I'll drive across town of I have to in order to get quality service from another Starbucks store.
4	I don't know when they renovated this place but it became HUGE! It looks a lot nicer too.I always come here late at night so I can't vouch for the quality during the morning and afternoon.But late night, its quite a joy to chill out with a coffee and get some work done. Highly recommend.The internet is quite fast too but maybe that's because there were only a handful of people here...Just make sure to bring headphones as their music tends to be a bit loud.
2	Music is way too loud. Felt like I was in a concert trying to study. Asked for them to turned it down nicely but all they said was "we'll see what we can do" like wtf?! Are they doctors or something and afraid to tell me straight up yes or no?
2	stopped here cause we had a gift card.  Next time, I'm giving the gift card away.  SLOWEST service ever!  Drive 5 more minutes & go to Grouchy Johns!!
2	This review is for 10.29.2014.Walking this spacious environment, my friend and I were happier and more pleasant after great brunch. I tried to reload my card. The agent, Zik (I am not sure about the spelling of his name), was impatient and didn't know how to reload the card. He had to ask 2 other agents for the processing. We presented the promotion code for 25% off via the email with my cell, and again, he failed to process it. After a while of wait, he told us, he couldn't enter the code. Without asking for supervisor's help, he looked at us and said NO. He was obviously not willing or intended to help even we were the only customers in line. We sensed that waiting any longer wouldn't do any good but ruin our day. There were no smiles or greetings, no asking my name or choice on the milk, and no name on my cup the entire wait or purchase.A beautiful day-off with great hanging out with friends, just ruined by him.
3	Did not appreciate the wait time but love that this starbucks is open late and very early in the morning. Tried my first hazelnut machiatto tonight! Fell in love.
1	Everyone I go here they are rude and they take forever to make my drinks. The only good thing is that it closes late for when u need some caffeine.  Not to mention they are so rushed that they don't keep they're work station clean and santized. I saw a lady a cup into a milky looking puddle on the counter near where the blenders are and used the same cup to pour their drink in from the blender. Disgusting... if you are in a hurry DON'T GO HERE. it's going to take a least 15 minutes to get your drink.
5	I love coming to this location even though it's in a busy location because it's on eastern. The service is great, I had Adam serve me in the drive thru today and he was excellent and recommended the white peppermint mocha to me and it is so goood!! It's also a good place to study for a night owl, college student like me since it's 24 hours :)
4	This Starbucks location opens almost 24 hours, which means for those of you students like myself or regular coffee junkies out there who want to get a late cup of joe but too lazy to brew one yourself then this is the place for you.  Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of Starbucks out there in this valley but according to my knowledge there are only two locations that have almost 24 hour service.  I am not much a coffee drinker but Starbucks Banana walnut bread is one of my favorite to grab when I am at any Starbucks coffee shop ( the other item I usually get is the Rasberry juice in Trenta size).  I only rate this location 4 out of 5 stars because of its location, it is a bit of a drive or walk for me to get to this location.  I was referred by another Starbucks employee from the Arroyo Grande/Paseo Verde location because of its almost 24 hour service.  I say almost 24 hour service because there diner closes 3:15 am and opens again at 4:30 a.m. same day
1	The ultimately slowest sbux EVER!!!!!!!they seem to have plenty of employees but the speed just isn't there! Isn't Starbucks supposed to be convenient ?
3	Obviously the drinks are up to par, that and it's 24 hours are my main reasons for going here. It gets a little crowded some times, but its expected given the location. The staff for the most part is great, a couple times I've had to deal with someone waking up on "the wrong side of the bed". Who hasn't had a bad day though! If the bathrooms were kept a bit  cleaner, it would earn another star, but that has yet to be seen.
3	I go here often to study when I need to stay up late because it's open 24/7 unlike the other locations. However, I am in a love hate relationship because there is never any seating here. I've had to study outside in the cold because of lack of seating. The employees aren't always the friendliest either. They do their job, but don't really go above and beyond. If you can get a seat then enjoy!
3	Why does this location have to be the dirtiest? Even after the renovation people just leave shit everywhere. People are filthy!!!
4	This location is always busy inside and the drive-thru always has a few cars waiting.  The tables are always taken with wi-fi users.  The employees are cheerful and it's conveniently located.
