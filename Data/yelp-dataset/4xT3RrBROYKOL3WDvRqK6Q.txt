4	Express is currently offering 20% off already reduced items offering a 60% sale to clear summer items for fall.
4	Express clothes do it for me. I think the styles are outgoing without being over the top. The fundamental plain t-shirts, v-necks, polo's and button downs are made from comfortable fabrics that fit well. I tend to get compliments whenever I wear one of their items. If you're looking for something dressy, they've got that too. Even the accessories like belts, eyeglass wear and socks look good. Admittedly, the graphic t's are a wee bit douchey, sporting catch phrases like "top shelf only kind of night," or  "epic night in progress." They keep it classy, though! Sign up for the email list for updates nearly every day. Right now they're on a half-off everything sale. Definitely geared for the young professional crowd in both style and price.
4	1MX extra slim fit, the only shirt that allows me to not look like I'm wearing a parachute.  Thank you express for making a shirt that conforms to my body at an affordable price.  I miss Structure because Express for men just seems feminine but whatever you got my business.
