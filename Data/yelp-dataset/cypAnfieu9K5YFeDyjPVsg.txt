3	22 min wait, 2nd week of the month. Lane 1. Says 7min avg wait time.I realize NOW, that an ODB readable vehicle can choose ANY lane, whereas the older non-ODB read must be in Lane 2 or 3.Signage poorly designage.
5	(Wait =7 min) + (Inspection = 3 min) = 10 minutes total! I arrived at 6:45p on a Monday night. There were 2 cars getting worked on.  I've been at this location once before 2 years ago and I didn't have a long wait then either. The manager was super friendly after I'm sure was a long day. I will keep coming to this location.
4	No one likes going to emissions but this place isn't bad.  I've never had to wait long here.  The staff and service is great for an emissions center.  There's a third party DMV right next door so you can get your tags when you're done here!The location is tucked away on the side street so it can be hard to find.
5	The fastest smog check I have ever experienced. I was in and out in less than 10 minutes. DON'T GO ANYWHERE ELSE!!!! This is the best place ever. And it only cost me $28
5	I haven't had to have my vehicle tested in years since Ohio stopped emissions testing and I was very apprehensive because I know how long the waits can be.  Imagine my surprise when I waited less than 15 minutes.  The young man who did my testing had "trainee" on his name tag and I certainly hope he continues with his excellent attitude and customer service abilities.  Very happy with this place!
5	Just used this location for our most recent emissions test, and for our emissions test two years ago.Both times, we've been in and out within 10 minutes. The staff is friendly and efficient :)Thank you for making a mundane task quick and painless!
