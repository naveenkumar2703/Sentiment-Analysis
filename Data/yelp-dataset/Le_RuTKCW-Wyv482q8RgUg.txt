5	Lou is a A+ kinda guy and it shows in his work. Never a doubt when I call him to clean the carpets the dogs and kids abuse.
5	Lou is the meaning of old school customer service. He is on time, calls you back and does a great job with a smile!Darin Marques
5	We were a military family in the middle of pcsing cross country and Lou cleaned our sofa, tried to salvage the chaise lounge on my sectional(don't get me started on the reason!) And our carpets for our final out(and even helped us with a little snafu my 8 year old did!). OUTSTANDING service this guy! On time, in and out, friendly, and he even have us tips on how to clean our sofa for when we moved(if we needed to in the future).  If we weren't in FL, we would definitely be using him again! Help support you small business city folks, go with Lou!!
