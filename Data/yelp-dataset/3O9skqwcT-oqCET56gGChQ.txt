4	Lovely place in the middle of nowhere.  Bottom floor is the bar and the second floor is a game area.  Appetizers were good and cold beer.
3	Been to this bar numerous times over the years. Its in the middle of nowhere but perfect for bikers who are on rides to and from Wickenburg to stop in for a drink and some food. They have a menu with regular bar food. Nothing fancy but good enough to fill your tummy. Drinks are good and service is always good. This place has a real homey feel to it. Lots of TV's and even a punching bag game. Arcade upstairs but Ive never seen anyone up there.
5	Girl at a bar very nice & cannot complain at all! We love to spend time upstairs!!!! Very cool & cozy place to hung out!!!!!
5	We have a great time on Fridays and Saturday night! Fun karaoke with the Karaoke Kings, good drinks! Nice outdoor patio. Excellent for bikers, locals,passers-by, Cowboys and whomever just wants to have fun. Pool tables, video,shuffleboard,etc.
