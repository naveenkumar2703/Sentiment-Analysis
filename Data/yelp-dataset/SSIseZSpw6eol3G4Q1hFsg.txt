3	Very hit or miss, depending on who is doing the cooking. If it is the older guy, he was the actual chef from the old Chicken shack, and he makes bangin' wings. The hispanic guy messed up my order 3 times out of 4 so far, he is the chef "in training" but seriously, its just wings, you make them all day, it cant be that hard? Mostly he makes the wings plain and gives you a tiny side of whatever sauce you asked for to dip in. This is WRONG. When I order "habanero honey" I want the wings smothered in that delicious sauce. That should be the default way, always. This is in Cactus Jack's saloon, and the reason why I believe is because the bar rents out the kitchen to the Chicken Shack guys. From a logical standpoint, it makes sense because its cheaper than leasing one of the empty storefront's next door and installing a new kitchen, but it may be something they want to consider for the long run. I have no problem going in a bar to get the food, but I can see how some would think this to be an annoying and avoidable step.1/5 when the hispanic is the cook (so far, maybe hell step his game up), 4/5 when it is the older man.
5	This is one of the best chicken places in the Southeast area.  Most people go for the wings but they also have a flavorful grilled option; even more delicious when coupled with their signature honey barbecue sauce. Bottom line: great food, drinks, and friendly people. Definitely recommend!
