1	Do not do business with this company! They don't clean up after themselves and do horrible installation of screens and black out curtains! If you need them to fix anything like we have had to have done repeatedly,they will give you the run around. All I can say is they out source everything to other companies! Who will push their business cards on you! Our screens are all fraying and black out curtains were not installed properly! What a headache. Now we need to pay someone else to fix a $20,000 job!
1	do not do business with these people.. out side sun shades pulled out of the columns and scratched up the rock on the columns and they didn't want to fix it. a complaint was filed with the roc, and they finally agreed to fix it. we also had then make and install shutters in our master bedroom, they are about 10 feet long, now they have pulled out of the wall. still waiting for them to fix this problem.
5	I had a very pleasant experience with the staff at Today's Interiors.  My custom ordered motorized shades  compliment  our decor and work better than expected. They're easy to use and the staff  cleaned up 100% after installation.  I will definitely do business with them again.
