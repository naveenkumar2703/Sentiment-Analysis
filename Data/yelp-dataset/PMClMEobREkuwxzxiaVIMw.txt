4	Harmony Lunch is a time machine. Inside the 1930's themed diner, is a sign stating the diner opened in 1930. I am pretty sure that sign was new then, and I am equally sure that is the newest update to the decor.The restaurant apparently hasn't changed since the 1930's, and while 40 years ago, the place must have seemed out of date; it is amazing now to see that it has survived. Another point of interest is the kitchen. It is inside the dining room. You can actually watch your lunch being cooked. Not everything is out of date, the washrooms are modern and very clean. I stopped in for breakfast the other morning with my wife. The food was great, and the service quick and friendly. Harmony Lunch is famous for their hamburgers which have been noted in several other reviews. I look forward to my next visit to Harmony Lunch.
5	I LOVE harmony lunch! They make great shakes. They have fried onions with their burgers, which are also amazing! Such a great place and has been around for so long.
5	Ultimate historic restaurant since the 30's.  The best, most unique hamburger & fried onion place period
4	I overheard some seniors on the bus once, saying that the best burger in town was at The Harmony. I had always dismissed the place based on its outside appearance, but am always up for a good burger, so I gave it a shot. It is a unique flavor - seems to be somewhat like a sausage patty on a fresh bun. I always order it with extra fried onions. I do like the burger a lot, and always come back whenever I'm in town. Must have a chocolate shake to go with it. Yum.
