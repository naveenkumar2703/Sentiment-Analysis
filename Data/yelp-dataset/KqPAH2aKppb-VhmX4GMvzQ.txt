4	Today I stopped into Luna Pizza for takeout. It is a small restaurant. They have reviews that they post on the front counter. The guy that owns it, Steve, is from Albania. I would have given them five stars, but the service isn't great. It is basically what do you want, they take your order, and walk away to make it. There wasn't a thank you through the entire experience. However, the pizza is great. I got a 16 inch with half just cheese, and the other half pepperoni and tomatoes. Wonderful. It is a little on the greasey side, so you are going to need a few napkins. They also had calzone's, salads, and pasta dishes on their menu, but I only ordered pizza. The garlic rolls looked great - I might need to try them next time. They are right next door to Panda Express and Subway. I can never understand why Panda is always so busy, which they were today. They are not that great.
4	Enjoyed this place for many years.  Great place for 2 slices and drink for just $5 at lunchtime.  Nice selection of slices, including a sicilian crust option.  Friendly service and always clean.  I think there was an issue with the landlord and they're no longer here.  Only Luna is over by John C. Lincoln Hospital in the Target parking lot.
5	I've been searching for a "bar pizza" that I grew up on back East and Luna comes the closest.  I've been here 5 years and have tried just about every pizza around and was very disappointed.  Luna helps me make it through to my Boston visits.  The chicken wings are also very good.  It's a 15 min. ride but worth it.
