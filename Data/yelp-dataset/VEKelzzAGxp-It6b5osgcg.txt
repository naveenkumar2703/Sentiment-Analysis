5	I've love Subway and this subway made the biggest super full sandwich i've ever seen. Don't know the girls name who made it but would hire that lady just to personally make me subways (if I was rich).   Super clean and super sandwiches...best subway i've been to in a LONG TIME.  I can't believe i just reviewed subway!!
4	Subway is typically a good respectable place for a quick sandwich.  This location is as well.  Fast, cheap, and tasty.  Good location right off  of Higley and Pecos.
5	this is a great subway!  clean, staff is nice.  great location.
3	A subway is a sub way no matter what but i jut thought that this one had a little better servis and was a little more clean than the rest,
4	Subway is Subway. If nothing else, they are consistent. Consistently good, that is.
4	good location.  MAKE MORE CHOC CHIP COOKIES!  this location never has any, but has lots of the kind nobody seems to buy (cranberry, raspberry).  give the people what they want!!  i swear some a-hole comes in and buys the entire tray of choc chip cookies every day.
