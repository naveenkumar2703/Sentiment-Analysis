2	Price of water went up. Frozen yogurt is either vanilla or chocolate. Some hot food eg: nachos, hot dogsSmells musty. Staff is slow.
4	If you need ice for a party and live in the west valley this is your place.  Can get 20 pound bags for 2.40.  Which is not bad, considering Costco is about 1.70 a bag.  The best part is I don't have to go all the way to Arrowhead to get ice.  Another interesting note is that the owner told me the 20 pound bags are more like 22 pounds.  They also sell reverse osmosis, filtered water at .30 a gallon.  Bring your own jugs or you can buy them here.  What really attracted me to this place you ask??  The Thrifty ice cream sign.  I am a sucker for ice cream and it has been years since I have had Thrifty ice cream.  So in I went and enjoyed a scoop of Rocky Road goodness for $1.80 on a cone. If you are looking for ice, filtered water, or some ice cream to cool off in Surprise this could be your next destination.  They are open 7:30 to 7 Monday through Friday and Saturday 10 to 5 I believe.  Sunday is a no go so stock up before.
5	Great place
