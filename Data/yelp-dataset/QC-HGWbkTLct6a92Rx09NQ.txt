4	I used to buy some dope drum n bass records here.
4	Can't Find a record shop? Thats because theirs only a handful in the AZ area.  LWR has weathered the storm over the years when downloading has crushed local music stores.  The selection is more for  House, Trance, Drum & Bass and more.  Not so much hip hop.  Services, turntable repair, and mixer repair. Personally I don't know of any other place that does this.
1	Another vinyl-retailer casualty...I'm sad to see it go, because I am pretty old school and I do appreciate being able to get good releases on wax, but truth be told, I only bought one record from this place in the 6+ years that I've lived here. I never came across much here that caught my fancy, but there was always an abundance of boring 4/4 house in just about every boring subgenre you could imagine(progressive, tech, blah blah blah).
3	One of the few places you can still pick up records! they have alot of Dub-step, house, kinda stuff.. I was hoping to find some older hip hop but no such luck. Still super casual and nice vibe going on in there.
