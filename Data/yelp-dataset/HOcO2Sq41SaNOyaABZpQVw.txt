2	This is the place to go... when you need another spare outfit prior to going clubbing... Disposable one time wear? Check!Cheap prices? Check!Carries stuff that a girl will look hot in when the beer goggles are on? CHECK!Will stand up to one delicate wash cycle in the washing machine? Nope!
3	This store is cramped and triggers my claustrophobia. They have tons of merchandise and prices are OK. I'm a Forever 21 type of gal these days. Unfortunately Charlotte Russe designs their clothes to look cheap. I only go to CR for the jewelry, not bad.
4	This place was big, wide selections on clothes. good deals. cant beat that! the line does get long and they dont have much cashier, when i went -they only had 2 cashiers when there were more than 10 people in line. people are on the go in vegas so it would be nice to have more cashiers so people can just buy and leave instead of waiting forever to be rung up. PRICE for sure is CHEAP! clothes are CUTE! the only thing is that its big but there is so mch selections that it gets crammed up. barely any space to walk and you end up bumping into people.
