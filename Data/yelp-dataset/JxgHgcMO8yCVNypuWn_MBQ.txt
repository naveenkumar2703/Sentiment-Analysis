3	Cilantro Rack in conveniently located downstairs from my office off of Silverado Ranch and Maryland Parkway in the Smith's shopping center. It opened in late March, and I decided to check it out during a lunch break. It's a Mom and Pop type of deal that specializes in discounted clothing and accessories. This store kind of reminds me of a Factory 2 U. It's not as "dirty" as Fallas Parades, but definitely not a Burlington's or TJ Maxx. They offer clothing for women of all sizes and men as well. I did see a couple of decent brands in the store, and nothing was priced over $19.99.I am personally not a fan of the clothing they sell, but they clerk did say they did get new stuff in all the time. An update may be coming soon.
3	I can't get my leg in any of this stuff.  So I guess if your a small petite size women, this store might work for you!Only thing I could fit is a purse!  lol
4	I love their summer dresses, i bought like 8 of them, nice cotton fabric and very well prices!  I actually had the change to meet the owner and they were super nice!  I do have to say most of the other stuff didn't fit me, since I'm an XL, but their summer dresses are fantastic!
5	I love the clothes here. You can buy anything for anyone of all ages. They have styles for all ages: women, teens/juniors for boys and girls, a small section for kids, men, there's also a section for people who wear plus sizes. The clothes they have are very good quality brands for up to 60% off! From formal to casual to work attire to swimwear and more, I think they have it all! The staff are really friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend anyone to stop by and check It out.
4	They have a very large selection of clothes but you do have to look through to find the right things. Run by really friendly staff who are very helpful and not too pressuring. I would go back for sure.
