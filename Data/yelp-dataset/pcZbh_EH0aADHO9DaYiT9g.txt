4	I would like to start this review by informing you that I am not an accessories-type of girl. I love them on other people, but I have never been able to really effectively style myself using accessories. Maybe it's the minimalist in me? Or maybe I'm just boring...Anyhoo...with that said, this place is HEAVEN for anyone looking to accessorize their outfit, man or woman. (Yes, they had a table dedicated to masculine accessories). The store has every necklace, bracelet, or ring you can imagine. And it's all nicely organized and separated as such. There were also some incredibly large, intricate pieces that you don't usually see in most stores.They continue the Patty's Closet tradition by limiting the number of pieces per style and offering customers 20% off discount cards.This particular location is right next door to a Patty's Closet boutique, allowing you to kill two birds...so to speak.
