3	Have you ever noticed that almost every florist uses the same pictures on their website and somehow they are all connected to Teleflora?  One of these days I'll figure out why and how this all works... but in the meantime, since I don't have a go-to florist that I use regularly, I use whatever company is most convenient at the time.So, when I recently wanted to send flowers to a friend of mine that was staying at the Montelucia, and the concierge told me that they use Garden of England, I went with it... I was not a fan of the $10 delivery charge, but so be it... I'm told the arrangement was colorful and beautiful... and of course it was a nice surprise for my friend upon her arrival.  I'll go direct next time for sure though - there is nothing like a personal touch - especially with flowers!
5	I live in California and was looking for a local florist in Phoenix to send a friend an arrangement, I looked on Yelp and found the Garden of England Flower shop and decided to give them a call. I want to thank all the people that recommended this florist! When I called the owner answered and was very friendly, she made some suggestions for the arrangement and scheduled the delivery for the same day. I didn't see the arrangement but I did get a call from my friend a few hours later thanking me for the "gorgeous floral arrangement". I will definitely use Garden of England again if I ever need so send flowers in the Phoenix area again and I highly recommend this florist.
