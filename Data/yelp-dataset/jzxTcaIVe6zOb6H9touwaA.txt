4	This subway is the best one in my immediate area. They have a knowledgeable staff and get your order right without any flack. The store is clean and well kept, and the service is quite friendly. Great quick meal and in my opinion a healthier option then pizza or burger king nearby.
4	Same as every other subway but it's always clean inside and they are pretty fast at making orders.
4	Always friendly, they always greets you, clean, lots of tables, right next to SafeWay
2	Usually I really enjoy subway, but my last visit wasn't ideal. My preferred sandwich is a veggie and cheese with extra cheese and add avocado. The young man working there the other evening grabbed the package of avocado and there visibly wasn't enough for 2 scoops, probably not enough for one scoop, so he took the spreader and got what he could from the edges and put it on my sandwhich which resulted in a very thin layer with several inches uncovered. I should have said something but didn't as the charge for avocado on a footlong is $1.50. This sandwhich was just under $9 and had little flavor as I don't add sauces or oil/vinegar since the avocado usually add the creaminess, flavor and moisture to the bread. I think I'm done with this subway.
1	Just went in and had the absolute worst customer service ever at subway. Just because you probably got stuck working a Sunday night doesn't mean you have to emit that bitterness to the customer. I walked in and waited forever for someone to come out from back. Then someone finally came and this skinny white dude didn't even acknowledge my prescence. No hi, nothing! Long story short the kid made my sandwich with attitude. Never makes for a yummy sandwich! Now it's a shit sandwich which I'm still going to eat because I'm hungry! Ha. Then he checks me out and doesn't even hand me my sandwich and bag, I had to practically reach  over the counter to get it. Maybe if you're so unhappy with your life you should do something about it!
