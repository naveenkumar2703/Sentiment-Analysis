4	As a hardcore Yelper, I find it a responsibility to place a park or business on Yelp if there is no listing. When I was walking in Southern Highlands back on July 13, I saw that Jimmy Pettyjohn was not on Yelp. It is now and Lavi. S has reviewed it. Jimmy Pettyjohn Park is a 1.09 acre park in Southern Highlands at the northeast corner of Southern Highlands Parkway at Valley View Boulevard. It is a park serving the local community. It does a good job at this. It is fully gated, which is a good thing if you have little children. There is a state-of-of-the-art shaded playground, shaded gazebo, green grass,  rest rooms, and attractive preipheral landscaping. In the summer, Jimmy Pettyjohn Jr. Park features night time movies.  When I rate community/neighborhood parks, I rate them differently than regional parks. Due to the tiny size, I am very picky. I look at the condition of the grass and equipment,  connectivity to adjacent land uses, and surrounding area. Jimmy Pettyjohn Park scored well on all of the above. The grass is a perfect shade of green. The playground, gazebo, picnic tables, and equipment were in prime condition. Although there is a need for a parking lot, the park connects nicely with the Southern Highlands community. On my visit, it was part of a hike that included the Paseo Walking Path. And the surrounding neighborhood appears to be safe with graffiti being relatively nonexistent.  I am impressed with Jimmy Pettyjohn Jr. Park. However, I will not drive out of my way to Southern Highlands to visit it. It is a park that functions more as a community green space for Southern Highlands residents instead of Yelpers such as myself that reside in another part of the valley.
5	This park is one of my favorites in Southern Highlands. It is extremely quiet, secluded, and beautifully maintained. They have a great variety of things to do. They also have an outdoor movie show in the summer!
