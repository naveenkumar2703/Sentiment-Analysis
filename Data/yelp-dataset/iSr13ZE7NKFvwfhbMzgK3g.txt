4	An initial good sign of any business is proper, friendly and enthusiastic phone answering skills. Budget delivered. Another good sign is the person pronouncing your name correctly. "Yes Thomas how can I help you?"...as oppossed to "Yes Tom how cany I help you?" I totally don't care you called me Tom, hell, you can call me Nancy Drew for all I care, but it shows you are LISTENING! A lost skill, don't ya think? I gave Joe my request. Which was pretty unique. I needed decals applied to a tinted window on my patio. Something to spice it up. We tried ourselves and those little decals bubbled more than a flapjack on a hot griddle in Atlanta in Julyyyy! I've never been to Atlanta or referred to pancakes as flapjacks. Something I just channeled so it seems. The work, by Jeremy was excellent. The follow up by Joe and his wife, visiting my establishment was unsurpassed. And greatly appreciated. So look for the good signs in any company. Politeness. Good work. Follow through. It happened to me. It will happen to you with Budget Signs.
1	Wlaked into this place and the guy comes out right away, and asks what I need. I tell him, and right about then his cellphone rings. He spends the next 5 minutes on a personal call, without acknowledging me once ("be right with you", "sorry about this", etc). All I did was walk into his store and try to do business with him, so I can certainly see how a personal call should take precedence. This place must have all the work they can handle-- try someplace where they value your business.
5	DJ and the guys were able to accommodate a special request and they did it blistering fast time. They suggested the best materials for the job (unlike FastSigns) and they went the extra mile to get my project done quickly and within a reasonable budget. I will be coming back! Thanks guys! Craig
