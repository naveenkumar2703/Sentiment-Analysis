3	Izzi's is alright. I wouldn't rush out to dine here. Their sushi is great if you are new to the cuisine, but really, it is just a little bit boring, but on the plus side, it does taste much more fresh than other establishments. The first time we went there, the best part of the meal was a prawn and fish roe salad - the last time, the dish was pretty stingy on content and heavy on the mayonnaise. Fusion restaurants don't tend to tempt me - stick to making one cuisine good rather than trying to please everyone, it never really works that well. Extra star for the Japanese tea, not enough places serve it.
