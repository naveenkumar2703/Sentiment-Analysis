3	DC Ranch is a very upscale, open air street mall with a large number of expensive restaurants and night life which bills itself as Arizona's premier golf course community, located nearby.The main drag is called Market Street and has Fleming's Steakhouse, Heirlooms American Restaurant, West Addison, Grimaldi's Pizza, The French Bee, The Herb Box and yes, a Krisy Kreme's and much more.
4	We came to DC Ranch because we had a hankering for pizza, and our aunt assured us that Grimaldi's in DC Ranch was the place to go. Who were we to argue?We got to DC Ranch after dark, so it was very prettily lit up, with lights around trees and all that. Even though it was dark, we could tell that this was an upscale kind of place, based on the numerous higher-end restaurants (Fleming's Steakhouse, The French Bee, The Herb Box, etc.) and the plethora of Mercedes, BMW, Lexus, and Cadillac Escalades all around. I'm sure if I could afford it, I'd live in the nearby community. DC Ranch is very quiet and classy and pretty and appealing. I would definitely come back to try some of other restaurants we walked by while waiting for our table at Grimaldi's. The little park in the middle was very cute, and great place to sit and enjoy the lovely evening.
4	We went in for lunch and shared the brown-sugar pork sandwich and the short rib taco both amazing.
