4	They are wholesale to the trade, but are very helpful to home DIY guys. The is the best spot in town to get swamp cooler supplies.
4	These guys rock. I needed to get a new fan motor for my heatpump and they checked around and got me a good price on one. When I showed up to pay for it, one of them actually drove to the place they were ordering it from and picked it up for me so I could have it that day. They were also offering to give me a free capacitor for it, but it wasn't necessary.Only negatives: I waited a full week after telling them to go ahead and order it because they never mentioned that I'd have to pay up-front. Simple miscommunication.NOTE: their hours on Yelp are not currently accurate; they close at 4:30pm.
