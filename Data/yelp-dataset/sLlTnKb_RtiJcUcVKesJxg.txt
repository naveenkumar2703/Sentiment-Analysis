3	Arguably serve the best coffee in Stockbridge. Very small inside with a few tables (you'd be lucky to find one free...I'm yet to be so lucky).Really friendly staff hidden behind a really high counter, those people under 5'10" may do better looking through the display cabinet than trying to see over it when ordering!
