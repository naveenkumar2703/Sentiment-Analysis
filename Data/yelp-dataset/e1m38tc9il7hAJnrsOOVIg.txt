1	If these supermarkets see the future as all customers using self service checkouts, as appears to be the case with more and more of these individual scanning stations being installed, then please, please, please make these things work! I spent 10 minutes today trying to pay for 6 items where every time I scanned an item the system went on hold until a customer service employee came over to over-ride the system. Poor customer service, poor customer experience, not good enough.
