5	Fantastic selection of cacti at a very happy price.  I really enjoyed browsing this guy's huge collection.  He was very willing to help me out in selecting something that I liked and had an excellent knowledge of what he had and exactly where he had it.  I'd definitely come back and I recommend a trip here even if you aren't really in the market for expanding your garden.
5	The selection and quality here is excellent and worth a drive from anywhere in the valley.
5	As others have noted, Richard has a huge selection of cacti in from 1 gallon to 24" box containers.  He has an expert's knowledge of plants and is happy to help customers select the plants that will best meet their needs.  His prices are excellent.  It was a pleasure to do business at Phoenix Desert Nursery, and I would not hesitate to go back for more purchases or to refer my friends to PDN.
