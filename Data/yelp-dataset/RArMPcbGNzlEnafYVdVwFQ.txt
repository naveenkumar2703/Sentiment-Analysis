4	I have used this location several times to clean bedding. They have made drop off and pick up so easy. You get in and out quickly with nice clean items. I also love how the staff comes out to your car to pick up and drop off your items.
3	They do a good job, just very very expensive!!!
4	Cleaned and ready to go!!I had not seen a review for a while so I thought I'd throw my two cents in.Located on rampart and lake mead, this dry cleaners is in a fairly decent strip mall next to a Pappa johns, Big Lots, Roberto's and a PTs pub.Opened everyday of the week, I have found this Dry cleaners to be prompt and a fair price. Dropping off a couple of business shirts and a suit the total was around $23 bucks. A little bit more expensive than some other places but the service is great and turn around being 24hrs, I can't complain to much. I was going to give just 3 stars, but considering they have a dry thru pick up and drop off I've bummed it up. Drive thru cleaning is kinda coolOverall:Service/ 5-5Price: 3-5Back again: YuP!
4	I came here because they were open on a Sunday and they could get my clothes cleaned quickly which I need for a road trip. The people were friendly the clothes came out clean it's a little expensive but it's a first-class business.
