1	Even though I was nursing a hangover and in need of crappy, greasy food, this was a letdown!  First off service was so slow and the cashier was utterly lackadaisical in her attitude.  Oh well, what did I really expect...
4	Not bad. Pan pizzas weren't cut all the way through, and of course no knives in the airport, but hot and fresh and everything it needed to be.
2	The food was old, but what do you expect at an airport late in the evening.
