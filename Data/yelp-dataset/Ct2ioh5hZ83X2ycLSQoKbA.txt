4	Moe's is yet another quick Mexican joint, along the lines of Qdoba or Chipotle.  That said, Moe's is pretty good.  It seems lower fat than the others, and they actually offer tofu.  I would die for a good vegetarian mexican food place sometimes, and I think Moe's may be my go-to.THAT said, don't get the tofu.  It is mushy and amateurish - it needs to be crisped on the grill (no fat is required).  One less star for the yucky tofu, Moe's.I had a "Personal Trainer" salad.  It was FAN TASTIC.   I would definitely get it again.  Moe's has a great selection of fresh toppings, and their dressings were good.  The salsa was YUM!I can't wait to go back when I get my next Mexican food craving.
2	Moe's in general are pretty decent serving up quick, cooked to order mexican. Not the greatest but neither should your expectations be when you are ordering at the counter. That said this Moe's seems to be one of the worst, it is a more ghetto, greasier version than the rest. They don't serve beer at this Moe's and it is usually pretty dirty. DON"T get the tofu, apparently the concept of extra firm has not hit Moe's.. I'm not putting it in a smoothie, I'm putting it in a burrito and I don't want it dripping out. The salsa is runny. Yuck.
