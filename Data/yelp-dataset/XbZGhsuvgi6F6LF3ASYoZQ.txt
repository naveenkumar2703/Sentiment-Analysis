5	very happy thank you
5	Great Optometrist. He took his time to get me the right prescription and also informed me about new cheaper options for my daily contact lenses. I would recommend coming here.
5	So I went here last week for a walk in eye exam because I have had trouble seeing distances for a while. I was in the actual exam in probably less than ten minutes. I have never had glasses before, or even an exam, so this was all very new to me. I found out I did need them and the preview I got was excellent. I didn't realize I could see such things. Haha The doctor was very nice and explained everything to me very well. I will return here again definitely and I recommend anyone to go here.
5	Great place. Quick and simple. Eye exam was fast and thorough. Walked out with my contacts :) will be returning and will recommend to others
