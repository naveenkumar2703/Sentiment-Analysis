5	I really thought those make-it-and-take-it pottery places were a dumb idea when they first came out. My grandmother had a "real" ceramics studio, and I knew just anyone couldn't walk in off the street and learn to clean and paint ceramics. Guess you could call me a ceramics snob.Anyways. Last year I was in charge of our high schools' all-nighter grad party, and went canvassing the shops in the area of downtown chandler for support. I was very impressed with Mind Over Splatter -- both with their cheery yellow-walled studio and with the owners, Kelley and Lisa. They donated several studio fees and I resolved to give them a try. Now I am a fan. Mind Over Splatter is a terrific place to get your creative groove on. Try your hand at painting pottery, or create a one-of-a-kind mosaic masterpiece. Every Wednesday is "Friends Day" with 2 for 1 fees. Great for a date or an outing with the kids.

1	I never got a call that my pieces were ready for pick-up. The newspaper article said the pieces were at DiSciacca until June 26. I went on June 19 and they've been picked up. I have no contact info as the phone and website have been disconnected. Disappointed, as one was a gift.
