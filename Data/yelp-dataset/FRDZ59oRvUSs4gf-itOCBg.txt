3	This Jack in the Box is such a cool design/location...It is under a huge building and has a drive thru... I don't think there are any other Jack's that are like it... It has all the same food as all the other locations but I just love the layout Service is good here
5	Had a major late night craving. Since Jack in the Box has late hours I went through the drive thru. I was immediately greeted and my order was placed on the screen right. As I drove up to the window the cashier was friendly and took my money. Given a receipt along with my change my food was quickly prepared. This late night snack was the Chicken Fajita Pita. Mighty tasty I have to say. My food was hot and fresh. I will be back again.
3	Not that great, none of tables were cleaned off. They also got my order wrong. The lady was nice, just didn't seem very clean.
