4	Non chain ballroom dance studio.  Very good teachers, a very approachable environment.
5	I have taken several lessons here and really enjoyed myself.  I didn't think that I could really learn to dance at my age, but they proved me wrong.  I just went to their dance show and it was a lot of fun.  I definitely will continue to take lessons here as I am having a great time!!!
5	I bought some dance lessons for my daughter and myself for her birthday.  (No! That wasn't all I gave her.)  They are wonderfully friendly, and made me feel comfortable when I was a bit nervous to actually have to show my lack of skill.  We had four lessons and  still have two private lessons to attend.  Firstly, they have skilled dancers who are patient and attentive. Secondly, the group was small so they spent a lot of time with each student. And lastly, they are very affordable.  So, there ya have it. I would highly recommend this place if you want to learn how to follow (Which I have a huge problem with being the control freak that I am.) or be the lead.
5	The new owners are amazing people. You will get quality dancing for the price. Rick and Julie are true professionals mixed with lots of love. If you in the East Valley def. try them out!
