5	I have been coming to NODIS for about three months now - I am hooked, committed!  They have the most unique fitness regimen I have ever experienced, and I have tried many different fitness centers and physical therapists.  I really feel like I am being helped, and I am having a good time. I am sort of afraid to tell people about NODIS, but not being selfish, I have to because it is that good!  Look it up at theshifter.com.
