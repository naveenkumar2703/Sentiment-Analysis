3	A place that specializes in Musubi?!  Wow!  A handful of my guy friends mentioned such an idea to me, and imagine their disappointment when I told them someone else beat them to the punch!We see this place all the time as we dine next door at Swish.  We decided to grab an order to go to see what the fuss was all about.Taking advantage of their $8.08 special, it included a spam musubi, mac salad, two choices of entree and rice.  From the pics, it looks like we got the Krispy Chicken Krunch (chicken rolled in a seasoned battered, fried and topped with a special glazed sauce) and the Samoan Sami (seasoned corned beef and spinach, baked in coconut milk).  We weren't exactly sure how the order was going to come out, and hoped that it would be easy to eat later on.  When the order arrived to go, it was quite a few boxes and we realized this would not make it into the theater as we had hoped.  Bringing it home, some of the Samoan Sami had already come out of the box and was making a mess in the plastic bag.  The presentation of the food was alright.  I guess when you finally assemble it altogether, it looks a lot more appetizing.When it came down to it, it was more of a bento box dinner with Hawaiian influences.  I guess we were confused with it being a musubi place and thought the chicken and beef would be incorporated into a musubi of some kind.The spam musubi did taste good, and the Samoan Sami had a nice taste to it too. The chicken wasn't crunchy by the time we got home, so it was okay.Overall, we just had different expectations from we actually got.(Pics posted!)
1	Came here based on the other reviews from Yelp, but guess what?  It's closed.  Out of business.  Shut its doors.  Stupid recession.  No federal bailout money for small-time Musubi restaurants.
