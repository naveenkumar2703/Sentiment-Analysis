5	Absolutely gorgeous condos.  This is my next r.e. purchase.......depressed 5 star Vegas property.   You cannot imagine the views from the balcony and the quality of construction.  Hey, Warren Buffet would be all over this , but it's too late because Carl Icahn already is!
2	This place is physically amazing; however, Stephanie in customer service is awful.  She is rude and does not care about taking care of her tenants or their guests.
5	Stephanie is amazing and goes on and above foer every owner!  Stephanie ALWAYS puts owners as a priority!
5	Amazing building! Beautifully designed.  Wonderful staff. All of the units are are unique with great views and a great design. I highly recommend living there.
