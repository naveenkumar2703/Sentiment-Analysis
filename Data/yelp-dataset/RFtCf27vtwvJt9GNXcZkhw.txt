5	I love Safeway.Sure it may be a little pricier than the competition but it makes up for it with wide isles, great parking, friendly service and a wonderful selection.Plus, because its a California based store, they have It's It's, located in the frozen food section - Oatmeal cookies with a quality vanilla ice-cream in the center all dipped in chocolate - soooo gooood.
4	This Safeway is much larger than the Desert Foothills and Chandler Boulevard location, wider variety of produce and other products. Newly renovated. Very clean. Even the bathrooms, hah!I don't even live in this area anymore, and still find myself shopping here! What the heck?!  Probably doesn't help that it's near work and the gym. Super convenient for picking up last minute ingredients I need for dinner that night, heck, even just changing out of my sweat drenched clothes from a workout if I have a "Pain and Torture appointment" with my Physical TERRORIST "friend" right down the street . . . There's also a Starbucks here for all you coffee freaks. The nicest lady works there. Knows my drink now. Sometimes I don't even have to tell her unless I'm changing it up. Oh yeah! Friendly employees, convenient, and overall a pleasant shopping experience so obviously I'll be back.
5	Our grocery store of choice in the area!
