5	I am so relieved the search is over! Cindy and Meghan totally rock. They excelled not only in response time, communication and promptness, but in the cleaning and multiple tasks that I needed done. I am pretty discerning, and continue to be impressed. Genuinely kind, extremely friendly ladies that take extreme pride in themselves, their business and their finished work. I will be using constantly and whole heartedly recommend "Just Ask Meghan."
