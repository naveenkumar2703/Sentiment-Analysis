5	I've used Sears Carpet Cleaning for the last 4 years and they do an AMAZING job! Luis is their senior technician and he's professional, friendly, and knowledgeable. I ask for Luis every year I get my carpets and tile cleaned!
5	We have lived in our house for three years and never cleaned carpets outside of regular vacuuming and spot cleaning. Needless to say, it was about time. After seeing their fair prices and reading reviews online, I decided to call up Sears and schedule an appointment. The day of the appointment arrived and I was very pleased to find that the technicians arrived promptly at 10am. (Their service window was 10am-12pm.) The technicians quickly took a look around and then set to work. 30 minutes later my carpet was immaculate! Seriously, the last time it was this clean was when we moved in. Everything was spotless! Best part was it did not cost me an arm and a leg! I am so excited I made the decision to call Sears and will be using them in the future for all my carpet cleaning!
4	The carpets came out great and dried quicker than expected. I wanted to give them 5 stars, but Luis was clearly disappointed when I didn't go for the upsell.
5	I just had my rug cleaned by Sears & they did an excellent and professional job.Luis was courteous; on time & professional and went out of his way to make sure I was completely happy, and I was. Thanks Sears cleaning.
5	I just had my carpet cleaned by Juan and Jose. These guys were awesome. No pressure, totally professional, polite and clean. I will recommend them to anyone.
