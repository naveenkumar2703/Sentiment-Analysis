5	There is NOTHING like this in the marketplace.  I love going to outdoor fests, events, and this is awesome!!!  I actually don't have to 'hold it' anymore.  I also LOVE that they give a portion of their proceeds to charity.  In this economy, you don't see that that often.  Now, if we could only have these everywhere I go.  Even restaurants and stores don't have restrooms as nice as this!
5	MUST USE!!!   Recently, had the option to use Porta Jane at a recent outdoor concert (Extreme Thing) What a difference!!! Seriously, these port-a-potty's are great.  No Smell, and surprisingly clean inside.  There's even a mirror on the back of the door.  You do have to donate at least a dollar to use, but it's for charity.  Honestly, I was so happy to see the Pink that I gave the guy a $5 and told him to keep it.  It's worth it!!  I would highly recommend anyone having a special event to use these instead.  Even with the donation there was still a line of people waiting to use them.
