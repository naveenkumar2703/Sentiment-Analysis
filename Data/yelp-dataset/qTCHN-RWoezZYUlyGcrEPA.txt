5	Katia is AMAZING. I have been brazilian waxing for more than 13 years. I have a sensitive bikini area and am prone to ingrowns which have gotten worse recently. My friends told me about sugaring and I figured I would try it. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO WAXING. Sugaring is far less painful and the irritation is wayyyyy less. Additionally Katia explained everything, gave upkeep tips, was quick and efficient. I highly recommend getting sugared by Katia!
5	I started seeing Katia a little over a year ago.  At first, I chose my own facials from the list of services, but within the first couple of months, I learned that Katia's recommendations can always be trusted.  Now, I simply make an appointment and ask, "What are we doing today?"  I've tried many of her body treatments also. I particularly recommend dermaplaning and the crystalline masque facial.
5	I wont get facials with anyone but Katia! She's Fantastic!! I had major skin issues to the point where I was beginning to give up. Bi-monthly visits with Katia changed my skin completely. Thank you Katia, you are amazing!
5	I had a facial with the lovely Katia  and let me just say that she is amazing! Very detail oriented and knowledgable. I left her shop feeling elated and my skin looks amazing! I will definitely recommend her and can't wait to come back to Las Vegas and doing my facial, sugaring and makeup with Katia again.
