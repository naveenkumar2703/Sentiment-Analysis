3	I've never seen this place open. It's always closed whenever I venture along. My friends keep recommending it to me, they must have a special key or be playing an extremely elaborate joke on me. Can anyone update us on the situation?
4	La Croissanterie is a great bakerie come deli which offers friendly, fast service and all of their produce is fresh and tasty.  They have a massive range of freshly baked bread in the shop every day and the smell is amazing as you walk in.  Their long baguettes are incredible and are perfect for making massive sandwiches with when you get home.  Alternatively, you get them to fill it with a huge range of fillings, including cured meats, seafood, all the salad bits and a great selection of sauces.  I had a turkey, salad and mayonnaise baguette which was jam packed with it all and was delicious and moist.  La Croissanterie is a good place to come for reasonably priced, delicious bread and great produce.
4	Really like this place freindly staff and good food. I pass it on my way to the office and occassionally pop in for a bacon roll and an espresso. Never had the lucnh items but the breakfast rolls are great.
