5	the tahitian dance class on mondays is a workout!!!
5	Studio Ohm is a great new yoga and dance studio.  It's located just off the 215 & Rainbow exit. Stop in and chat with the owner Naomi, an absolute goddess! She offers many classes like cardio salsa, belly dance, Spanish Flamenco, Argentine tango, yoga, and pole dance. I've been taking  the Tribal belly dance class on Mondays with Marisa,my abs and buns are sore after that class! Saturday mornings they have beginner Flamenco with Coral! You will SWEAT! Drop in fees are $15 per class or they offer packages! Definitely worth checking out!
4	Studio Ohm offers yoga, pilates, dance, and most importantly pole dancing classes!  They have special group classes where you and your friends can twirl on a pole without strangers gawking at any awkwardness!The class starts off with some warm up, floor work, and sexy moves for when you fall off the pole.  Then the second half of the class is all about pole dancing and doing tricks that you can bust out that evening at any Vegas club where you can find a pole.  I really enjoyed this 1.5 hour class more than the intro S Factor classes, due to the fact that you learn a lot more on the pole and the sexy moves are a bit tamer...it's not about closing your eyes and touching your body in a "sexy" way and blah blah blah...it's about FUN!The only downside is this studio is a $15-20 taxi ride from the strip.  Make sure you know where you're going as some taxis don't know where it is.  Also, tell your taxi driver to come back once the class is over.  Bottled water is offered for $1.  Our party planner brought cupcakes for us and that was the perfect snack!  Make sure you wear comfortable yoga clothes, aren't hungover, and ready for a slight workout!
