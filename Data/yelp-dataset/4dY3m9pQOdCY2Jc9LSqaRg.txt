5	I'm new to Las Vegas and I don't have health insurance but I'm a diabetic that needs her medication. I went to this office and the staff was excellent and got me right in. The doctor was knowledgeable, courteous and friendly. I will have to say that this was one of my best medical appointments to date.Two thumbs Up! from this patient
3	Had a TB shots because I accidentally poked myself with the same syringe I used to inject my roommates dog with insulin and had a panic attack! Thought I had caught rabies or something crazy!Came here and was seen right away. Staff was friendly and alert. Place was clean with a HUGE waiting area. The shot hurt like a mother-trucket but apparently it's expected.
2	The thing that annoys me is that, yes there's barely a wait after you sign in, but once they bring you into an exam room, you sit there for 30 mins waiting for the doctor to come look at you for less than 2 mins. Sucha waste of time. All other urgent cares I've been to has a longer wait time in the lobby but once you were called in, the nurses and doctors attend to you right away. And honestly, I don't think these doctors care much. They talk so fast you can't even understand them, then they go "bye" and off to the next
