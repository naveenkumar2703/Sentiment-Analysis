5	Absolutely love this salon! I have very thick curly hair so it's hard for me to find a stylist I trust my hair with. Sophie is so genuine and sweet and does a phenomenal job on my haircuts as well as all the color that I am always changing. Chad is also an amazing stylist who takes the time to make sure what you ask for is everything you'll love and more. The two of them together are an amazing duo and I couldn't be more thrilled to have finally found a salon that I can trust. Not to mention their salon decor is beyond adorable and very tasteful. Give them a try and I promise you'll never go anywhere else again!!
5	By far the most comfortable I've ever felt in a Salon.  Very welcoming and real people who own the place. Such a cool vibe. Always leave looking good and feeling great! A tremendous value compared to other salons in town.  Great job Sugar Free!
5	Love going here. The stylists are really fun and friendly. They are clearly passionate about their jobs and they love animals!
