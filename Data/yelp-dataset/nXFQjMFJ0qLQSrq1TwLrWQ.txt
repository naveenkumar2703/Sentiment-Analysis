4	If you need a hat, this is where to go.
3	I've been a member of the Hat Club since 2007.  At first, it was the only place to find hats with the Philippine flag on it.  But since the Manny Pacquiao phenomenon hit the US, you can find the flag just about anywhere.Except in Chandler.If you're a fan of Negro league teams or Triple A teams, then stick to online merchants because you won't find those hats here either.  It's become apparent to me that all Hat Clubs aren't created equally and the Chandler location is perhaps the worst I've ever seen.  Their saving grace is that they carry other NFL teams aside from the Cardinals, including the NY Giants (in multiple colorways).So why the 3 stars?Well...I am still a member...
1	I purchased a SF Giants and tried to return it a week later. cashier said there were "sweat stains" on it and i explained to him that i tried it only once at home and never wore it outdoors at all. here's a tip, be sure to check for "sweat stains" before buying a hat at The Hat Club.
