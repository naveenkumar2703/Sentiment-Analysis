5	Fabulous affordable haircare. I haven't had a bad cut from them, ever. Locally owned and operated, so if you are looking to shop local this is the place. Every time I get my hair cut here I get compliments.
5	Been going to Dawn (the owner) for more years than I care to admit now--she's the best! Always great cuts and color. Everyone is super friendly and fun. Great for kids, my girls have been going since their first haircuts.If you're looking for a fancy place where one person washes your hair and another only does the color and another one does your cut, and they serve you mimosas and give you backrubs, this isn't the place to go. But it is a local, friendly neighborhood place where you'll get great results for a really good price.
5	Dawn does the best Brazilian waxes in Madison! I moved to Madison five years ago, and called the Anaala salon for a wax. They couldn't get me in so I asked for a recommendation and they pointed me to Euphoria salon. I haven't looked back! Dawn made the whole process so easy, quick, and painless. Seriously, she's done in 15 minutes and does a great job. Also, the price is unbeatable-- $42!!! So much cheaper and less awkward than what I've paid everywhere else.She also does great highlights and color for such a reasonable price - $75.She is busy so I always book my next appt before I leave.
