5	For honesty, 5 big-ass stars. There ARE honest mechanics. Took my car in this morning to ask for an estimate to replace my brakes which have been screeching to high heaven. They took a look and told me I probably have 20K miles left before I'll need them replaced; it's just the pad compound that makes a lot of noise. Since I only have only 24K miles on the current brakes, this made me quite happy. They gave me their car "for when you really do need us".
5	I should have written this review years ago. This place is really great. I have been bringing our family vehicles here for the better part of the last decade. They are fast, friendly, and I have never had any issues with the repairs. I used to price shop their rates, but since I consistently found their prices to be competitive, I don't feel the need to any more. It is so hard to find a good mechanic; I'm very happy to have A&B as a neighbor.
5	This is a great shop!  They are honest, thorough and also timely.  I have been bringing my car to them for the past three years, and they are amazing!  It isn't easy to find a reputable mechanic, but Jose at A & B is definitely one!! :)
