5	I love that I can order online and return in the store so as to avoid shipping charges.  And I always have coupons or Kohls cash.  Never have to wait in line.
4	I really like the quality of clothes at Kohl's and they are always having sales.  They also send me those $10 gift cards in the mail all the time.  I like to go and look for shirts that are originally around $30 but are on sale for 50% off and then with the gift card, I walk away with it for $5!  I always have a receipt where the savings total is higher than the payment total.They also have great trendy clothes for teen girls and nice clothes for men and boys.
