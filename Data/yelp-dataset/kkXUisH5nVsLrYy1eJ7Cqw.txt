5	im too in the middle of essays to put any time into writing in this- but will just say that this is the best fucking malaysian ive ever had in my life. what you dont know is that i rarely have eaten malaysian but what i know is that it is actually my new favorite restaurant in the entire uk.only about 7 tables so you call to reserve. the woman who works there is a pure delight. the laksa was fab. so were the spicy pork spring rolls and whatever the special chicken thing was. if you ask the delightful woman what the best thing on the menu is and she is consistent, she will recommend the chicken thing- a creamyish sauce. perfect. its not in the center center so if youre visiting it will require a bus or taxi- its worth it.
4	One of the best Malaysian meals I've had. Very cosy, little restaurant. The waitress is so helpful and a real treat. Food is amazing and at a really reasonable price. Highly recommended.
