1	Decent haircut. Rude service. They didn't seem to want to cut my eight-year-old's hair until I gave them my phone number and address. WTF? Dude just needed his ears lowered and I have to sign up for a mailing list? No thanks. Also, I hate big chains that don't take American Express...
5	Fast, friendly service. Courtney is amazing and was able to fix a bad haircut I received elsewhere and made great recommendations to continue the look I wanted at home.
4	For the "fast food" of hair saloons, if you pick a stylist and stick with them, it's OK. This location seems to be better run than others in the area. Can not breat the price and you get coupons in the mail to make it even cheaper!Don't forget to check in on line or through the phone app and your wait is minimal.
