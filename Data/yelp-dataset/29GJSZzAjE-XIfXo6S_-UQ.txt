3	Gleneagles is the first of many, many tourist stores travellers will see when they get off the train.One of the classier establishments specialising in tourist orientated goods, it is big on tartan, kilts and cashmere scarves. They have some nice postcards and prints for people looking for a nice trophy to remember Scotland by. Not really one for the locals but it has enough to appease people looking for the fine line between tacky and tasteful items (although I'm sure last time I was in here, a bit drunk, I was guffawing at the "See You, Jimmy" hats).Selling items a wee bit more sophisticated while not completely overlooking the silly stuff, Gleneages is a good shout for last minute presents (and a wee bag of rock for the train home, just like Steph pointed out!)
3	Some of the touristy-souvenir shops can be awful.  Gleneagles, in Edinburgh's Princes Street Mall is not one of them, and comes off rather well to the first time visitor like myself.Like all of the shops of this type, it has the normal range of gifts of every type, kind and colour.  The general feel of the shop is a lot less tacky than many of the others in the city.  I was drawn by the large range of shortbread - larger than I think I've seen in any other shop in the city.  I love a good bit of shortbread, but managed to restrain myself this time.Apart from the shortbread, and though the shop is well presented, the rest of the content is the same as you will find in all of the shops on the Royal Mile - I wonder if all of the shops just do a bulk order from one company that sells that sort of tacky things that fill these places.On the whole, it's the same old story as every other shop of this type, though this place is redeemed by good presentation.
