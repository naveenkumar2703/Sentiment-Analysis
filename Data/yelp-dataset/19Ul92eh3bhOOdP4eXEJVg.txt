5	This place is a very clean and well stocked Adult toy shop. They carry Gun Oil (major plus!). They have the newest toys and a wide variety for whatever suits your fancy. You may also peruse a decent selection of lingerie and cute stripper shoes! I always like to browse their jewelry selection as they have some really cute stuff and they don't mark the prices up 20x what they paid for it like most of these shops. Definitely one of the classiest adult stores around and the staff is friendly and helpful.
4	I was expecting this shop would get rundown over time because of the location but the outside and inside is still just as clean and orderly as when it opened.  This is the only shop of this kind I would go to on the west side.The prices are lower than Castle or Fascinations.  Although the Fascinations Superstore on Elliott has a much larger selection, I'm confident you can still find everything you need (or didn't know you need) at Secrets.
5	Paige was very nice and helped me found everything I needed to enjoy and have a Super hot Valentine's Day!
