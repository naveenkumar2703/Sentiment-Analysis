2	Not the fault of this location, I preface my review by stating we have the world's worst mail carrier.  I'm pretty certain I deliver more mail than he does.  We've found mail on the ground more than once, and if we're lucky it's our own.  We have a box with a top you rotate which apparently requires shoving everything in at once to ensure the mail is bent, torn, or destroyed.  Anytime he takes a rubber band off of a bundle, it's generously tossed in our driveway to save us a trip to Staples I'm sure.  And if that's not bad enough, he's probably the rudest guy you'll ever meet.  So anytime I go into a post office, I'm reminded how much I despise this guy.  Enter post office on McDowell.  There are a few good people there, but in general I think they require a prior history in used car sales.  Before I can get a word out of my mouth...Would you like overnight service?  No thanks, just priority mail.  What about insurance and delivery confirmation?  No thanks, just priority mail.  What about stamps, labels, shipping supplies or a prescription for Xanax?  No, just mail the damn package please.  Would you like cash back?  NO!!!!   But now I need a Xanax.
