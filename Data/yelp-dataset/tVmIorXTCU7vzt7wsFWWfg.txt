4	= = = = = = KFC DAILY BUFFET! = = = = = =Wow, it's been almost two years since getting around to this one, & that's too long!  So today, joined by Arlin B. & Mike C. it was a trip back down here for an amazing feast of fried & BBQ style chicken, mashed potatoes & gravy, macaroni & cheese, corn, chard, salad, cottage cheese, chicken fried steak, biscuits & all the other things that KFC serves.  (See more in my original review.)This buffet gives you all this plus help yourself beverages for only $7.99/$6.99 Sr.They did sometimes let something run out for a few minutes, but with that said, it was quite a lunch by the time we were finished, & I'd say this Buffet is not to be missed if you love good chicken!     :-))
4	Wow, it's been a long time since I've been to KFC, but I was craving some original recipe fried chicken. I ordered a three piece meal, but I noticed that they have a buffet for 7.99, which was more value for your money and a three piece meal and comes with all the different chickens, sides, drink and dessert! Great to know there is a KFC nearby to count on when I have a craving!
