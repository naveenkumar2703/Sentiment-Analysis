5	The best experience I had with my two children. It is a fun and exiting way to help your child learn about music and spend time together. It's a great program full of beautiful music and lots of fun. The best part of it is Mis. Brenlie she is WONDERFUL with the children and makes it so much fun.
5	LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. kindermusic with Miss Brenlie.  1 yeat later and  my daughter still sings the songs.   This exposed my daughter to music,  Miss Brenlie has a gift with music and kids.  Money well spent.
5	Kindermusik with Brenlie is the absolute best! I have two sons and have been going to her classes for 3 years and they adore her :)  It's a great way to introduce your little one to music and also connect with other parents.
