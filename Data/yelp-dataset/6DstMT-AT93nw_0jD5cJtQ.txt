5	I am a new patient and I can't say enough good things about the staff here. Everyone is so warm and welcoming and they do a great job of putting those like myself who tend to get anxious about going to the dentist at ease. Dr. Hillary Peck is very gentle and her work is beautiful!
5	Tooth Doctor...How about Truth Doctor! My experience at Peck Family Dentistry has compelled me to write this commentary. I finally found a dentist that is gentle, kind, and treats me like a person, and not just another warm body in the chair.  I went into the office for a focused dental problem. I met with Dr. Kevin Peck who was able to restore my tooth the same day because my treatment plan was not inflated unlike some other dental offices. He and the staff promptly addressed all of my dental concerns in a manner that I understood. My tooth was restored without the need to get numb-what a surprise! Because of the quality of care that I received, Peck Family Dentistry is the only place that I feel confident that I will have honest, reliable, and compassionate dental care.
5	We have been coming to Peck Family Dentistry for almost 20 years, what a great family practice. It took us a few dentists to find them when we first moved to the valley, but once we found out about Peck Family Dentistry we'd go nowhere else. Recently I had an emergency, an old filing came out and Dr. Kevin took care of me right then, 5 star service. If you are looking for a caring and top professional team/practice then I recommend The Peck Family Dentistry to anyone from kids to snowbirds!
