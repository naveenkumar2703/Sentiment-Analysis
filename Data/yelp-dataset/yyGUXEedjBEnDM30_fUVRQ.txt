5	Are you a blonde, or considering going blonde?  After years of frustration I finally found a hairdresser who is a genius with color! Her name is Lisa Fournier and she has been with Grandstrands for many years. I have been using her for almost 10 years.  Make sure that you plan ahead when making your appointments, as she is usually heavily booked! You will LOVE your color, and for those who have long hair, she isn't scissor happy like many hairdressers I have come across. I moved since starting to use her and now have a 35-40min. drive to get there, but it's worth it!
5	My children can be very shy but Craig knew exactly how to make them feel comfortable and they actually enjoyed their haircuts!  For a great cut and supreme customer service I definitely recommend Craig as a stylist.  He has been my hair consultant for many years!
5	Love it here! !! They listen and then do it....
5	I love this place! Professional, creative, up on the latest styles and reasonably priced. Kathy does my hair & she is amazing! Wouldn't dream of going anywhere else!
5	Love coming to kasia! She is fast and does a great job. I've been coming for a highlight and haircut for about 7 months now and come all the way from Gilbert. Her prices are low and she is worth the trip.
