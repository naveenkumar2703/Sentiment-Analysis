5	I was at Jam's Picket Fences event and Caroline from Boho Farm and Home was were.  She had homemade jams, fresh eggs, etc.  It was cool!  I got a jar of the raspberry rose jam.  My hubby LOVES it!  Caroline mentioned to check out her website too (www.BohoFarmandHome.com).  She participates at different events.  She offers tours by appointment only:  info@bohofarmandhome.com.
5	This is the jewel of Arcadia!  You can catch Caroline and her family's journey on her blog - http://www.bohofarmandhome.com/ and keep up with all the amazing events they host.  From small intimate dinners in the yard to her flea market..  Try to check one out.  This is a very unique place in the Valley of the Sun.
5	I first heard of Boho at the Yelp Pley Date event this year.  The couple had goat cheese and also some yummy marmalades/jams.  She gave me a pamphlet for the Garden Tour and so from that, I was pulled in to the world of Phoenix's very own residential garden world... who knew it was growing like this!Visited Boho Farm & Home today and felt like I was taken away in to some distant retreat that was NOT in Arizona.  Yes, it was hot, but the beautiful gardens, adorable animals, and gorgeous outdoor living space made me feel like I was not in hot Arizona.  So green was their farm - there was so much going on and I had a lot of fun figuring out what each plant and tree was (and what food it bore).  The chickens were free-roaming and it was just a very welcoming backyard farm experience.  They also had their products for sale (jams, etc) as well as served a yummy lavender-infused drink... very nice gifts for the moms in your life (Mother's day is tomorrow).If you can take a tour, do it!  It's beautiful and not like anything you'll see in any AZ backyard.. it simply takes you away.
