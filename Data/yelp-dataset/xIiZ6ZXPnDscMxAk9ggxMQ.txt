5	Saw this place while parking to get hair cut at franchise chain.  Decided to go here instead. Glad I did. Great local barbershop.  Very friendly.  Haircut price in line with competition.  Nice local owned business.  I didn't have cash on me and she said, "no problem, I'm here until six, just come back and pay me".  I did find some in my wallet but...how often do you hear that?
4	Conveniently located on Odana road. I got lucky and didn't have to wait long. The next person who had to come in had to come in the next day. It's a good idea to call in first and confirm Sandy's schedule.I showed Sandy pictures of the haircut I wanted and I think she was able to follow through, moderately priced, fast and simple cut.
4	Posting a quick update: I'm pretty much a regular now, it's just like all the other reviews said: Sandy is fast, cheap but attentive and very nice. She sometimes also keeps the store open past normal hours if there's an appointment too! Highly recommended.
