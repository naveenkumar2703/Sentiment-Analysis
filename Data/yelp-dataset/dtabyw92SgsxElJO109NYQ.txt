5	I became familiar with Citi Trends in Texas. I went looking for scrubs for work and a couple of cute tops for the club. Not only did I find inexpensive scrubs, but I found super cute and stylish clothes for church and the club!, They had Baby Phat and Apple Bottom to name a few. So happy they made it west! For us folks on a budget, they are a blessing!
4	Men,women, junior, children & infant clothes and shoes for all...ALL NAME BRAND quality stuff! This place is AWESOME! Receipt: 2 pairs of junior jeans, leather belt, 2 blouses, 7 (YES, 7!) bras, 4 mens shirts, set of 8 silver hoops and studs earrings, a group of silver bangle bracelets, 2 amazing candle sets.....Total= $109.00! The girls working there are super friendly and helpful...Will defianetly be back!
4	I went to this store the other day purely just to kill some time. I didn't expect to be too excited once I got it based on the appearance from the outside.But you know what they say, never judge a book by its cover. I would give this place a 5 star but they didn't offer shopping carts (like other discount clothing stores) and it is hard to shop with a 2 year old in hand. But they have fanstastic deals. Brand name (not knock off) for much cheaper, awesome prices. The selection for plus size women was just as nice as other departments which is hard to say for many other discount clothing stores. The kids section was amazing as well.Honestly, this store had many options and great deals for all departments. I even scored in the kids toys by getting 4 books for less than $1.50 each. I can't wait to come back!
