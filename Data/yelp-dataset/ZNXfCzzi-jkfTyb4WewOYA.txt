5	To be honest, I didn't really know what "Italian ice" was until I tried Scala's.  I had been imagining something like Hawaiian ice... roughly shaved, garish colors and flavors.  I was SO WRONG!Italian ice is delicate, smooth and delicious.  I had the mint chocolate chip... sweet, not too minty and wonderful.  My husband had the root beer, which was awesome too (and would have made a great float with soft serve, which they offer as well).If you are looking for a cool treat (and and a lighter, less filling alternative to ice cream) try Scala's.

4	Fat free and under 100 calories* (for 4 oz.) Italian ice is a light, refreshing ice cream alternative to help lower the body temps. We're not talking snow cone or shaved ice - Italian ice is made like ice cream except water is substituted for milk. It has a smooth consistency almost like a cross between a sherbet and a sorbet. Scala's offers 13 flavors to choose from and, besides the ever popular lemon, cherry and chocolate (yum!), there are some interesting ones like: peanut butter, cheesecake and mint chocolate chip. Italian ice is scraped rather than scooped and served in paper cups. You can choose virtually as many flavors ans you want to cram into your cup without having to go to a bigger size. And, a small will only set you back $1.80. *Not all flavors are fat free and calorie values vary by flavor but for the most part, we're talking a fat free, low cal treat! (They also have egg creams, though I prefer to stick with Italian ice!)
