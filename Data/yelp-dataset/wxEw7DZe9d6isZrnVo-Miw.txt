5	I love deep tissue massage and the one I had here by Kelli was excellent. Highly recommend!
4	An incredibly small spa. Don't expect to relax here all day long. However, my experience was just what I needed. I frequent spas fairly often and have tried higher end and lower end. I've had all types of services.Ben gave me a truly wonderful and unique massage. He asked what I wanted extra attention on and he made sure to do so while still making sure the rest of my body was well balanced. He asked how I was doing and about pressure about 2 or 3 times which was just enough. When I asked for more pressure he added just the right amount. If you're used to and prefer a typical Swedish massage, Ben may not be the person for you. But, if you're looking to really get worked on I recommend asking for him.They have only one shower in the tiny spa area which can be uncomfortable coming out of it when you're naked and people are coming in. The sauna fits about 3 people comfortably but since there was no one in sight I decided to lay down and use it up for myself. There were 2 vanities with minimal amenities (what could you possibly need when you have your hotel room to go back to after wards?) and 2 bathroom stalls. You get a robe inside your locker along with sandals(I opted to keep my own).Prices were reasonable. I think my 80 minute massage was $121 with tax? They have deals during the week but since I was there for the weekend I couldn't take advantage of them. I'd come back again if I stayed at this hotel again which I hope to because it was a beautiful place to stay!
4	Very friendly spa, very clean, nice ambiance. I had a mani/pedi and it was wonderful! My husband had a massage, not completely satisfied, he said it was just ok.Good service overall.
