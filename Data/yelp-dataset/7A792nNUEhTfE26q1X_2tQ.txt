5	Same bar/same people/different name.The bar is now named "The Anvil".Is there a way to change that here?It could make things confusing.This is my Saturday night spot for great place/great staff/great folks.
3	I've never set foot into the Anvil or even back in its Mason Jar days but; a friend of mine in Tucson has some good memories of the (late) CellBlock down E Indian School.
2	The people here are friendly, in a distract-you-while-they-roofie-your-drink kind of way; so bring a friend :) The lighting is low except in the bathroom where it's blinding. Anvil caters to the leather community, which can be interesting...makes for good people watching. Just don't give off the vibe you're curious (unless you really are). That's likely to get you unwanted attention pretty quick.They have a special on Friday; if you walk around in your underwear drinks are $1 off. Personally, if my clothes are going to be half off the drink better be too.I have friends that like this place (and pay for my drinks), otherwise I wouldn't go.If you're tired of Charlie's or Amsterdam, this could be construed as a change of pace/scene, which can be nice.
4	Friendly staff and non-twink dancers. What more can you ask for?  My vodka tonic, that I drink everywhere I go, tastes awful here for some reason though.
2	Well, I have to say I have never had such terrible service from a bar. There were two other people in there, and I couldn't buy a second second drink because the bartender had other things to do.
