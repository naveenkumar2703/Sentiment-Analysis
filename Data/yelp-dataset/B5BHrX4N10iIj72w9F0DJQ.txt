3	-An overwhelming smell of FEET when you walk in the door.-A little expensive. $12 bucks for a used blouse.-Friendly service.-I think this place caters to the Chico's crowd.-Clean restroom.-Convenient parking.-UGH! The smell of feet and smelly used shoes stayed with me all day.
4	I thought this store was very organized, and had a very nice selection. Cute, clean and friendly service. My only issues were the horrible old-style country music blaring (it sort of ruined the classiness and ambiance)and that you really couldn't tell the fake handbags from the real ones since they were mixed together.  Overall, I really do like this store though.
5	I (and many of my friends) have shopped in this store since it opened.  It is clean, friendly, and most of all great buys.  It is an upscale store, wherein all clothes are cleaned professionally before put on the rack and they are always up-to-date styles. They do carry Chico clothes; however, there is St. John and many other named brands.   Someone wrote that there are no sizes larger than 14; however, most boutique stores carry only to size 14 and this store DOES CARRY SIZE 14!  In fact when I was there last week, I noticed 3 racks of size 14.  Larger size women usually shop at Lane Bryant, etc. and are happier with those stores.  Not only does this store carry the best fashions; their jewelry line is unbelievable, from upscale  high-end to very very good priced costume jewelry.  Also, many giftware items of good prices as well as great shoes and handbags.  My daughter shops there from the East Coast and tells her friends at home that she goes to her favorite boutique in AZ when they compliment her on her clothes/shoes, etc. That is because everything looks and seems NEW!!!
2	I have been there 3 times. No one have ever greeted me or even said Hi . No customer service what so ever. Clothes are designer, but old and out of date. Prices are high. Selection is slim. Needs to put forth a bit more effort in my opinion.
