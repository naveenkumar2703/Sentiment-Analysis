5	So far so good ! Been a patient there for a month now & am finally recovering from low thyroid, panic attacks & other ailments ! Dr Greg is wonderful & really takes his time to understand my various concerns.  They focus on treating physical, emotional & mental conditions.  Im so very happy to be a patient of theirs.
5	ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! No exaggerations.Dr. Greg Olson is a blessing, he's certainly in the right line of work and I'm so fortunate to have stumbled across this clinic.  It's homeopathic, holistic, which means they don't just write you a prescription. They treat you as a person and treat you as a soul, what you put in your mouth, your lifestyle and what's going on in your life.  They dig deeper than just your symptoms. I don't have insurance, so an hour long consultation is $100.  Sooo worth it.Such a blessing. I'm so happy! :)
5	INCREDIBLE...My husband went for health issues, he's off 2 of his meds and walked out of the clinic with more energy than I've seen him have in months.Dr. Greg Olson is a blessing, he's certainly in the right line of work and I'm so fortunate to have had my daughter recommend him.

5	We absolutely love Dr. Royal and highly recommend him.  We travel from SF to visit him and it's always well worth it.Yelp should really have a place to review by category and not just by location...because I'd love to spread the word about Dr. Royal to people in the bay area.
