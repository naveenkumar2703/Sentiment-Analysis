5	Not your average hotel bar. From the outside it might not look very appealing, but once your inside you forget your in a hotel bar. It has a neighborhood bar feel, the prices are great, and although the food is nothing to write home about your allowed to have food delivered or even bring your own! They have poker on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday...you don't have to pay to play, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place win cash and/or gift certificates. If your looking for a neighborhood bar, you found it.
3	As my 3 stars might suggest this is a pretty ok bar. The beer selection isn't that great but it has all the regulars are there.  They do have a good liquor selection.  Food is either microwaved or fried.  But most of the time they don't mind if you have food delivered.  And they do have free popcorn that is pretty good.  It is kind of a diamond in the rough which is nice on Sunday's because you don't have to fight over your game being on the big screen.
5	Great Dive! Friendly staff and free popcorn!
1	You do not want to go to this bar it is full of truck drivers that are just looking for a w**** hopefully you're not one of them they 86 women if they stand up for themselves I rate this bar 1 star:
