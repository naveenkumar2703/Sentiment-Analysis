4	Was craving a torta very badly and the only other place nearby I know that served them was Tortas Paquime, but was never really impressed with that place. So, I decided to give this place a try. El Tri definitely knows how to pack them! I ordered 2 Arizona's to go and a quesadilla with the words. Quesadilla was so large they had to put it in a pizza size box! Tortilla was handmade and warm. Pretty tasty! Tortas were huge, I only ate half of mine, but my husband was able to finish his entirely...although, he dropped into a food coma just seconds after polishing off the whole thing! Will definitely come back and try another one of their sure to be delicious tortas.
5	Dropped in for lunch with skeptical feelings I get with new places I have not tried yet. Came out with plans to eat here when ever I have a craving for Mexican style food. Staff is great food is amazing, even kids loved it and they hate everything.
5	It was the middle of the day and I was on my way to get a burrito from Chipotle when at the corner of my eye I spotted this place close by which looked sad and empty from the outside so I decided to give it a shot instead. In no way do I regret my decision; it's great for a quick delicious Mexican dish or perfect for takeout orders. But what I recommend most and others will testify as well in that "Tortas El Tri" has the best tasting tortas of this side of west Phoenix.
2	Meat Is mediocre, nothing home made about this place, Tortas are small and why put egg in a torta? The tortas are SMALL for 7 dollars average, if you know good mexican food this place is generic food nothing special, it was also dirty I did not like it at all,,, Sorry maybe am too picky but spending 30 dollars on 2 tortas drinks and tip, is not worth it.
