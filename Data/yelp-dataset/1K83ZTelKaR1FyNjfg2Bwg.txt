5	I had so much fun shopping for myself and my granddaughter. Name brand jeans, tops, leggings, scarves & jewelry as well as many other items, Men's, boys and kids clothing. Some new and the rest gently worn. I bought about $400 worth of name brand items that looked like new for $98. I haven't been this excited about a store in a very long time! I highly recommend this store and the staff is very helpful and fun too!
5	Just recently went into this store-the name had me a little worried that I would be walking into some high end boutique that I could never afford and I was pleasantly surprised when I found out it was a thrift store! This is a great addition to the shopping center. The layout is clean and fresh, it doesn't smell like a used clothing store at all (it's very clean) and the owner is pleasant and happy to chat or let you wander the racks. There is a ton of clothes for men and women and even some kids clothes, all at can't beat prices. I didn't see any damaged clothes, these are very gently used. There are deals all the time and I will be coming back here often to see what new stock has been added. About time Vegas got a store like this, it's well worth stopping in to see what they have!
5	Love this little hidden treasure of a store.  They have some very cute items starting for shoes, clothes, purses to little nick knacks.  They have clothes for women,, children and men.  I found three bar stool chairs for $35.00 each all in great shape. Wow what a bargain. I was so happy. I made those chair fit into my little toyota corolla with the help of the staff and some nice ladies.  Great place to find surprising bargains.  Check them out if you like to find deals that are gently used.happy shopping your fellow yelpie terri xoxoxox
1	Their website says they had to close their doors. I hate to see local businesses fail.
