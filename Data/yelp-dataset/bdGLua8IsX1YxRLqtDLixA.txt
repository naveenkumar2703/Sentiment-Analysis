4	Awesome Carne Asada tacos!! Really tasty. Nice charbroiled steak and fast and friendly service. Can't go wrong. Can't wait to try more.
4	Tried the carne asada Torta today and it was pretty good. Good place if you're looking for a true inexpensive Mexican food restaurant in El Mirage. Very clean with friendly staff.
3	Very clean restaurant not far from Surprise Ball field.  Horchata was too sweet, carne asada was pretty bland but it was high quality meat.  The chile relleno was quite impressive!  The chicken sope was decent but the masa was a little too firm to cut through without a knife.  Got our food very quickly.  Disappointed there weren't chips and salsa...I felt like I got half a Mexican dinner.  :). This was average Mexican taqueria to me...but I'm spoiled in California.
5	Love them. Better than filibertos. Also love their homemade lemonade.Their carne asada burrito is one of the better ones I've ever had. The meat isn't dry like other places.
4	Good carne Asada in El Mirage? I guess it is possible because Humberto's delivered in a good way during a recent visit in this outpost of a town. There was not one piece of grizzle or fat in the entire two tacos, which already is a good start. I do like my carne a bit thinner, but this version, despite needing some extra chewing, was still quite tasty. The tacos were loaded to the brim with meat and just a dusting of guacamole and a splash of pico. They gave you red and green sauce on the side, both of which were on the mild side. Only other small issue is that they need to double-wrap the tacos because we had a taco malfunction halfway through numero uno. Regardless, at $2.80 per taco, these puppies aren't worth a special trip here, but if your in the area, you will be happy with your order.
2	Ok. So.... Being a Latina and living in AZ all my life, I know some good Mexican food when I see it/eat it. This place USED to taste good a few years ago, Well not so much of good food this time from My husband and I's experience. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito wet, aka enchilada style. First off, I don't think the cashier understood too well, however, she was polite and seemed like she did, anyway, didn't get it wet when my order was served,  but they fixed it at "no charge". Long story short, my beans didn't have any flavor and didn't taste "fresh", the enchilada sauce tasted as if it was from a can, my husbands fish tacos were soggy, no flavor, and chewy (batter). The red and green Chili/salsa was good though...I had to pour it on my food to give it flavor. Overall I felt it was a waste of money. Very disappointed :-(
4	Awesome California Burritos!!!!   Best local place for a burrito
3	Such good food and such a nice cook and cashier (depending on who you get), it's too bad that it's smack dab in the middle of one of the most ghetto cities in all of Arizona. El Mirage is responsible for housing some of the dirtiest crudest people I've ever had the displeasure of coming across. On a side note, $7 for an egg, potato and cheese burrito?!!!! That is just ridiculous!
