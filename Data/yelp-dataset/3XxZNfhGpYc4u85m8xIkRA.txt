1	Went to this location for 2 yrs for oil changes and occasional miscellaneous repairs with no problem.  Once I got a 'new" used car, I went in for oil change and for them to look it over and came away with a 4 page repair list!!!  I have never gone back there.  I have gone back to dealer as well as a Midas location to verify the things on the list, they did find 2 things wrong, neither was on Firestones 4 pages of repairs and everything that was in the 5 pages was total BS.....I have never gone back!
1	Brought my truck in for a second opinion on my auto a/c.  The first place I brought it to told me that I had cool components under the hood but none of it was getting into the cab.  I brought it to Firestone for a second opinion,  they said I needed to fix the entire a/c unit.  Brought it back to the first shop I went to and they said my a/c was no longer running cool under the hood.  I'm not an expert detective, but I suspect that my freon was drained at Firestone so they could add the extra service on.
5	I have had many issues with one of my cars--my "clunker" and wouldn't trust any one but Firestone to fix the issues. I prefer this location because the work done is not only incredible, but the quality of customer service here is above and beyond all of my expectations. I am always treated with kindness and respect, I really appreciate all of their hard work! If you want good service and if you want to be treated with respect, I highly recommend you go to this Firestone!
