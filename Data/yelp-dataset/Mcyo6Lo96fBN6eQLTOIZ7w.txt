5	Great boxing place for adults and kids.  Big Cat offers classes from beginners to advanced athletes and has a great mix of boxing, suspension training and more.   Instructor is respectable and very helpful.  Recommend this facility to all my friends and family.
5	I highly recommend big cat boxing!  It is great for any level of fitness.  Love the one on one boxing classes and LOVE the 14 day alien training.  Having done two sessions of 14 day training it has helped my soccer game and overall fitness.  Big cat is truly there for his clients and helps us reach our fitness goals!!!  I WILL BE BACK SOON!
5	I LOVE Big Cat Boxing!!! I needed something motivating to get me back in shape, and I look and feel better than ever. The 14-day Alien workout is the answer to a leaner and more toned figure fast. I've done many fitness programs and have never achieved such quick results. The perks of going to Big Cat Boxing is the attention pertaining to your individual fitness goals. The small group atmosphere allows for more personal fitness instruction targeting individual needs from Big Cat himself. He truly cares about making people feel better about themselves. I highly recommend this program/facility if your are up for a challenge and ready for a positive change.
5	I have done many fitness programs in my day. Lots of big promises, and very little result. I walked into Big Cat with a Living Social voucher 7 days ago and haven't missed a day since. The workouts are fun and very, very, challenging. It's a great atmosphere. I'm pretty sore, but I'm working towards being in the best shape of my life, so it's totally worth it.
