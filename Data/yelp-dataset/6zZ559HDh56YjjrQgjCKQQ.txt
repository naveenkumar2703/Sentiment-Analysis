1	I have been here twice and both times were horrible. My husband went there once because his GPS said it was closer to the house than the one off of Craig and Scott Robinson (which is head over heels better). He said he could barely eat it but he did because he was hungry. Don't go! You'll save money and your taste buds from a bad meal.
4	This Panda Express has a drive throw. They are fast and friendly I will be coming back.
