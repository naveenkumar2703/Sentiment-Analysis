1	Got off to a bad start with Cubs Park.  Had tickets for the game Mar 1.  It's just over an hour drive for us and after traveling almost there we found the game was cancelled because they didn't tarp the field.  The rain had passed but ...sigh...no game.  They told us we could trade the tickets for another game.....but only in person (not on line or on the phone).  Ticket office said to present them an hour before game time to exchange them.  We called on Fri, Mar 14 and asked about attending the game on Mon, Mar 17 and she said it shouldn't be a problem.  Drove the hour+, paid to park and then were turned away.  There has to be some way to do this with driving all the way there. I find this practice completely archaic in todays age of technology.  Exchanging 5 lawn seats should involve so many round trips without even being admitted!!!!!!
5	When traveling, purchase tickets however you can.  Online or by phone.  Granted the process is a little daunting for the Cubs.  Weird might be a better word.  That being said.  Good thing I purchased the tickets early.  The game was sold out.  Got a voice confirmation, followed up to confirm again, got a confirmation number, saved it and presented it to the cheery girl behind the window the day of the game.No problem.
