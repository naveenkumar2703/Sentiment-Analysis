4	So last week we get a flyer for this place, it was actually put inside of our Lilac planter by our front door.  We decided to give this place a try.  We got a pizza (veggie with no tomatoes), a side salad, two liter of Diet Pepsi, and two large cookies for $20.  That was with delievery.  The pizza was very good.  The dough was just right, not to thick or thin.  When it arrived it smelled wonderful.  It was very good.  I am a person who does not like a lot of sauce on her pizza, so when a place does not totally cover the dough with five ladels of sauce I am happy.  I even usually say light sauce.  We did not tell this place that, and the amount of sauce was perfect.  So I would order from this place agian.
1	Like the other poster we received a flyer stating if it isn't the best they will refund the money. So we tried it. Got the pie and it wasn't cooked. I called them and informed them of the situation. The individual said he would refund the money. I said no need just give us another pizza next time we call. He said that was great and gave me his name. Win- Win both I thought. A few weeks later I called the same number and informed the person of the deal and she would have to talk to someone about it. She said she would call back which she did- there was no person by the name I was given. I asked for a manager and she gave me the number to call to talk to some one- which I did and was told the managers were gone until the next morning. So I called another number asked for a manager. He came on the phone and I explained the situation- he said there was no person by that name. by this time I was so irritated that it took 4 phone calls over a $20 items. He said he would give another pizza, but I didn't want to go thru the hassle again and declined. So if your pie is bad and want a refund ,. . . . . expect a interrogation and lots of inconvenience in getting.
