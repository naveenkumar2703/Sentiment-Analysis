2	2 stars just because the sandwich was good and the guy who took our order was friendly. Other than that, this was a very bad first experience at this KFC. We ordered 2 grilled chicken sandwiches and got original fried instead. As we went back to let them know, the girl (who was also the manager) gave us a very bad sour attitude and didn't even apologize for the mix up. Then she came back with the new order and again we even thanked her and she just gave us a look and didn't say anything. Also, she took the old order and sold it to the next person at the drive thru.The same order that we had opened up and touched a second ago!!!
1	I don't normally make reviews for fast food chains such as KFC unless it's exceptionally good or bad. And this one is the latter. The family bucket meal I bought here besides the sides seemed like it was at least 8 hours old. It was stale and the breading on the original recipe wasn't good at all.This is probably the worst KFC I've been too. Just avoid this place, and KFC doesn't seem to do quality control at this location.
1	I wish I could do no stars. My husband and I went twice to this place and it was terrible. Both times the order was incorrect, it was like a fight just to get it corrected. They tried to double and triple charge us. They had a horrible attitude. The chicken was so tough it was like jerky. The green beans were horribly bland and the mash potatoes were a nightmare. We will never be visiting KFC again in Vegas. I'll wait till I am traveling elsewhere.
