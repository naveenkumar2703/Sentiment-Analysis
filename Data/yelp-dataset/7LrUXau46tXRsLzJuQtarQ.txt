4	They offer good pizza and cheese sticks (their dipping sauce is incredible!).  The have buy one get one free any size pizza on Monday and Tuesday nights after 5 pm.  The also offer a $7.99 one topping large pizza for carry-out any time.  A good value and good food.  I will say the service can be very spotty.  If they weren't so close to home I would keep searching for better service.
4	I agree with John.  The pizza is good if it is fresh.  The service can be good or not so good.  In the beginning it was not so good.  They also have had a few problems with their credit card machine.  It seems like the kinks are all worked out though.I really like their dipping sauce- very garlicy.  Their pizza is a lot like Papa John's crust- not too thick, not too thin.
2	I decided to try this place since it's so close to my house.  I ordered over the phone and then went to pick up the pizza at the store.  The girl on the phone who took my order was a total idiot.  She spoke so softly that I couldn't hear a word she said.  She asked me the same question several times.  When I asked her questions, she didn't answer them.  When I arrived at the store to pick up the pizza, I was not greeted.  Both registers were attended by employees who just looked at me blank faced.  Needles to say, the service was HORRIBLE!  The pizza was okay.  The garlic bread was terrible, but the dipping sauce, a marinara-type sauce, was good.
1	CLOSED.....These guys lasted about two months...they're gone now, replaced by Zza's Pizza...will review it once I've tried it. But I gotta say, it's a funky location, and location's everything.
