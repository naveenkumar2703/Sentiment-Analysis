5	79 cent Thirst Buster is the best thing in the world.
1	Theresa was in direct violation of the ADA act. Some people need to read up on it before discriminating against veterans with service dogs
4	Any Circle K with a public bathroom gets a 4 star in my book....so many times I have gone to places that don't have public bathrooms that I am going to start giving those jerks 1-2 stars.  This place is old and run down but it serves its purpose....fuel, convenient store, and most of all PUBLIC BATHROOMS!
1	Gas is always higher here than the store directly accross the street and the auto shut off malfunctioned on me today using pump #4 and proceeded to get gas all over my car, the ground.
