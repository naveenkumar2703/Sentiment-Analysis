5	I don't normally review corner markets, but I have to here. They have build your own 6 packs of craft beer for 8.99! They also have their own growlers of rotating craft beer which you can refill and buy the growler bottle there . Great selection of cigars and cigar boxes as well.  Love the back corner which has some nice to tobacco pipes.  Every ting is iry! :) If you need some good beer go to cactus and the dude behind the corner is awesome! Such a great guy who is super nice.
5	You would never know it unless someone told you, so I'm going to. You can get growlers of a lot of good, local beer in here. They have Papago's orange blossom, a lot of the four peaks beers, etc. They are different every week I think so there's a good variety. Cheap, too.
5	My boyfriend and I used to live across the street from this place. There's a circle K right by us too, but we would ALWAYS go here. The owner is so friendly and remembers us every time. Super awesome beer selection and a build your own 6-pack for super cheap. Good prices, friendly staff and super convenient!
5	Hands-down, this is my favorite place to fill my growler! They have great craft beer options that they rotate consistently, and they will even take your requests if you have one. The guys who work here are awesome, and always bring a smile to my face. As of this date, you get $2 off when you fill your growler on Mondays or Tuesdays! Also, as other people have mentioned, you can build your own 6-pack for $8.99 and they have a great selection of beers. I highly recommend!
