2	This is a fairly large place, & nice inside.  It had a couple of TVs playing, but not too loudly, as a moderate crowd joined me for dining on about 55 trays of food at lunchtime.  The hot & sour soup was neither, & while some of the hot food items were good, a lot of it was too oily for my taste.  There were several shrimp dishes, which was nice, & the service was friendly & attentive, but the price was a little high at $7.45 for lunch.Crown China Super Buffet down the street is a better choice.
3	Popped in on a Wednesday afternoon. There was a good variety of Chinese dishes and a large number of seafood dishes (multiple shrimp dishes, fish, squid, fake lobster dish) was surprised to see pizza and kielbasa on the choices as well. The banner says Lunch is $5.99 on the outside, for the buffet so I decided to try it. I have had better buffets and better Chinese food but it was OK. The price I later learned does not include your drink, which I think in all fairness it should. They have a few deserts and soft serve ice cream but I passed on the sweets. My favorite was the fried butterfly shrimp, they were tender, meaty and tasty - had 5 of them. The chow mien was a little greasy but still tasty. Sampled some chicken dish that was also tasty but since nothing is labeled to tell you what it is called it's hard to know. Also thought the take out food situation was weird, they give you a Styrofoam clam shell thing, you fill it yourself with whatever and then you pay something like $3.65 a pound for your order. WTF, is with that? I'll pass on that. The staff is attentive. The place from what I saw was was clean. There were a few TVs in the place to watch, but one was a little to loud over the others but not to annoying. It's an okay buffet, but I have been to better and not paid much more, for better quality and bigger variety with the drink included. Doubt if I'll return with so many Chinese buffets to still choose from.
