4	I love to eat. And I shop hungry. I know, bad for me... good for Albertsons.
4	I was actually trying to locate the corner store for albertsons and it isnt on Yelp.  I will add it.  This is where I go to get my morning "fuel".  (Although if you ask me I gave up caffeine).  I sometimes need a 32 oz soda to get me going in the morning.... :)  The customer service at this location is outstanding!  Every employee is really nice and friendly, they greet you when you walk in the door and they through a penny your way if you a short a cent or two!  My lack of a full 5 stars is because this place needs a little updating. When I go to some of the other "soda stations" nearby they have those cool machines with a choice of lids and a shot of this or that. You can grab a lid from the - I don't have to touch every lid to get my lid- holder, and it just seems cleaner because its newer.  Its close to home so I keep going, but I would be pretty psyched if they updated a bit!
1	Crabby cashier...Evelyn..?...Didn't greet me. Didn't speak to me through my entire transaction. Heck, she didn't even tell me the total!! Hello??? When there are 4 grocery stores equal distance from my house, you really should be nice or at the very least, talk to your customers!!
2	I am not sure how albertsons stays in business. It is the closest grocery store to my house but i will drive further to go somewhere else. I have 2 reasons for this:1. The overall prices are not competitive with frys. On occasions when i don't feel like driving & i shop albertsons my bill is always higher.2. In the 10 years i have lived in the area & have stopped in albertson because i just had to pick up a few things- the wait to check out is consistently long. It seems like they need more cashiers.
