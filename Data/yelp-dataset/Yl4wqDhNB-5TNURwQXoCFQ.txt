5	I'm a travel nurse who's only in Phoenix for a short time and this place is near my apartment, which is the only reason I decided to walk in there. I was craving Mexican for lunch, but when I walked in I almost walked right back out because the atmosphere is not a good first impression. The place looks outdated and worn out, stained ceiling tiles, stuffy, and was almost empty.  My young son was with me and he wanted to stay, so we tried it.  BEST burrito ever.  The food was very fresh and tasty. Don't be put off by the looks of this place, they are for real.  I wish they had the money to remodel so more people would be attracted to them, the food is amazing. Maybe we can get Robert Irvine and Restaurant Impossible in there? LOL
1	Where should I start?  The ridiculous colors they chose the halfway paint the building?  Maybe that they can't decide if they are a restaurant (as stated on their liquor license) or a night club as stated on Christian Nava Cruz's FaceBook.http://www.azliquor.gov/query/results_licenseNumber.cfm?licensenumber=12079226https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/66999_4244597152749_1112729945_n.jpg

1	Update.  This 'restaraunt' was closed because they were actually trying to run a nightclub.   Happy about the closure.  It only brought garbage into the hood.
