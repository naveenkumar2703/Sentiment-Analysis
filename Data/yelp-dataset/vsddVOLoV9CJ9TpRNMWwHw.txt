5	If you love all things furry, cutesy, quirky, creepy and fun this is definitely THE place.I really wanna live in here and fulfill all of my childhood Candyland fantasies: Rendevous with a kooky rock man, be-friend the two-headed baby doll dragon, and eat multiple pieces of the multi-tiered pastel cakes and glittery mushrooms!This is one of the most unique stores Phoenix has to offer, and of course it has the BEST location- right next to Bikini Lounge! Another beautiful/fantastic thing is that Beatrice Moore the "Grand Dame" is the owner/shopkeeper crafter of the joint! pom poms and pipe cleaners galore, you will definitely find a one of a kind super kooky kraft to cherish here or if you are in the market one of Moore's amazing paintings.If you don't like this place, a big BOO to you. You're probably no fun, like, at all.
5	If Salvador Dali's medium was furry pipe cleaners and plaster wedding cakes he'd live here.  There's a lot being said beautifully and creatively by these seven creative crafters.  You'll have to visit and see what the work says to you.
4	A cirque de handmade, Phoenix's best late night source (till 11 pm on weekends!) for vintage, retro craft supplies that you simply can't find anywhere else.  Owner Beatrice is knowledgable about handmade traditions and has filled her shop with inspiration.  She is generous with ideas and advice on projects you may have in mind.  Well worth a browse, and if they happen to be closed never fear, you can fill your eyeballs with fascinating sights just by looking through the ample glass windows or venture over to etsy.com to shop online at the Kooky Krafts store there.
