5	SportClips Haircuts: Guys watch sports! Guys get haircuts!What a an experience!  SportClips offers inexpensive men's haircuts with options!  Just $16 for a men's haircut and wash AFTER (great so you don't have little hairs everywhere for the rest of the day).  You also have the option of doing a shoulder massage - heaven!  Meanwhile, you are in a cool place with sports decor everywhere, and TVs playing the sports you like.  The employees definitely know sports, and in my case, Deana was nice, friendly, and gave me the perfect cut.This place reminds me of the old-style barbers of the 1940s & 50s, who cut your hair while you and the other guys talk about guy things - like sports!  In this day and age, there are plenty of salons for women.  Why do guys need to sit there and get their haircut in an atmosphere they feel uncomfortable in?  This is a modern-style, friendly, sporty place with great services and low prices!  Three Madison locations: Corner of PD & Verona Rd, Deming Way in Middleton, and Gammon Rd near Woodman's.  I'll definitely be coming back (after all, I got a coupon for $5 off my next haircut, $4 off the following one, and so on, down to $2, which I believe all new clients get)!
1	My son wanted a flat top no one didn't knew how to do it. With being a guy place for haircuts, I would think they could a flat top. I will not be back. Very disappointed.
4	I have been taking my son here for a while now. He is a teen and seems to like it better than normal salons. We always get in and out quick.
3	The hair cutters I've had did a good job, can't complain.  I'm not too picky about my haircut like some people. I don't enjoy the atmosphere.  It's a bunch of men and 5-6 young women with sportscenter playing.  It's hard to carry on a conversation with the hair cutters. Stadium Barbers by Camp Randall is a real barber shop.  I used to go there when I lived downtown, but now I go here for the proximity.
