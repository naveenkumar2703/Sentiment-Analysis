5	Beautiful ambiance & seating. Same great coffee.
3	Average Starbucks. Slow drive-thru and needed me to repeat my order three times.
5	Can't live without coffee from Starbucks .. Long lines but service is fast
1	Watch how they ring you up - they rang me up for a black tea lemonade when I ordered just black tea. The clerk claimed it was because I asked for a splash of flavoring (not even a pump of syrup). 2 drinks + small food items was $20. Bad service and rude employee.The employee who made my drink did add the flavoring for me which was nice. Aria - these employees need to be trained up to meet your service levels that I have learned to expect.
1	Excuse me, why is my grande green tea frappe that I usually get for $4.45, over $7 here? Oh cause we're in Aria. What?! This urked me so bad but they already made it since it took forever to charge my account! Go to the one right outside of here. Ridiculous.
