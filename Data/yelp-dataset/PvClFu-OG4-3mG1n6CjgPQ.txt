5	Based on a previous yelpers recommendation of the meatball sub. It's only a block anyway from me and I've never been there until today. 10 years. Shame on me. I'll admit that I almost did an about face when I walked in as it's basically a guy in his basement with a pizza oven and a small commercial refer. Still, Darren's review piqued my interest. mr demino told me he could make me anything I wanted but I still opted for the meatball sub. He told me 20 minutes and I ran some errands. Came back and plopped down my $7 and I had just liberated what, unknown to me at the time, was about to be a landmark food experience. I busted the behemoth from it's foil and paper prison and was shocked, first, by the aroma. Wow. Just wow. My mouth instantly began to water. Second, the size. This thing felt like I was carrying a body home but I just wasn't ready for what was about to be unleashed.I'll start with my second bite because I think I passed out on the first one. Heaven. I have been thinking all night about a better meatball sub that I've had in my life. I haven't. This was an unbelievable sandwich. The tenderness of the meat. The savoriness of it. The seasoning all worked together. I am not a fan of sauce and this sauce was excellent. Out of this world. Really. The cheese was perfectly layered all throughout and just tasted as fresh as the Italian bread which was so soft and smelled so good. Perfectly toasted.There was so much of it and I probably could've really only eaten half of it. But I eated it all. I don't think I've ever emotionally missed a sandwich or food in such a short time span before but now I have. It's going to be hard to limit myself to only one every week or two. Very difficult.
3	After reading Darren W.'s review, I was so excited to try a pie from DeMino's, but when I went called the place tonight (and drove past it a bit later), the phone was disconnected and the venue was for rent. :(Permanently closed, it would seem!
