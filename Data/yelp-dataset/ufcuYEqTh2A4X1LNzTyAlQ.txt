5	If you are a fan, you will love this place. It's so cheesy you will explode with glee. While I was there, I was looking around the museum and this blond lady is standing at a table with photos from Kissing Cousins and says "that's me with Elvis." Bizarre! It's what I go to Vegas for. Of course if you're looking to be cosmopolitan and completely chic--avoid this place! It will debunk your high social status. Moving on. The impersonator show is awesome. Our guy was really into it. Donnie Williams was his name. I may have messed up his last name, but it was worth seeing. The little lounge they perform in is very cool and red.

5	What a great memory! Since my Dad was a huge Elvis fan and I grew up on his music, I felt obliged to visit!  The museum itself was okay, and the shop offered some great gift a for an Elvis fan, but the absolute best part was the live show! We heard that we got the "good" impersonator, but man, he was excellent!  I felt like a teenage girl in the front row! I *think* his name was Donnie.  The show offered service to and from the museum,  which was great in traffic!
