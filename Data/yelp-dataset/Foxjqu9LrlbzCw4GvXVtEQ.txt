4	When I go to a bank, I expect:+ Fast Service+ Friendly PeopleThis particular branch had both when I recently cashed a check here.  It was also conveniently located across the street from the Desert Ridge shopping area.  Not much more I could ask for.Return Factor - 75%
5	Really like this branch. Very friendly and professional staff.
5	In the age of credit cards, debit cards, online and mobile banking, I don't find myself going much further than the ATM when it comes to going to the bank.  However;  Once in a great while I do find myself needing to go inside the bank to use a service, or see a teller, and this branch actually makes me miss those good old days of human interaction.The employees are really friendly.  The kind of friendly where in the couple of minutes it took to withdraw money into a cashier's check, I think the teller and manager knew my whole life story.  I'm not really a conversationalist when it comes strangers, but they always manage to break me out of shell.
5	Went through the drive through today for the first time, fast service. Could have been a little bit faster since there was only 1 guy working. Would go back if I ever needed a bank close to me to use.
