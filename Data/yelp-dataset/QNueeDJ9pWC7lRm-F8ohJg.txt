3	West Marine is a last resort for parts you need that nobody else has.  Prices are insanely high, although they *will* price match Amazon and some other online retailers.  Stock varies, with some items always available and some key items seemingly always out of stock.  My last two trips there I've been unable to get very basic necessities.  You're far better off ordering online if you can wait, or going to MarineMax down the street.
3	All you boaters out there should know that if an item is marked "marine", that is going to be expensive - If it is marked "sailboat", then it is REALLY going to be expensive!  With this in mind, it should be no surprise that many of the items sold and marketed by West Marine are pricey.  Some of the items they stock are unnecessarialy pricey, however, so I can only give them 3/5 stars.The staff here is nice - The one girl who works there is cute, so that is a "thumbs-up" in my book as well ;-)Happy Boating!
1	Been going here for specialty boat items for 10 years spanning ownership of 4 boats. Ordered something from a VERY helpful gentlemen last Saturday. I got a message the part had arrrived in precisely the time I was told... I show up to an empty store with 2 employees attending to a pallet of product. One asks me if I need help and I explain I'm there to pick up a special order part... He says "OK." and proceeds to put his hands in his pockets and talk to the girl attending to the pallet. 2 min later the girl begins walking towards us and asks my last name... She doesn't here me apparently and borderline yells "WHAT?" at me. After repeating, she gets the part, tosses it on the counter, charges me and says, "Thanks" in a smart tone while walking away. Marine Max 1 mile away just got all of my business. You're welcome for a decade worth of business. Too bad you tossed it on a $3.16 part.
