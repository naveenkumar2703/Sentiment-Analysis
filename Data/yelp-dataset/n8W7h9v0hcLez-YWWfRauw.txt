5	So glad there is a independent Volkswagen shop. I have never been happy paying dealership prices and now that I found VeeDub AutoWerks I never will pay dealership prices again. Not only were they cheaper then the dealership but the office guy was so friendly and took the time to explain what my car needed without the added pressure to fix everyone at one time. Thank you for VeeDub you have a customer for life!
5	I brought my son's 2006 Jetta in and I expected to spend close to the $1,200 quoted to me by a dealer for a major repair. VeeDub Autowerks determined that the dealer had misdiagnosed the problem and was able to fix the issue at less than 1/2 of the cost the dealer quoted me. They also gave me a prioritized list of repairs and maintenance needed over the next year rather than try to upsell me on completing all the unnecessary work on the first visit. I will be back and highly recommend the very friendly, honest guys at VeeDub Autowerks.
5	We have a 2000 VW Jetta that has been towed so often we joke that it likes the AAA drivers better than us.  One of the tow drivers recommended VeeDub & we called them.  It takes a lot to impress me, my father was a top notch mechanic, so I expect a lot.  I have never been more pleased with the price, the work, and the knowledge of the staff.  Not only is our car running great, they priced out some future work we wanted to do & when I called back a couple days later, I told them my name & they answered "the 2000 Jetta!". They really know their VW's, I recommend them to any VW owner.
5	Awesome VW mechanics. I just found this place as I drove by the other day and never knew it existed. They are honest, fair, and know VW's. I won't take my VW anywhere else now. All the other reviews I've seen on other sites seem to agree too.
5	I've been here twice and both visits have been absolutely awesome. The staff is very welcoming and they always complete their tasks very quickly! I couldn't recommend this place enough.
