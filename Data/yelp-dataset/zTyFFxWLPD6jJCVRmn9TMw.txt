4	I cannot believe there is only 1 other review of this place. Chicken & Waffles people come on.I was looking for something different last Sunday morning and I remembered seeing this place on MLK.I would agree with the other reviewer about the parking, small awkward and hard to get in & out.It's a small diner with a booth along the entire front wall and several tables. A sign reading "seat yourself" greets you the moment you walk in.The place is small but cozy with a TV in the center so every seat in the house can see it,There is was only 2 servers and a large table there when I arrived so it took a few minutes to get drinks&menus.The menus said stright up "Just Chicken & Waffles"-and thats exactly what it was 2pc-3pc-dark,white,wheat,buttermilk,wha do you want.In small print across the bottom it read "Friday-Sunday BBQ Ribs $10"I asked and she said"nope,chicken & waffles"Well I got 2 breast,2 waffles and my son got the special 3 wings & a waffle.The food came out real fast with hot syrup on the side and we doused our chicken in some hot sauce & tore it up.Why have I never had this before, I bet I never even took a breath.Some of the best chicken I have had. Not all deep fried & greasy or steroided out just sweet crispy & very savory.And the waffles were good too. what a mix.This is a true dive spot DIAMOND!

The waffles take up the majority of your plate and they are warm, soft, and have a great cinnamon taste to them.  And the chicken....WOW.  Light crisp breading on the chicken that's not too greasy.
4	the service was fast, The guy seem was a little upset (don't know why) he just was not friendly. I had the chicken n waffles.......Waffles were great the chicken tasted like it was old and fries too hard. My friend had the fried catfish mmmmm gooood...... I ate half of her's. Everything else was good. I would go again, but wont get the chicken
