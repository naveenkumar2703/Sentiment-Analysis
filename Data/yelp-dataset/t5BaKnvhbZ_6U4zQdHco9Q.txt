4	The Cupboard, although not really a shop specifically targeted towards my age range (20s) does what it does very well, and is clearly highly rated and frequented by regulars. I felt going in and judging the shop from my sometimes random fashion point of view would be unfair reviewing, so I took in a willing volunteer, my mother, who is a more than occasional shopper, plus around the right audience/type of style for this kind of boutique.For a start, if I do say so myself concerning family traits, my mum is in no way a frumpy mother, dresses really well, and likes a good bit of fashion, although "no mutton dressed as lamb" outfits -  one of her all time favourite phrases. As soon as she entered The Cupboard, she gleefully snatched an Italian designer coat from the rails, and was swirling about it in it instantly, while simultaneously surveying a pair of diamante encrusted glasses on display. I definitely understand where The Cupboard naming comes from, because there are a lot of unique pieces to rifle through in different styles and from by designers...I suppose kind of like looking into someone's cupboard, although it would have to be someone with the purse strings for designer items, because as with most designer boutiques, prices here are at the higher end, but that's because the clothes are high-end. My mum fully approved of the attire on offer, plus the shop owner was super friendly and great banter, which always makes you more inclined to return.
4	Like Cheryl, I'm not really the intended target audience for The Cupboard but it certainly didn't stop me going in for a browse and the exterior was so fresh and swish that it made it very inviting. The interior is just as nice, very organised and all the clothes are on rails making it easy to browse through the glamorous wares. They have a good range of designer clothing from everyday wear to more dressy pieces. Prices are as you would expect from a designer shop and the clothes are very good quality and so unusual that you can feel safe in the knowledge that you are going to have something a little bit different to everything else on the high street.
