1	I ordered a fountain pump from these thieves, and they charged my credit card and never sent me the pump. Further, they then refused to respond to any emails, and I am still trying to get my money back. Do not do business with these people.
4	I have gone to their store and found that they were extremely helpful. I explained what type of pump I need and the weird connection. They mad it work. I always them!
1	They are very unreliable and disorganizedThey will sell you a part at retail, then charge you to come out to replace it under warranty, but charge for their labor.  Even when they make a faulty installation!  That was dishonest in my opinion.  And, they wouldn't return the install fee even though it was botched!Also, even if you have a warranty problem, they will take weeks to come to your house or business for a quick fix.  Generally its twice: once to look, second to repair, generating a 6 week process(you have to get back in line again).they keep bankers hours; no Saturdays, and close early.They have received other bad reviews because it was complained that they are untrustworthy and unreliable.They did an estimate on a big job that would not have solved the problem(thank the stars for a great concrete company), it only would have been a major expense straight down the drain.. They recommended a new fountain and after taking out the old.  What was needed was a revamp of the concrete and keep the fountain.Heather in there front office is tough, unaccommodating, and surly.   Other personnel seem to not to  be with it.They are horrible about returning messages of any kind.  Don't be fooled.  there are other people who can work on your fountain.
