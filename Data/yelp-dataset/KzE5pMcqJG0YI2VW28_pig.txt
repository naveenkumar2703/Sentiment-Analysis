5	Great food, nice "casual but upscale" atmosphere, and (generally) wonderful wait staff.  The bar's a great place for a nicer-than-usual happy hour too although on Friday and Saturday nights, you often have to defend your seat/table with an iron fist as once all the chairs are taken, there's not very many good places to stand...  They sell Banfi sparkling red wine by the glass and it's deliciously festive!
3	Nice location, decent drinks.  With all of the "upscaling" going on in Madison right now, this place could definitely use an interior redesign.  Nothing is beat up, but the style is about 20 years out of date.  Drove by for many years and thought it was very nice, finally went in and was underwhelmed by the decor, but impressed by the service and friendly barkeep.  Has a lot of potential with a redesign.
4	I think any place that is non pretentious but has white table cloths and candles, and has a drink called Green Fish,  and another one called Red Fish, and another one called Blue fish, and another one called.. well... you get the point, is OK by me.Seriously THE BEST service.  The servers are COMPLETELY attentive, reminding you that this is a locally owned restaurant, and they prefer to use locally owned/produced consumables, but there was NOT ONE MOMENT that the servers were not agreeable, funny, and made sure that we were enjoying our dining experience.The hummus platter was the only thing that was meh.  But their pasta (Pasta Park Avenue) YUM!.  Artichoke mushroom crostinis were DELIGHTFUL.  And their pub chips.. DIVINE.Also, their tiramisu is heaven.  Except it is large enough to feed a small country, so be prepared to share or sign up for gastric bypass right away...Loved it.  LOVED it many times!!!
5	Grade: A-Excellent service. Fantastic drinks. Great food.
