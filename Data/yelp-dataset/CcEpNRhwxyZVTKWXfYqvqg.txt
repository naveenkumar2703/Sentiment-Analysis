4	Fortunately enough to swing by for a soft opening! Great place to grab a snack before or after a movie at MAC. Sampled the chocolate chip waffle bites sprinkled with powdered sugar and a side of syrup.Can't wait to try the waffles wrapped hot dogs.Thanks to a buddy posting the opening on fb ...I just happen to be in the area.
2	The food wasn't "bad,", but it wasn't great either. The service was terrible. For that reason alone, we won't be back.
5	Very cool and different place! Waffles and hot dogs or both. I'm not really a hot dog fan but the waffles are amazing! They have a cinnamon flavor to them and you can put any toppings you want on/in it. My favorite is peanut butter and honey. Great price and quick service. Definitely will be going back!
5	This place is so cool! How some waffle poppers and took a journey around what they had to offer. Very cool :)
