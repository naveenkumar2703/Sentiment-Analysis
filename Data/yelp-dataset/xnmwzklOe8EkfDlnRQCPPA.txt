5	Jennifer, of Jehnuine Designs, does great work and is very professional. About a year ago she created a logo for my business. She created exactly what I envisioned and turned around the project quickly. I would go back to Jehnuine Designs for other design projects and recommend her to friends, as well.
5	I just recommended Jehnuine Designs, once again, to a friend who needed some website, social media, and general marketing work for her small business. I was just shown the finished product and, of course, she does not disappoint!
5	We used Jehnuine Designs to build an e-commerce site for our electronics company. She did a great job designing the layout and her artistic visions made the site spectacular.Thanks Jehn for all your help!
5	I used Jehnuine Designs for my branding and website needs. As a new small business owner, I had to find someone who saw my vision. I was given the advice from a friend to use this up and coming designer and I am so glad I did. My logo and blog are designed just to my liking. Her prices were competitive and she went above and beyond to see the project through. I even texted her a picture of what was in my head! That dedication and commitment is hard to come by and I felt like family. Jehn is an awesome person and an awesome designer. See what she did for me at www.mishapsandmesses.com
5	We came to Jehn, at Jehnuine Designs to help design and build our website.  We are a new company and believe our branding and website are going to be extremely important to our success.  Jehn was very responsive and helpful over the several weeks prior to our website launch.  She continues to be extremely helpful and responsive.  Jehn was recommended to us by and friend and we would definitely recommend her to others!
