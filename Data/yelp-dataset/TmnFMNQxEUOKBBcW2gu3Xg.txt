4	My sister's iPhone died on her, so we took it to Verizon - they weren't able to fix it, but Brandon was very helpful and tried everything possible. They also informed her that she was available for upgrade and gave her several different options, but wasn't pushy at all. Good service in general.
5	I dont have Verizon service. But I stopped in for a charger. Tiffany talked to me about switching service. She had amazing customer service and she definitely made me want to change to the Verizon network. I will continue to shop there for any accessories I might need until my contract runs out and I can switch. I'd recommend going to tiffany for any issues or severance questions you have.  I will be switching and dealing with her when I am out of contract.
4	1pm...Ok...had to edit my review. After visiting an official Verizon store, viewing the tablet we wanted and then finding out it was on backorder for at least two weeks we called Michael and took him up on his previous offer. An hour after we called, he had the tablet hand delivered to the store. That's impressive. Irene set up our account. She is very knowledgeable about the different phones available, as she was explaining different up-grade options available.  I still don't like the fake phones they have here, but in this instance we are very happy. The stars are for superior customer service. ********************************10 am...Now I remember why I don't like the retailer stores. All of the phones on display were fake. You cannot try them out, you more or less have to guess how they will  work. There were no tablets on display, but Michael pulled out two for us to look at. Unfortunately, they were not what were looking for today. One was a Verizon brand , the other was an older model. Michael was very helpful, and said that he could have the model we were interested in delivered to the store in less than an hour. But you know how it is, people want to see things now.
5	Thank you Irene and Janet, you really saved my day...I really appreciate your time and your patience!! Best customer service I've had in a long time!
