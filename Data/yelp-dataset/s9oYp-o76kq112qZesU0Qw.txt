3	She has some fun tricks, but her presentation is very stiff. I really didn't understand why her female assistants always bared their breasts. She would do a few tricks, then in between the tricks, the assistants would come out and do a dance routine, they'd be dressed (pants, top, hat, etc..)except for the breasts, so sort of like the opposite of wearing only a bra. Bare-breasts wouldn't have been so random if they had done something, like a magic trick where she'd make that part of their tops disappear, or even if they just stood there and stripped, but as it was, there was absolutely no point. and it was not one bit seductive or sexy.
3	Scarlett is really cute and she seems to have a good dynamic with her crew. But her tricks are lackluster and the show isn't exactly "sexy" enough to make up for it. If you can get a good deal on the tickets, take it. It is a true Las Vegas experience, just don't plan your trip around it.
