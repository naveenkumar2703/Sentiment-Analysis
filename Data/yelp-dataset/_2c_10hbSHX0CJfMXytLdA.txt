5	They moved my parent several years ago.  I was so impressed with them that I called them to help me with my move. Flexible, great service reasonable prices.  Took great care with my furniture and belongings.Would enthusiastically recommend them.
5	Can't say enough good things about Meikle Moving. It was my first time paying for movers and they came highly recommended from a friend. The cost was very reasonable, the two movers that came to get my furniture were prompt, speedy, and very careful.The only negative (and it really isn't a negative about them) was when their truck broke down on the way to my new place. They stopped the clock and transferred everything to a new van and everything progressed quickly after that.I'll definitely use them the next time I move.
5	This is a great local moving company. Family owned, great prices, great service.  They moved both us and our neighbors in DC Ranch on the same day and did an awesome job.  Their people are friendly and careful---they actually offer a packing service (we didn't pack ANYTHING) and nothing was broken.  They even packed the food in the pantry and fridge.  We have a huge and valuable art collection which was extremely well taken care of.  Moved us to near Fountain Hills (the other side of the world for them) and then came and picked up all of the boxes, wardrobes and blankets.  If you're moving locally (ask them about out of town moves) they will be thousands less than any of the "major" moving companies.  And, by the way, they had to store our stuff for two weeks between the move out and move-in.  Again, everything showed up in perfect condition and their people worked diligently and carefully throughout.  A definite 5 star recommendation.
