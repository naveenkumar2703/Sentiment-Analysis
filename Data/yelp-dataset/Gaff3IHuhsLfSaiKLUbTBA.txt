3	After writing checks for $13,000 for a landscape install, two months later all there is, is a trench in the front yard. I am not certain if it will ever be done, if they will voluntarily reimburse me or if a lawsuit is in store. I would not recommend this company to anyone.Feb 2014 - The employee of Zona Works who was managing my landscape project has been removed from the company.  The work took a very long time to complete because of who was running the project. The work, once done, was very good and the landscape is beautiful.  There has been a problem with the fire pit they built, and the owner, Gary, has promised to correct it even though he does not stand to make any more money to do so.  At this point I do trust that he will stand by his word to correct the issue. With Gary in charge, I would recommend Zona.
