5	I'm really surprised this Gamestop was not in Yelp. I stopped here for the Xbox One launch and was really impressed with this store. They were very organized and had a line with some staff out front explaining the launch. It went very smooth and I think everyone was happy with it.I came back about a month later to return a couple items that we also got as gifts for the holidays and they were very cool about it. I had my receipts so that made it simple but they were also really friendly and professional. Pretty cool and they know their gaming.
5	By far the best Gamestop to get recently released used games.  Whenever they run their buy 2 get one sale this is where you wanna be.  The staff is also very nice and the store is clean and organized.  Very much my favorite of all the Gamestops.  Now back to Gran Turismo 6!
5	When it comes to gaming, I seriously don't buy anything without first talking to these guys! As a business traveler, that refuses to stop gaming to relieve stress, I look forward to their knowledge when I'm trying to venture outside of my normal FIFA / Battlefield routines. A couple of times I've walked out disheartened by what they've said about a game I thought I'd like - but have gone home to research title suggestions they provided as alternatives! I do ask a few questions (since I know my time will need to be well entertained) and they honestly reply in kind, with no hesitation. Sold. Whomever is the hiring mgr. at this location - Well done!
