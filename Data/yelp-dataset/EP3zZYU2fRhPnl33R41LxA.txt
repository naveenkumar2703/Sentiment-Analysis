4	E:S:I (Englishman: Scotsman: Irishman) is a super-stylish brasserie. From its large open kitchen, it features a range of locally sourced dishes, catering to a range of tastes.Overall, we said: "we were extremely impressed. The new festive menu was really nice, and will no doubt get better as the month goes on. The setting is cool, with the feel of a sharp, modern art gallery about it, a feel which is enhanced by the stylish artwork, on the walls. We took the opportunity to look over their evening menu, so we'll definitely be back to sample their Steak Night, held every Thursday. We look forward to that visit, early in the new year, muchly."
4	The food at E:S:I is fabulous. With the menu reflecting the season, it's good to go every few months just to see what's new. On previous visits I've had the pork belly (fabulous) and the steak (Scottish style, of course). It's worth bearing in mind that Thursday night is steak night and you can get a discounted price on your big slab of meaty goodness. The one thing that upsets me about E:S:I is their cheeseboard: you'd think it would be the perfect opportunity to showcase some artisan cheese from each of the three nations, but sadly the cheese appears to have been bought from the Tesco round the corner. If they can get that sorted out I'm sure I'll be back sooner than anticipated"
3	I think it's closed now - when I went past recently they had a sign saying they were closing down.
