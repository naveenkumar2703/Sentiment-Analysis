5	do you like walks?do you like pretty scenery?how about trees...do you like trees?well then this is the place for you! go for a long, long, long walk surrounded by pretty, pretty, pretty scenery - and trees!
5	Beautiful nature preserve that's excellent for hiking or biking. Very educational Visitors' Center as well.
5	Be still, my heart. The Arb is by far one of the most beautiful places in Madison to walk, run, bike, hike, photograph, bird (that's a verb), ski, research or just chill. I'm working my way up to doing all of these and becoming an Arboretum Black Belt!Last Sunday we biked through the Arboretum as part of Bike & Brunch and HOLY FALL COLORS. Fall is my favorite time to peep the enormous range of gorgeous trees in the area. The multitude of colors in this Southern Wisconsin forest is a sight to see! Do I sound like a tourism catalogue yet?Be sure to check out the trails (http://uwarboretum.org/about/arb_map.pdf) and the Visitor Center for exhibits, cool research they're doing (right now they're researching wild turkey in the area), and tips on the best places to wander.
4	It's hard to believe this little oasis is located smack-dab in the middle of our city. Once inside the area, it feels as though you're a million miles from nowhere. I've only ventured the trails by foot and by bicycle, so I can't comment on the visitor center or amenities. A great place to walk and talk with a friend, although walking along the main entrance road can be a bit hairy; it's a narrow road, and between the automotive, bike, and pedestrian traffic (runners/walkers), it can get a little dangerous. Stick to the marked trails if you can.There aren't many (if any) bathroom facilities; a lone porta-potty sits in the parking lot of the visitor center, and there is a small outhouse in the garden area that's only open in the summer, so take note.Otherwise, plan to meander the area, take-in the vegetation and wildlife, be responsible and courteous, and enjoy the serenity.
