She was very personable and professional all at the same time!Her work  is so fantastic! I showed her a picture from my iPhone and she did even better than the picture! I love her work and I will definitely be a repeat customer!!! Very quick and beautiful work! If you are thinking about getting henna, she is definitely the person to see!
5	Amazing gallery and studio. Jason does the best tattoo work in town. He is also a very talented musician and painter, if you ever have a chance to see him play you definitely should. Note: THIS STUDIO DOES NOT DO HENNA.
