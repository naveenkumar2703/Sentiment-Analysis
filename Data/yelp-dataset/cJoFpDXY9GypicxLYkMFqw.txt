5	Excellent shoes, fabulous service! They really know how to cater to kids and parents, highly recommend this shoe store.
5	This is a great little store, off the beaten path at the company's head office.  They offer a full selection of pediped shoes.  The gal behind the counter was very knowledgeable and nice.  We bought 4 pairs of shoes and will definitely be coming back.  These shoes are amazing!
5	This a great place to buy shoes for small children. It is right next to the distribution center, so they have every shoe/size in existence. The sales woman was very helpful and explained how the insole system works. It is a little hard to find, so bring the address and GPS.
5	Pediped shoes are awesome! I'm going to be sad when my daughter grows out of them. I was so excited when they opened the corporate store. They have a wide selection, which other stores did not. You can even buy online & pick up in the store
5	The pediped store is so cute and their shoes are the only thing my son will keep on his feet!
5	Love this place!!  Wonderful prices, friendly and helpful staff.  So happy I can shop here.
1	What a horrible place. Not only is it ridiculous to put shoes on feet that don't walk; they give such a hardcore sells pitch that you feel like you are abusing your child if you don't buy their over-priced baby shoes. They really do make it sound like your kid will be a limp-cripple if he is denied these shoes. If there is ever a time in your kids' lives when it is ok to not worry about shoes; it is when they are 2 and under.
