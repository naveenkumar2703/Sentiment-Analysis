5	We moved here over a year ago and renewed our lease for another year about 3 months ago.  The maintenance crew is very attentive to any little request, the grounds are well maintained and clean.  They also do so much to foster the sense of community at the complex with get togethers and parties. We have a two bedroom, two bath with (count them) seven closets (one is outside on the balconey).  After we sold our house back east to move out here I never thought we would have this kind of storage and such amazing views to enjoy.  We really love it here.
1	I lived here  a few years ago,  when it was great and safe place to live in. The staff was great and friendly. The floor plans were awesome. Back then I would've rated this place with a five star but from the hell that I had experience, one star is pushing their luck. They wouldn't let me break my lease, all they could offer me was to transfer me to the other side of the building. at that time financially I had no choice, but after transferring, I still felt unsafe so in the end I had to break my lease. SMH They started lowering the price on the rent and HOODLOUMS started moving into the apartment complex and it was all over.My next neighbor robbed me gun point. I know its my next neighbors visitor because the guy had no mask and I had a brawl with the guy and I have seen his face several times. Our leasing office has been broken into and they stoled two gyms television. Need I say more!!!
