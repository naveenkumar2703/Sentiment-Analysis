5	This place beats Starbucks any day! Their coffee is delightful. The people are very welcoming. For the people that stop in on a daily basis, the baristas know their drink and name. To me that is the most important in developing great customer service and relationships. Free wi-fi makes this place even better. Friendly customers and just great ambiance.Yelp can't seem to change the correct address of this place. this place, if you don't know already, it's located on NE corner of Val Vista and Guadalupe where the McDonalds is.
5	Couldn't agree more with the previous Yelper :) This place rocks! Try their Other locations aswell!  (Ray and the I10)
3	As far as coffee shops go, this one ranks as "OK"... The beverages and snacks are good, but the staff could use a few lessons in charm, or at least what it means to work in the hospitality business. Product, pricing, location, selection and cleanliness all rank 4 or 5 stars, but the blank looks and extremely bored attitude of the people working here drag the businesses overall score down.
5	Cool place.
