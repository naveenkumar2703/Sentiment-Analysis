5	The Creative Quest is a terribly cute little store in old-town Glendale.  The shop sells all manner of handmade papers, rubber stamps, scrapbooking notions and book-binding supplies.I originally found this store because it's a great place to buy origami paper.  They take the paper remnants and cut them into squares to be sold in bulk, variety bags.  It's an amazing deal for a collection of fine, textured paper.Check out their website for the workshops going on each month!
4	How could you not like a paper art store in a little historic house in down town Glendale?  The biggest draw to Creative Quest is its wall of handmade papers.  It is the largest selection that I have found on the west side of town.Creative Quest offers a changing supply of stamps, inks, books, and ephemera.  Items usually cost about $.25 more per item than other retailers which can start to add up  if art is not your hobby but your addiction.

1	I was not very impressed with the customer service I rcvd today. I called to see if they had a certain product and the lady who answered the phone seemed put out by having to take my call. Personally she should have just let the answering machine pick up. I was so caught off guard by her rudeness that I was at a loss for words and then she goes on to tell me that the store is closed until January of next year. I don't think I will be stopping by to see the new store once it opens. :(
