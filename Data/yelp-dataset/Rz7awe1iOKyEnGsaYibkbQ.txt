5	I love this place!  I can always find something to buy in here - dresses, tshirts, sweaters, blouses or accessories.  This place has it all and it is very reasonably priced!
5	I always get top notch service at West of Soho. This family owned and operated business is very unique! They have the latest fashion at very reasonable prices. I shop here at least 3 times a month! They are always getting new shipments of clothing and accessories, so they have lots to offer! This is a can't miss shop at Cityscape!
4	Very cute shop in Cityscape, beneath Lucky Strike. They have mens and womens clothes, jewelry, purses, and shoes. I often like the clothes but find the styles a little too over the top, at times. My husband has gotten some unique and fashionable dress shirts, here, too. More recently, I picked up a very cute red, knit head wrap with rhinestones for $14. Very reasonable which is typical of this store.
