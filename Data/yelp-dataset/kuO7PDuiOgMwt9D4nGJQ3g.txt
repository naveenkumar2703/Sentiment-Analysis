3	Ride next to our apartment and decent prices on gas.
4	Recently remodeled (before this review) and it's sooo much better. They've done great things for the inside. Now if they could only update the damn pumps so you don't burn your fingers on the metal numbers when entering your zipcode. Pumps are fast though and there's a SMOG shack in the parking lot.
3	Gas prices not too bad, I guess. This Shell is close to home and very convenient but every time i come here I get hit up for money by someone who "ran out of gas and wondering if I have any change." I don't mind helping out but it just seems like this has become someone's part-time job at this location.
