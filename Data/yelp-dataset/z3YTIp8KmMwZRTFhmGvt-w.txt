4	Sinclair is my favorite gas station in Summerlin.  It has everything you need, you can send out packages from there, it has a Dairy Queen inside, you can drop off and pick up Uhals, has good gas prices, has a car wash, and has any kind of snack you would want.  The employees are friendly and helpful.  And the best part is it's located right next to Summerlin Parkway.
3	People usually come here for two things: Robertos or gas.I like it here because they have a wide assortment of drinks and snacks. And booze. Oh yea, they also have gas! This gas station is actually clean, and it isnt a cluster fook to go to. This is the first place I went to where they had those smaller sodas. Theyre like 12oz, my son and I do not drink sodas, only on special occasions so he likes to get those.The cashiers here are pretty nice and the people arent bad either! They also have a wide assortment of little Sinclair dinos! The only thing I'm not fond of is the prices of gas, theyre always more than other Sinclairs. Also, their car wash thing doesnt accept cash and its priced a little higher also!
2	Great place for gasoline. The store is dirty and poorly maintained. The men's bathroom as broken and tagged up on a recent visit.
3	Gas is a little bit pricey but the lady working the morning shift is very pleasant. That get's my business.
