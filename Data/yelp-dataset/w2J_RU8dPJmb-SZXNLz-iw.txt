5	The best raspados, ice cream and Mexican snacks in Phoenix!
3	Took my nieces here recently for some treats... I was secretly banking on being able to order an "obispo" like I had at that place I reviewed in Tucson ... sadly, they didn't know what I meant, but after explaining to them what I wanted, they made it and it came out semi-close to the Tucson "obispo" I had.The girls got their raspados and ice cream and seemed to be very pleased with the flavor.. also, the ingredients (for most Americans) might seem weird, but believe me, they're not weird for the local latino population... yes, I'm talking about mexican-style candies and sour-things mixed with icees and ice cream...You should give them a shot.. they're not cheap by South Phoenix standards and they get hella busy on the weekend afternoons, but it's something new for your to try and I"m pretty sure you'll enjoy what you eat... unless you don't get intimidated :)
2	This place is meh. I have no idea why its always full. As a previous reviewer mentioned, they did not carry a specific item I was wanting, in my instance however it was a diablito I was looking for.
4	They have some good raspados with ice cream. They also make some different treats that are normal. It does get busy and long lines can happen especially if people order a lot. I recommend a raspado with ice cream and fruit a good treat for a hot summer.
5	If you're craving fresh fruit on an ice cream slushie, this is the place!  My favorite is strawberry,  mango,  coconut w/ leches. Plan to be patient because there's often a line,  but the service is quick and very friendly. The restaurant is nice and clean. Not to many tables, so you might want to ask for a top & get it to go. Owners run a tight ship and do a great job!
