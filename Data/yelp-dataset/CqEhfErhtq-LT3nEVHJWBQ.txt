3	This Playboy store location gets a C-.LOCATION: Inside of the aging, smoky Palms casino in the back,near the Playboy Club entrance (elevator). Careful or you'll miss it.WALK TIME: Around 8 mins. PARKING: Easy. Park in the structure at the bottom.CELEBRITY: None. This Playboy store has been on The Girls NextDoor many times but be warned - this place is SMALL. I expected tosee busty blondes but instead we were greeted with barely legalVegas youth. Whatever. The salesyouth have no personality - theydon't want to answer questions about Bridget, Kendra or Holly. LOL.SHOP APPEAL: Selections are limited. I rarely see sales. They now have mens clothing. The dressing room is cool. SALES POLICY: No refunds. Exchanges with 3 days only with original receipt. I always forget this and regret my purchases thenext day but oh well. ADVICE: If you see something you like in here, go online... it's probably on sale and/or cheaper. Bought a shirt here for $36 andsaw it online the next day for 2 for $48. DAMN! The Playboy store at The Forum Shops is 10x better.
2	The store is set up beautifully. You walk by & you can't help but stop in. Once inside, you realize all they have to sell is tees & bras & a few little trinkets. I was bummed that they didn't have more than what they did. The bras were all in itty bitty boobie sizes. I was hoping to buy some ultra sexy lingerie but was stunned that the store had none. They had one employee working & she was very friendly & helpful...not to mention Gorgeous... I think her name was Nikki. The prices are not competitive with the online gear at all. Everything in here is almost double what you'd pay online. They have an ultra sheek dressing room that's worth checking out though. :)
