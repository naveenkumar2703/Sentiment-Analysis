4	At Terminal 4 near the West end baggage claim level, doggies can stretch their little legs. The "Bone Yard" is a great pet-and-their-people rest area. It includes watering areas, a gravel area for potty breaks, and "mutt mitts" for cleaning up.In Terminal 3, the "Paw Pad" is a fenced area with water spigots and bowls, paw shaped decorations, and a fun red fire hydrant.
4	Sky Harbor makes it a lot easier for those of us who travel with fury friends.  Nice touch!
5	This airport is great. It's big clean and the staff are friendly. The bus terminals are quick. Maybe I should make a trip to Phoenix instead of staying here over four hours on a connecting flight. Place looks amazing.
