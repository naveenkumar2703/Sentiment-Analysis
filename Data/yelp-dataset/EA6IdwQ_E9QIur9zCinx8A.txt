3	This Circle K is very convenient on & off the 101 near Desert Ridge and the gasoline prices are great (worth the trip)!
1	I went in for gas and the CC  machine wasn't working properly. I had some gas in the car, but decided to fill it. Their gas prices are reasonable. I paid the clerk $20 with the same CC. Apparently, I only needed $17 worth. The clerk (caucasian man in his low-50's) refused to give me my 3 bucks back. He was a total ass!
2	This is one of the dirtiest gas stations I have ever encountered.  A little power-washing would go a long way.  Or, if that is too difficult, perhaps try simply emptying the overflowing trash cans periodically?  At any given time, a minimum of 3 of the 12 pumps are out of order.  The ones that do work are covered with scratched-in graffiti markings.  Classy.The only redeeming quality is that the gas is usually a few cents cheaper than nearby competitors.  The only reason I keep coming back.I guess you really do get what you pay for...
