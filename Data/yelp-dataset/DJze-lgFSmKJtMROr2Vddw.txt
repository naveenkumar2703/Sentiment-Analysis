4	I have been driving by this little market for quite a while now, and finally decided to go check it out. What a gem. It doesn't look like much form the outside, but is truly a great little market for the area. It's filled wiht tons of Asian staples, an entire aisle of different noodles and a pretty good meat/fish window. This is very reminiscent of the litle market's I'd frequent in Seattle/Tacoma growing up. Don't be turned off by the crappy exterior and parking lot, trust me it's worth walking in.

4	Two Words. Banh BaoBeyond the beat down appearance and rough exterior lies an Asian grocery store that can satisfy your basic needs for Asian cooking.  The owners are great and very friendly and you can count on good suggestions and even a little cultural history on Vietnamese cuisine.  Aside from the groceries that are present with your can goods, spices, fresh Asian vegetables, and your selection of meats and seafood, what should draw you in is the small display of cooked and prepared foods in the back.  When ready and fresh are delicious and convenient to buy and take home to eat for dinner which will save you the time to prepare these Vietnamese dishes.  For me the hidden gem of Phoenix and Arizona is there Banh Bao.  This is a steamed Asian pastry filled with barbeque and steam pork with quarter of a hard boiled egg.  When eaten fresh out of the oven, the ingredients melt in your mouth combining the sweetness of the dough mixed with the savoriness of the pork meat.  I only wish this was made daily.
