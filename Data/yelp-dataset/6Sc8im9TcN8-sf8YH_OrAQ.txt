4	OK, so this Gilbert Red Brick Pizza isn't that much different than the other Gilbert Red Brick Pizza. BUT, one thing different is, I never tried the gelato at the other one. Big mistake!Red Brick Pizza's gelato is made in the store fresh every day. They rotate between 50 flavors, offering 12 at a time. I thought the pizza was a little shy on the sauce and the store wasn't as clean as the one I usually go to, but it's hard to complain when the gelato's this good!
3	For cheap and fast pizza this place is good. I go every once in a while to get a pizza. Seriously, its chain and it tastes like one. Go if you want some fast cheap pizza, don't expect Grimaldi's or anything.
4	It really is good for the money. They have great salads too. Very fresh. Kids loved this pizza too.
4	this pizza is so so. i get pizza there for my husband and son. they seem to like it and they have a coupon card. so every pizza you order you get some $ off. we paid $2.00 tonight for our pizza. great deal.
4	Took my kids there everything came out quick and we ate it all.  Kids wanna go back.
