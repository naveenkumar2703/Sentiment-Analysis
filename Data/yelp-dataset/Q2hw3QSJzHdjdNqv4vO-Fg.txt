5	These guys are known for producing custom built off-road recreational vehicles, but my need was something very different. I was creating a steel cage to cover a custom built speaker box for my vehicle, but the thickness of the steel I was working with was much to rigid  for the average person to shape. Thus, I came upon Foddrill Fabrication. On approach to the address, I passed by more than once due to the building looking like a residential home. I believe the building observable from W Union Hills Drive IS a home. A quick phone call later, and I was directed to the North end of the property, where the metal fabrication shop was found behind a large sliding push gate. Several employees were actively working on creating the custom vehicles the company is known for, and a large bald man greeted me near an open garage door. I explained what I wanted him to do, and he got right to it. 25 minutes later, the work was done and I have no complaints. The bends were accurate and the fit was just right. Afterward, he directed me to the office and a very polite woman told me "no charge". Considering that these guys get $35 for a half hour of work, I was ecstatic. Much like my previous post, the shop is very blue collar, but the results are outstanding. Highly recommended.
