3	I can't say I'm a huge fan of McDonald's in general. But this location is literally right across the street... so sometimes when I'm feeling lazy, I'll grab some grub there.Normally I'd give McDonalds 2 stars, but today when I stopped by here with the boyfriend... we waited. And waited. The boyfriend decided to go up to the counter to inquire about our order and not only did they apologize multiple times, but they gave us free large fries and 2 free apple pies.So, thanks McDonalds! I like free food. :)
4	I eat McDonald's probably 1-2 times a year, but sometimes you just crave a double quarter pounder with cheese. Ya know? This one is across the street from my part-time, so it's usually a waited-way-too-long-to-eat-lunch-now-I'm-starving-and-I-want-food-right-meow trip.
1	I think I may have food poisoning after eating here 4-5 hours ago. Achy joints, running to the bathroom, chills... Friggin' McDonalds.
5	We just got ice cream cones as a family and the workers were awesome!!! We asked for extra large cones and they definitely made them XL! Fast service for a quick, cheap treat!
