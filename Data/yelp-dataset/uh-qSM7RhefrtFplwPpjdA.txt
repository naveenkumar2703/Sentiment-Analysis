5	The best dentist EVER! From the time you walk in, Maria is warm and friendly. To seeing Dr. Hsu she's informative as to procedures, and an infectious laugh. I'm sending my wife and kids, ASAP.
5	Finally a dentist that cares. Pecos dental goes above and beyond to make sure that I'm taking care of. I always enjoy my interaction with my the entire staff. I highly recommend them to anybody looking for a dentist.
5	Dr. Hsu is the consummate professional and she provides the ultimate in dental care. Until I met Dr. Hsu, I had never come in contact with a dentist who did not think that all wisdom teeth are bad, that they must be immediately removed and whom even inferred that to not have done so already, put the patient's intelligence in question. I had a wisdom tooth that was going bad and she suggested several alternatives for its remedy. There was no pressure to have it removed. We eventually decided on a crown, which was no easy task for any dentist. But, she got it done. That was 10 years ago and I still have my tooth. Pecos Dental is highly recommended and as long as Dr. Hsu is practicing, I will go nowhere else.
5	I have been coming here for several years now.  After absolutely hating going to the dentist all my life,  this is the only dentist I don't mind coming too.  I drive across the valley to see her, and would drive across the state if need be.  Wait times are very minimal,  and she is great with kids...5 stars all the way.
