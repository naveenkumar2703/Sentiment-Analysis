5	I have been doing business with Brian for over a year now and even though I pass several printers to get his business, it is definitely worth it. He is efficient and prompt.  He always goes that extra mile to make to make sure his work exceeds your expectations.
5	I drive over 30 miles for the services Brian offers. I pass several cartridge stores and printing. Brian provides detailed service and quality products. It is worth the time to go out to Goodyear and work with Brian.
5	Good deal on color printing here. They charge by the amount of coverage on the page, so color prints can be less expensive if there is a lot of white space in your document.  Quick turnaround and personal service. Definitely worth using and a local small business as well.
1	They are not a print shop. every thing they do is sent out and because of this they missed our dead line and we had to go to our convention with out our literature to hand out. it would have been nice for them to let us know about this.  the owners aditude was ' WHAT DO U WANT ME TO DO ABOUT IT" STAY AWAY
