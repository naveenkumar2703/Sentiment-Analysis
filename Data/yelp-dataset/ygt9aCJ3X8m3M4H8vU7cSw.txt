4	The best Friday all you can eat fish I know of. $9.00 gets all u can eat cod, served with frys and slaw. The fish is consistant and good. The service is great. AND They serve MT DEW....yummyThere is also a Fudge stand with homemade fudge from one of the employees. It might be the best I have ever had. (including Macinac Islands) Give it a try. Oh, they have a magician who wanders around too. He is excellent!
5	I can't find a better deal for such great fish....
3	Went here for lunch while visiting Pioneer Village. We all ordered cheeseburgers and thought they were really good. There is a really neat old bar in there worth checking out.
4	Saddens me to drop a star but tonight's fish was not up to par. It was a different breading and not as good. Service was almost bad, no refills on water, never received the beer we asked for, and never received the last refill of fish. The wife salad was just ok, they were out of blue cheese. I swear shit like this only happens when she goes with me there. LOL
4	Best breakfast burrito EVER!! Their hours are weird so pay attention! Wednesday-Saturday, 6 a.m-9 p.m.Sunday, 6 a.m.-2 p.m.Serving breakfast, lunch, dinner
4	Good food and plenty of it.  Worth a stop for sure, make sure you also see the Pioneer Village as well.
