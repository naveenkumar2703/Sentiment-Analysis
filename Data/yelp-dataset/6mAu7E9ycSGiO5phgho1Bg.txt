2	I used to have a friend whose favorite drunken prank was to jack someone's camera, quickly snap a picture of his balls sitting in an ashtray, and then quietly slip the camera back to them.This place smells like just that: Balls, and ashtray. The security is fucking out of control. They give you ins and outs, but even after you've gotten a wristband, you have to wait in line along with the losers who haven't paid yet! And trust me, you want those ins and outs. The circulation in this place is horrible. The inside reeks and it's so full of smoke you can barely see three feet in front of you.Oh well. Sound was good. And the Dwarves were worth seeing, even if it was at this crappy place.
4	This is a place where you can come to and don't have to worry about all the Vegas glitz and glamour.  If you are looking for that, there is plenty of it on the strip.  Here you can just be yourself and have fun.  Drinks are cheap, parking lot is huge and free.  Easy to get in and out of and alot of space.  I don't notice any abnormal smells, so I guess since 2009 they cleaned the place up.
2	They had a ladies night here a few weeks back. A male review. The facility is old and needs to be re done. Like the first reviewer it definitely has a smell. I'm not sure of balls and ashtray but its something alright. I'll pass on the next event they offer here.
