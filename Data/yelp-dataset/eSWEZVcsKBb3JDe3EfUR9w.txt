3	Not a bad place to check out.  If your in the downtown area check out circles, the people there are friendly, knowledgeable and can always help you.Good Place to check out some new and used music, there Record selection is ok but how many stores actually sell Records now, hopefully this store will keep its head above the water.
1	I live in a town that has a half a dozen of the finest record stores in the country, so I'm spoiled.  But I always enjoy seeing what other places have to offer, so when I spotted Circles while riding the light rail, I knew I had to check it out.  This is by far the worst record store I've ever been in.They do have tapes, so if you're coming here in your time machine from 1985, I guess you're in luck.  Or they do seem to specialize in hip-hop vinyl.  Not that they have a lot of it, but it is the only vinyl they have.  The rest of the store is a misorganized mish mash of overpriced CDs.  The store is huge, it could be a kick ass store, especially given the location.  Unfortunately as it stands, I see no reason for anyone from music snob to casual CD buyer to ever shop here.  Unless all you have is a tape player.
