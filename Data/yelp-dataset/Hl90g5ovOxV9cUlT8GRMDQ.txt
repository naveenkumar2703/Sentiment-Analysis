3	Holy cow. Talk about needing to increase staffing. So I walk in and there's two people in the waiting room, this should go quick right ? Well I get told there is an hour wait. Well I'm already here, might as well wait. Hour goes by and were through both people in front of me and I continue just to sit there. They don't do appointments. So this is really the only choice. I would go elsewhere in the future. Extra star is because it is a nice area that is kept clean. The staff did acknowledge the longer wait time and apologized, which means a lot to me.
1	We have been waiting 70 minutes for a simple chest X-ray. None of the staff seams bothered that patients are upset with the long wait.  Finally, and procedure took all of 1 minute. I would not recommend this place.
1	people here are not friendly and long time waiting.... also charged me wrong amounts....
