5	I have known them from their incubation days. Humble start up, nice people and they make great food. I ordered biryani twice from them (one for a big birthday party) and it tasted so authentic both of the times. Not so pricey and this could be very well one of the best biryanis in the valley. Just make sure to mention about the spicy/hotness level in the food when you order.
5	Wonderful and yummy biryani! We have had food catered from this group several times. Recently we ordered veg and chicken biryani. Both were delicious!
1	I placed an order 2 days in advance for my boyfriends birthday party by calling their number.  The guy on the phone was not prepared to take my order and instead of taking my order and information, the he asks me to send them my order via e-mail.  Without much direction, I send an e-mail with my order.  I didn't check my e-mail within a day and my order was cancelled.  Regardless of the fact, that I called them immediately the following morning at 8:00AM and repeatedly calling and emailing again hoping to get my order through.  The guy finally calls by back at 3:30 informing me that he could not fulfill my order and that he had been away from his business phone and he had clearly lost number from before so he could not call me.  Needless, to say I had no food for my party......
