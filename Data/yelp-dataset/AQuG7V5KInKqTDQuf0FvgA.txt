1	This place is a joke.  I went there for used Blu-Ray DVDs.  I spotted The Matrix Trilogy and the price was $36.99.  I also spotted Snow White Diamond Edition for $44.99.  I took them both up and asked the cashier, "Do you sell any used Blu-Rays?"  He told me that they were all used.WHAT!!!!!????The Matrix Trilogy was selling for $32.99 BRAND NEW at Best Buy.  Snow White is available for around $30.00 BRAND NEW.  After this fiasco, I decided to go over and look at the games.I spotted Rage for the PS3 used...For $44.99.  WalMart had it for $25 at that time.  I will never go back to this store.  Obviously they are trying to perfect the art of ripping people off and charging more for used items than brand new items at the local stores.  No thanks!
4	They have OK deals. Some things are priced better than others, I like this place 10x more than Gamestop though (better selection and deals)  the staff here is also friendly and helpful.
1	no......just no!
3	There's not a whole lot to say about this place. It's your standard pre-played games and movies store. The staff is pretty quiet, but they're not rude or anything, they always have a pretty decent selection of games for prices that are generally lower than you'll find at a Gamestop. The place always seems so sterile whenever I've been in, but that's better than the alternative.One thing I have to commend them on is that their stocking system seems to make actual sense. Usually at used video game stores I'm left looking at an entire area just browsing and there's no rhyme or reason to where things are put. In contrast, this place is very well organized.
