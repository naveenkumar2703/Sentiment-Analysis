1	The food was at best mediocre and the service was slow even though it was completely empty.  Not recommended.  Masala Bay on Regina and Erb has much better Indian food.
3	I have to agree, service was slow despite how desolate the restaurant. Food was good and service is extra polite. The workers at this restaurant are very very humble. I believe the food is cooked fresh, so this is a huge positive, compared to so many buffet style restaurants. It also explains the longer than usual wait times.
3	I have a friend that likes to come here for lunch on a regular basis, and I will tag along from time to time.  It's a small Indian restaurant with a great eat-in lunch menu that includes soup and rice or naan.The issue I have with this place is the inconsistency in the service and the quality of the food.  Sometimes the food is great and the service is fast.  Other times it seems that you have the service very slow and you have to ask for every single little thing, which seems to just annoy them and make the service even slower.Also, although the lunch specials are a reasonable price (although the portion can be a bit on the small side), the dinner pricing is pretty expensive for what you get.
4	Nice little restaurant with great service. We had no problem with time, but we did let them know that we planned to be out the door in half an hour after ordering. Got our food in 15 minutes. Bit pricey for lunch.$5.50 lunch special that they sometimes advertise on a sign outside is a decontented lunch special you probably won't order (soup, green salad, naan).... the majority of the other lunch specials are $7.50 to $8.50 in price.I don't eat spicy food, and I found the "Medium" in the Chicken Mushroom Curry ($7.50) to be not spicy at all.Watch out for the upsell. Particularly things like "Did you want any Naan?" because it does cost extra.
