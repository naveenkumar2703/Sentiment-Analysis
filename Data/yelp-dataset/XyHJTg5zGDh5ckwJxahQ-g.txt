5	JoAnn is a very gifted therapist and uses a gentle and effective touch to resolve sore muscles and pain. The first time she did a cranial sacral session, I had such a tight calf muscle due to overplaying sports (sand volleyball). I felt instant relief and was playing again in 2 days. She is excellent for pain relief and can help pinpoint the core issue and provide relief in such a gentle manner. Highly recommend!!
5	Joann Is so amazing. If you ever want craniosacral therapy, she is the woman to go to. Shes extremely knowledgeable, gentle, and in tuned to your needs. I would definitely recommend her!
5	Enjoyed reflexogy session with Joann. ^_^Quite knowledgeable, and warm. My session was very relaxing as well. My only complaint is that I only opted for 60minutes! Lol.Give Joann a go. She also offers craniosacral therapy -- my next session!
5	JoAnn is professional, knowledgable, kind, and extremely effective!  Thank you for a great experience and beneficial work.  I met with three different massage therapists (MT) to help me eliminate trigger points in my hand, arm, shoulder and neck associated with wrist and thumb pain.  JoAnn is one of the best and I look forward to working with her further in the future.  JoAnn's excellent practice will make you feel comfortable and relaxed while the work that she does effectively mitigates pain.  Thank you!
