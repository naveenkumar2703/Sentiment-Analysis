3	The yogurt here is pretty good and the setup matches that of U-Swirl. They have two sizes of bowls and the yogurt is $0.45/oz. The fruit toppings are big and fresh, but their liquid toppings are sparse---just white chocolate and caramel. The one thing they have here that isn't at the U-Swirls I've been to is that you can mix the side-by-side yogurts together. I would only go here if I was at the mall, but I was pretty satisfied with my frozen yogurt 'cause I ate it all.
4	Its pretty yummy here!! I love they have super fresh fruit and yummy candies/junk. Im not too crazy about the tart flavor, but the vanilla and asp pom was delish!!They have 3 sizes and at the end I paid 3.90 for a pretty good portion. The customer service here is super and thats why I would go back!! Everything is fresh, yummy, and theyre super sweet!
4	My hubby and I stopped by here while at the Meadows Mall.  I was not expecting much as I am not an ice cream person.  My husband chose the raspberry pomegranate and love it so much he wished he filed up the whole cup.  I had the tart flavor and was super pleased!  The flavors were great!  I liked that that the calories were listed, it made it easier to decide on how much to get.  We'll definitely be back!
