5	Great stuffed pizza.  Great price for so much.
3	Pretty good sandwiches, and thin crust pizza. Dont care for their Chicago deep dish,stuffed,or pan style pizza,because it tastes like they use margerine in the crust instead of half margerine, half butter, which is the way I like the Chicago deep dish crust to be made. Try the Valentino, on thin crust,and it will spin your cap for sure,and they have a good italian beef sandwich,and sausage sandwich.Overall,its a bit pricey,but they do have some very good choices. They also charge 2.50 for a delivery fee!
5	I must say perfect... I travel for work and it was great to check into my room, find Rosati's on Yelp and have them here within 30 minutes. The food was much more than I anticipated...  A MUST try. Very well seasoned and the service was great from the phone call to the delivery... 5 stars all around!  The Spinach and Tomato Garlic bread was delicious!
3	I love their thin crust pizza but I always feel a little ripped off which keeps me from ordering from them often.  They charge a steep delivery fee which if not taken form the tip makes a pizza almost 28 bucks.  Other places around here have bullshit delivery fees (along with bitchy statements about not taking the fee out of your tip, as if the person buying the food is responsible for the shitty wage the store pays or the tacked on fee that apparently does not actually support delivery) but they are usually less.
4	The huge thin crust supreme pizza we had was delicious! If we lived here, we would be returning.
1	I was in town for the weekend with my son (13) and his friend. asked the front desk at my hotel if there was any good Chicago style pizza places in Madison. I was directed to rosati's. such a disappointment. very bland & the crust...just no. the teenagers even thought it was mediocre. we each tried a slice, put the rest in the hall & called a different place.
