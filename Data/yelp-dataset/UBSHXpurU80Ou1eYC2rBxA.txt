5	Dr. Anderson is a great optometrist!  My husband and I have been going to his office for 2 years now and will continue to go to this office for the foreseeable future.  Dr. Anderson is very nice and kind.  He takes his time during the exam and makes you feel welcome and at home.  He isn't pushy nor does he rush through the exam to hurry you out for the next appointment.  He really listens to your concerns and issues and really works to get your issues sorted out quickly and effectively.Now we all know who really makes an office and that is the office staff.  Everyone I have encountered at this office is friendly and helpful.  They are all nice and easy to talk to during your visit.  The nurses (not sure what to call the people who run the eye tests) are very nice and help you do all of the tests, including that awful "puff of air in the eye" glaucoma test that I have to do 5 times before I don't blink in the middle of it!  They also let you take your time looking at the frames, which with me took FOREVER because I can't ever decide on frames.  No one makes you feel rushed or like you are a pain, even if you are being one, kinda sorta.  Everyone is very even tempered and a pleasure to do business with.If you need your eyes checked or a stylish new pair of glasses, go check out Dr. Anderson and be pleasantly surprised at the service you will receive from his office.
5	I just moved to a new part of town and I was in need of new Optometrist. Dr Anderson is the first Optometrist that I REALLY like. He took his time to answer ALL of my questions. For example, I asked about the differences between generic and name brand contact solutions. His answers were easy to understand and informative. The office staff was friendly and helpful. If you don't love your Optometrist ... switch!
