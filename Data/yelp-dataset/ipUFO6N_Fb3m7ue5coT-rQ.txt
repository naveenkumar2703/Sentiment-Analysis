4	Good priced shoe brands like Nike, Adidas, Aerosoles, Clarks, Born, New Balance, and so much more. If you have the loyalty card, you can earn discounts on purchases. Usually has an ongoing promotion, Buy One Get the 2nd Pair for 50% off. (Yeah, I know, really trying to get you to buy more without having to twist your arm.) I used to shop here a lot but lately been browsing;  still trying to figure out my final decision. (See, I've been debating buying things online to earn more miles with Hawaiian Airlines.)I like the set-up, continuous rows of shoes according to type of shoes- flip flops, sandals, heels, boots, athletic, toning shoes. All the accessories like socks are in one section. One side is womens and the other is mens. One section dedicated to clearance shoes according to size in the far right corner, for ladies. Because the set-up is easy, so is finding what you want. And there are pantyhose footie cheapies (located in boxes nearby) to wear if you're sockless. Plus, benches and mirrors to further assist you in your shoe purchase. A dependable source for all recognizable shoe brands.
5	I was very impressed with the service, selection, and overall appearance/setting of this location.  I do a fair amount of shopping at the Famous Footwear location in Honolulu, and I don't mind saying that I would visit this location on future trips to Las Vegas.I liked the selection as far as casual and dress shoes, and was happy to have found a pair of Steve Madden shoes for an affordable price (in my humble opinion).  NOTE:  If you're a fan of Steve Madden shoes, there are more men's shoes selections at this outlet location than there are at the actual Steve Madden store at the very same shopping complex.  SERVICE:  Top notch.  Friendly and helpful sales associates are present throughout the store.Bottom Line:  Great selections and customer service.
