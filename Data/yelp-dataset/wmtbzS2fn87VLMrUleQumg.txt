4	Its a cleaner. They're fast, friendly and priced decently. I paid just under $18 for 6 shirts most were simply laundered and ironed while 1 of the shirts went to dry cleaning. My clothes came out clean and smelling fresh so I now smell clean fresh which makes me and anyone standing close to me very happy.PS.. they're located right next to Jamba Juice if you want to grab a wheat grass shot.
5	Just dropped off 2pc suit and a vest for dry cleaning along with a pair of jeans for hemming. Total cost: $23.80... And could be ready on Wednesday. I opted for pickup on Friday instead. This is not the 1st time I've used this cleaners. I love this place!  Fast, Friendly, and Affordable! The hemming and patch work has always been impeccable!
