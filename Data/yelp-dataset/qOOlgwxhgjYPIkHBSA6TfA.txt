3	Normally when I go for pizza I don't usually go to Pizza Express, however on a Wednesday (mainly due to Orange Wednesday offers) I do like to pay it a visit. However, I just don't go to any Pizza Express! Oh no, I go to the one in Stockbridge! The reason is not just due to the good service but due to its building and setting! Spread over two floors there are plenty of seats indoors, however on a hot Summer's day there is also a terrace where one can eat pizza and drink a nice glass of white wine! And this seating area has views over the river of Leith. Doesn't sound very glamour's, but at times it can be quite nice! One of the better places to go for a bite to eat in the area, you will be eating in, not your average Pizza Express but Stockbridge's pizza Express!

Whatever decision you reached, this branch is not going to change your mind.A couple of things to note though. As the pictures posted by other reviewers show, this particular restaurant sits on a river called the Water of Leith. If weather permits, pizza by the water would probably be lovely. If not, the window seats will still give you  nice view out onto the water.It's more cramped in here than in most pizza express restaurants. It's a great place to eavesdrop, if that's what you're after, but I bringing children in here would be stressful.
1	Although the place is quite nice the service was just awful. When we had our drinks they gave us a very dirty glass. Who couldn't they notice? We waited for almost 30 minutes to have our food and to be honest it's too expensive for what you have. I'm definitely not trying again.
