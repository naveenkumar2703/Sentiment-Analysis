5	This is a great bookstore if you are looking for a gift or even for yourself.  They have everything from religious books, top sellers, music, art, CD's.  They have a great children's section as well.Sign up for their members reward program.  They have two of them.  One is free and the other is $25 a year.  You earn points (5 and 10% respectivly) towards merchandise.  You also get their catalog and it includes a coupon.  I also check out their clearance section.  They have two- one for adults and one for children.  They are always offering deals there.  If you have not been in a while I would go.  I would avoid though right before Mother's Day and Christmas.  Those are the two busiest times.At this location they also have a lion house pantry and limit Mormon handicraft items.  If you catch the right person there they will give samples of cookies.  The area for children is really good here as well.  My children love it at this one.  They have in the past had story hour, but it has been hit and miss lately.
4	This is wonderful bookstore where you can purchase both Christian and LDS items.I've been coming here for several years, mostly to sit and read, but also to have a late lunch at The Lion House Pantry.  The food is great and the store also has home baked goods and breads prepared by several of the Moms.  Nice!Being a non-Mormon, I've found the staff both friendly and helpful and have never been proselytized.  Since I do have several Mormon friends,  I've found the Deseret Bookstore a good place to go to purchase hard to find Holiday gifts.Enjoy!
5	This location has the Lion House Pantry/Bakery and O-M-Gosh, you have to try the cherry pie. The. Best. I've. Ever. Had. Period. The staff is always friendly & the food is phenomenal!
