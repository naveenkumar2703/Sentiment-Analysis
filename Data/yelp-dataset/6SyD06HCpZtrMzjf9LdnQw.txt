5	This place is fantastic. We have been coming here for years. The Rainbow Company offers great drama classes for youth here. My daughter loves them. The staff couldnt be more wonderful! I believe they offer dance classes here too, not sure though. They have a theatre here also where they put on a lot of different types of performances. We have seen many plays here put on by The rainbow Company and have thouroughly enjoyed them all.
4	I've been to several shows at the Arts Center.  The theatre is a fairly large performance area with seating for several hundred people.This is the new home for all productions of the Rainbow Theatre Company since the building they were using on Las Vegas Boulevard was being closed and then taken over by another company.There are rotating art exhibits here.  Parking is available in the lot and on street.  Last night's production of Charlotte's Web was very well done!  The kids do a great job!
4	We went to a free showing of "Meet me in St. Louis" here and the staff was very nice and I think surprised as well, being that I was the 2nd youngest person in the theatre....the youngest being my 3 year old son. I love classical movie plus musicals, but I tend to not be able to concentrate when I watch them in the comfort of my own home. So I like going out and watching them. I hope they have more of these type of things, and I have even thought about taking some sort of class here.
