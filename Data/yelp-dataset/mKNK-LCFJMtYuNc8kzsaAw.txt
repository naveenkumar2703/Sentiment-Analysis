5	Best drink selection in town and friendly helpful staff. Police get free drinks so the stores have regular drop in security;)
5	No problems at this QT.  As expected. Always prefer them if there's one around, over all other similar convenience stores.
5	This is a great QT for when you're driving through Phoenix on I-17. It's right off the freeway so it's perfect for stopping for gas and grabbing a tasty snack.Plus it's a QuikTrip, there isn't really any part of it that isn't awesome.
5	This QT located at 39th and Greenway is my favorite.  The staff are fast, friendly and the restrooms are always clean.  This QT is not nearly as busy as the others which makes it a more pleasant experience.  My only gripe is that they charge .79 cents for a fountain drink ( 32oz ) when I can get a 44oz in a styrofoam cup at Circle K for the same price.This QT is my QT of choice !
5	Always enjoy going to Quiktrip as the employees are friendly and if there is a problem they will do what they can to assist or fix it.  Haven't been to a bad one yet and I have been to a lot of them.
4	Love the product, hate the customers in this area. I always get really really weirded out walking from my car all the way to the gas station inside, especially at night. I'm just lucky that at night it's so well lit, otherwise this would be extra shady.
