4	I have always loved this place! Even dating back to the Factory 2-U stores. I used to shop the location off of Decatur a lot when I lived in Summerlin. Was so happy this location opened just months before my move back to Green Valley.This store is way smaller than the Decatur location but it doesn't lack the deals. I find some of the same product here that I find at that other location but just not as much. I also have to say that the clientele is better here despite being approached by a customer during my last visit trying to sell me cheap jewelry!I mainly shop this location for home decor and accessories. The clothing at this location doesn't even compare to the one on Decatur near the Meadows Mall. That location has Levi's jeans, semi-designer shoes and sports jerseys. This one has hardly any clothing worth lifting off the racks for a closer look.Good thing I have enough clothes. Home decor is awesome here and the prices are super awesome. I'm a fan and will be here a lot!
