4	My teenager doesnt exactly look like a thug, but he's a big kid with beard stubble in a hooded sweatshirt and basketball shorts.  Not your typical H&D customer. He was in there just before Christmas, when it was human gridlock, and couldnt find a particular item on display - it cost around $7.  So, he asked a clerk, who cheerfully volunteered to scour the back room, and who located a case of crystalized ginger, to complete the sale.  People will say that's what a clerk "should" do, but we all know it often doesnt happen that seamlessly - especially not under those circumstances.Very pleased.
