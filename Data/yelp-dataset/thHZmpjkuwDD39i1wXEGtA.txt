1	One star is to much to rate!! Warning... This place will try to rip you off when mailing packages..... Priority us mail fate rate box..... Trying to state it goes goes by weight and  size , not what is clearly stated on the box printed by the USPS! Tried to double charge me! Stated he has been doing this for years and knows rates etc etc...(NOTICE NO PRICE CHART IN THE STORE FOR USPS PRIORITY SHIPPING).. 5 mins down the street is a USPS .... My box flat rate 12.34 , this place. Wanted 22.00!!!  Don't support a place they wants to rip of their clients!!  Don't get ripped off here!
