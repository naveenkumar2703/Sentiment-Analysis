5	The customer service people, at least at this Taco Bell, are named, 'Customer Maniac.' I did receive 'jazz hands' when I walked through the door so they were excited to see me. The food was prepared to my enjoyment. The chicken soft tacos were hot and the Mountain Dew Baja Blast was ice cold. Thank you Taco Bell & Paul the 'Customer Maniac' for providing a good experience.
5	I freaking love Taco Bell. Every time a cheesy gordita crunch is in my presence, I bust out the kleenex and vaseline.THANK GOD FOR TACO BELL!
4	This review is solely for their Beefy Crunch Burritos aka BCBs. I first tried one last year at UNLV's taco bell and I was blown away. CHIPS in a burrito?! I'm all for crunchy things in a not so crunchy food thing. Yep then it was taken away for a short while but BROUGHT BACK! I didn't even have to do anything. Beef, cheese, rice, and spicy Fritos....omg. Best eaten with Mild sauce. Please never take the BCB away again. Oh and 4 stars for this location for having pink water. What....?
1	We were the fifth car in the drive-thru line.  It took 30 minutes for us to get our food.  It was unbelievable.  Even more frustrating is that once we got to the window, we sat there for 10 minutes while we watched them serve three inside guests.  I think this is because once you're in the drive-thru lane, there's no way out.  Since they know you can't leave, they don't give a shit how long it takes to get your food.It literally became night while we were waiting for our food.  I will never go back to this Taco Bell again.
1	Some kind of NASTY smell comes from this place. you can smell it out in the parking lot and all over the shopping center its in.service is slow and all the little high school kids that work there are rude and have no regard for health or sanitation.... how about we try to put gloves on once in a while... that would be lovely.
