5	We just spent two nights at Spur Cross and found it clean, comfortable, and welcoming.  The location is convenient and the views of the desert are amazing.  We would stay there again if in need of accommodations in that area.
5	We occasionally travel to Arizona for family events. Have visited Flagstaff which was very pretty but usually spent time in Phoenix and found it to be less than beautiful. While we enjoyed seeing family, the area had very little that appealed to us. This trip however, we saw a whole new side to Arizona in Cave Creek while in town for a wedding. The town and surrounding areas offered some lovely views and a completely different feel than the big city of Phoenix. The Spur Cross is not the typical Victorian B&B (thank goodness) but fits in perfectly with it's surroundings and is the perfect place to stay in this charming town. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the breakfasts were delicious. Carolyn is a wonderful hostess and made us feel so welcome. What a great little town, we love this B&B and would recommend it highly. Because of our wonderful experience here, we have decided that we'd love to visit this part of Arizona again even without a specific event drawing us here, we were sad to leave! Thanks Carolyn!
5	We stayed here for the week before we could move into our new house. Quiet, cozy, super clean and pet friendly...with fun western decor and great breakfasts.  We appreciated Carolyn's advice on restaurants, pet care and so many things new to the area needs we had.  This will be our overflow go to place for our visitors.
