5	best crossfit gym... wait best gym period.
5	Supportive staff and everything you need for a great workout. I was just passing through as a guest and happy they could offer a drop-in.
5	My boyfriend and I went for our first class this morning. All through school, I did every sport from gymnastics to softball while he played baseball through school and college. Not as advanced as the others in the class, we started out slow to really learn the skill before the weight. The coach was AWESOME by helping us each one on one until we got comfortable to start going up in weight for the WOD. We will be signing up this coming Monday! Great gym and atmosphere!
