4	A lovely little place that's a welcome change on Leith walk. Selection of booze is good and bartender knew how to make cocktails that weren't on the menu, so you can get a little creative while you get annihilated.Very comfortable seats that invite you to stay for just one more pint. Heard that they also have a lock-in on a weekly basis, can anyone confirm?
4	perect place to warm up with a pint away from the cold weather.  Comfortable & inviting with a good mix of music to boot! Definitely a fan!
3	WIFI.....Nice staff and free wifi with a drink.  Went with the McEwans 70 shilling.  Nutty brown yumminess.
3	One of Leith Walk's many pubs, the Windor Buffet is a wood panelled, traditional boozery with locals glued to the bar. I don't recall the selection of drinks on offer being terrible or spectacular - it was just standard alcoholic options and crisps as far as I can remember. If you need somewhere convenient and inoffensive for a catch up you could do worse than here. It's a perfectly serviceable wee bar, but doesn't hold much in the charm or uniqueness stakes.
