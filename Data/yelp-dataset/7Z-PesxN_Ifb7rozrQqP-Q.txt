2	They started out very nice and helpful when I transferred my prescription to them and after a few months that quickly changed.  They stopped carrying the usual prescrition and they gave me something different and lead me to believe that my prescription was no longer made.  This turend out to be very untrue and I ultimately had to switch to another pharmacy which they did not make an easy process for me.  I will not use them again.
4	I am reviewing this CVS on the basis of their stock.  Each week I get their sale ad and stop by this location to pick up the sale items I need for the week.  They have never been out of stock on anything I have wanted.  My regular CVS that is with 1/2 mile from my house does not carry the stock that this one does.  The cashiers here have been helpful and answered questions.  I use coupons and they have always been accomadating if I had two or more separate transactions I needed to do.  I know these stores don't normally carry a lot of stock but it sure is nice to find the things you need without having to go to ten different stores.
3	Is it just me or is every CVS extremely slow in their business? There are never any people behind the registers so every time I'm here I have to find someone to check me out. Then when I finally do get someone, they are beyond slow. It takes forever to get in and out of there!
