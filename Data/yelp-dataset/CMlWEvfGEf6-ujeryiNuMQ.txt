5	WeGoGamez is the best. I had a birthday party with some of my friends and their kids. Let me say it was a blast. They really made the party!!! Everyone had so much fun playing games on the Wii and Xbox. They had a wide variety of games to play too, everything for kids, teenagers and adults. I had them at the party for a couple hours and it really was endless fun! I continue to follow them to their events so I can play in the tornaments they have!
5	Terrific! We had an end of season baseball team party using this company, and they were just great! All the kids had a great time, the managers were professional, arrived in a timely manner, and managed the games. We could not have been more pleased.I highly recommend WeGoGamez!
5	These guys are great! Had a children's birthday party with them and it was a huge success! The van arrived early to be set up when the kids got here, it was perfect. Even the parents loved it! Would highly recommend!
