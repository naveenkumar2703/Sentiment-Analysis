4	This is my favorite theatre. I'm just bummed they don't offer Pepsi any more. It's a very comfortable, big theatre. It's easy to get to and offers most every popular movie.Bring back the Pepsi!
3	Loved the system they used for the midnight showing of Dark Knight, and I would not be surprised if all theaters start using this method.  They were showing the movie on 8 screens, and had about 3 auditoriums open by 9pm, so people could just walk right in any of them and pick their seat.  No waiting in line!   My main complaint would be the temperature.  I am used to theaters usually being a little on the chilly side, but this one was way warm.  It was also disappointing that there was no pre-show entertainment\ads whatsoever.  It was a black screen up until the previews started.  I imagine this had something to do with the fact that they were busy with showing one movie on 8 screens, but I was quite bored with the black screen and wanted them to show some cool stuff to keep me entertained like Cinemark Theaters does.  Overall the experience was fine but nothing special.
2	So this my least favorite Harkin's Theater.That being said, it's also just a few blocks from our new apartment, so, well, it's kind of stupid for us to drive somewhere else to see a movie.Sigh.Why don't I like this place?1. Too crowded, with far too many preteens. Sorry if that makes me sound like a crabby old man or something, but WTF? Is this where the entire junior highs and high schools of Chandler hang out??? 2. Horrible parking situation3. Bad A/C. Usually, movie theaters are way too cold. This one errs on the other side - I went to see "Tropic Thunder" today in the middle of the afternoon, thinking it would be nice and cold -- and I ended up sweating through the entire movie. It was hot and really stuffy, with no air flow. Ick.
2	I don't need the ticket taker wasting my time, telling me how girly my movie is and how he would never see it because of that fact. I really don't feel the desire to have commentary on my movie viewing habits, thank you very much!Oh, and the parking sucks. There is always five people trying to get into one spot. I hate it.
2	We went here for an escape from the heat- but unfortunately they barely had any A/C on and we only realized this after we had purchased the tickets.  I'd go to any other theatre if your goal is to have a nice cool break from the AZ Summer heat.
4	They would only get three stars because you have to woo me a bit more to get four stars but the toddler and I have been going to the Summer time kid movie thing every Thursday morning where you pay $7 in advance for 10 rerun kids movies (a friends dad had to tell us about it - I'm not one of those moms that intuitively knows where all these kids things are going on at all times). They manage all those kids pretty well and the theater is pretty clean. That alone impresses me.
4	I like the way this location has started to show some one the more indie movies like the recent showing of Winter's Bone. Other than that its a regular multiplex with has everything you would expect so no complaints at all!
5	Babysitting! YEAH! Babysitting at the movies--one of the best ideas ever. Check your little one in while you catch a movie!
5	Best Popcorn....I love the cheese...I love the souvenir cups!
5	Everybody commented that the popcorn is good here. I should say great and cheap too. Once you have a complimentary T-Shirt and a cup. All year round you'll enjoy popcorn and soda without hurting your wallet.
4	Harkins Theatres are just the best theatres in general in my opinion, cheaper tickets than most, student discounts and the incredible cup and shirt deal make for a pretty good experience every time. This one is at a mall in a pretty boring city, so you may very well have some teens in your theatre, but aside from that an all around good place to catch a flick.
5	The Super 8 was awesome. Used my Harkins Cup and 2 T-Shirt today...@ medium popcorn and a coke zero.....It's a beautiful day.
5	You can't beat Harkins!  The $1 refillable cup and the tshirt for popcorn save us 100s of dollars each year, or so I believe!  The parking at the Chandler mall is somewhat of a hassle, but the theater itself is clean, chairs are comfy and the popcorn and sodas are always great.
4	One word: Valet.This place can be a huge nightmare for parking, if you have to circle more than 3-4 times, hit the valet it's so worth the extra money to drop it off and be done with it and actually get to your movie on time. Outside of parking it's a decent facility, the employees are always friendly and the theater seating is like anywhere else. One thing to very wary of, the onset of hormones hanging out on Friday and Saturday night, millions of teens everywhere. Robert Pfeifer
5	Harkins always provides great customer service, the most recent films and reasonable pricing. This is our destination theater when we have girl's night out! The parking is a little hellish sometimes but the theater can't be faulted for that...that blame can be placed with whoever designed the mall parking lot!
5	I very rarely go to the movies, because, i just like to watch them at home. But, every once in while i will go.                                                                    We went on a Saturday night.               Early enough though to get the matinee price which is great. Only $7.00. Parking can be a challenge since you are at the mall, but just give your self extra time and it will be fine. What i really liked is that they did not freeze us out. The temperature was really good. Not too hot and not too cold.   Usually you are so cold at the movies you have to wear jeans with socks and shoes and a sweeter or jacket.  But, this place was perfect. Makes me want to go back,because i was totally comfortable. Plus the seats are really nice. They are swishing and soft and they rock.
3	Overall regular movie experience. I guess it's a given that the plan is not for employees to hurry at the snack bar. I guess they think if we stand there long enough maybe we'll buy more. I hope I have more self control than they think I do.  I did get a hot dog. Nothing great, but good nonetheless. So although it can be expected to wait at the snack counter it still bothers me a little.  Snack bar aside, this was a very regular trip to a regular movie on a regular Sunday afternoon.
2	Out of all the movie theaters i think i have been too in Arizona this is in the bottom three. Why you might ask? Well here let me tell you!1. Teenagers- Summer time is the absolute WORST. All the yelling annoying kids that dress up like they are going to the club and scream at every possible moment during times you don't scream. If you cannot handle the heat stay outta the kitchen stay home with your mommy! (#1 reason i wait til movies come out so i can just rent it for a dollar)2. My boyfriend lost his wallet and his student id so he only has his library card from ASU and they always give him a hard time about that and how it needs a face on it and a actual student id.  I know they are just doing their jobs but i am sorry my boyfriends wallet was stolen give me a break!3. Overall Environment: it is okay not the best but its okay i don't feel at ease at this location as i do some others. Tip: it is kind of a far drive down but thursdays at ultra star they charge 5.75 for tickets! and 3 dollars extra for 3-D! Definitely a nicer theater than Chandler Harkins!
2	I should have followed my instincts and avoided this location for the more calm location on Gilbert & Germann.  We showed up for a late Sat night showing.. walked in to a really packed theater and luckily were able to find seating in the upper section (or un-luckily as you'll see).  Because it was so packed, I got stuck sitting next to Joe Dirt and his trailer-park girlfriend.. who wouldn't stop talking through the movie and making out the whole time... DISgusTING.  Yuk... nothing like watching the Hunger Games to wet kissing and trailer-park PDA right next to you. UfffThe rest of the atmosphere was OK, but this place is so busy (even on a late night showing) that I now know better and will avoid it if I want to a) park easily and b) not wait in line for tickets and c) not deal with such a crowded theater.
5	Our favorite theater, Great location, great staff, always clean and concessions always fresh
5	Great theater, great service wax nostalgia with a midnight movie!
3	Prices are higher than AMC, but pretty good theater
3	The particular theater we were in this day was a bit small.  Screen was small.  Auditorium was small.  It was fine, but not spectacular.  Seats were comfortable, and the arm rests can be raised.  Sound was pretty good.Like other Harkins they have "seasoning" for the popcorn, so you can get a kettlecorn flavor or whatever you want.  That's a nice feature.
4	Great place to go for movies. Conveniently located, decent prices, and we love the $1 refill loyalty cups and the flavorings for popcorn!
4	Went to AZ for a trip and saw a movie in this theater, looks like this is a local chain. I would say that its pretty clean atleast when i went. The screen size is decent and chairs are comfy.
4	I was only visiting the area and wanted to kill some time so I found a movie that was playing.  I must say I was impressed by what I saw!  I love the fact that they offer child care at the movie.  There have been many occaisions in which I would have loved to catch a movie but it wasn't appropriate for the kids to watch and childcare was an issue.  This is also great if you are on vacation and you and the hubby want to catch a flick childfree.  The other thing that I loved was the fact that they have the popcorn seasonings avaiable for you to use.  At our local movie theatre you have to pay $1.50 for a tiny shakable container.
4	Overall - pretty good.  Clean theaters and restrooms, and a well staffed concession.  Don't forget you're going to the mall and parking will be a challenge!  Estimate the time you think you'll need and then double it.  Time passes quickly when driving around in circles with one eye on the clock.
4	Always clean & with the loyalty cup I don't mind buying something at their concession stand
5	Got invited to see a early screening of the movie Planes. Its a great theater they had everything set up really well for the screening. The theater like many other Harkins are clean and have great customer service. I prefer Harkins over any other movie theaters.
4	Best place around to watch a mainstream movie.The prices are reasonable considering the costs movie theaters pay now to lease the prints. Harkins still has a reasonable matinee price and even a movie that starts at 5:00 qualifies as a matinee. The concessions prices are, of course, outrageous. In case you don't know anything about the theater business, this is how they make virtually all of their money. They don't make anything from ticket sales.The theaters are pretty comfortable, and we have always preferred them to AMC because of the reclining chairs. They do a pretty good job cleaning the theaters between shows as well--there is very rarely any visible mess in the theater from the last show.My only complaint is that they really need to get on some schedule of steam cleaning the seats. Maybe they do this already, but they need to do it more often. The seats get pretty funky with spills, stains, etc. after a while.
5	got to see furious 6 here this past weekend. i like harkens theaters because they're comfortable and clean. the quality of the picture and sound is also very good.staff was nice at the box office. the girl taking our ticket after we walked in look bored out of her mind and could learn to smile, but, hey, whatever! haha
5	I've been to many movies at this theater; the most recent one being "Man Of Steel", and as always, had another great experience. their people are always friendly and have a smile on their faces. One thing I really like is their Loyalty Cup. It saves you money on soda in the long run and the refills are $1.50. I always make sure to get a refill for the drive home. They have Coke products, and of course it always has to be Coke Zero for me! I know they have to try to upsell popcorn and candy to the customer,  but I can't do either, being I currently have braces on my teeth, so they won't see those sales out of me for a while. They try their best, but I politely explain to them that I cannot have those items and they understand. 'Man Of Steel" was awesome and I watched the movie in total comfort. I love the chairs at this theater because of how comfortable they are. I am the type of person that once I sit down, I don't move again until the movie is over! The screen is large and the sound quality is great, as well as the picture quality. I saw this movie in 3D, which made it even more exciting, although parts of the 3D made me feel a little queasy since things were moving so fast.Check out a movie at this theater sometime and see what you think.
4	I've been going to this Harkins for years now and I have always had good experiences here. It is an overall very clean theater. The staff does a good job keeping up on housekeeping despite it being very busy on the weekends.Even when busy the ticket lines don't seem to get too long and the cashiers have always been friendly. I have noticed the new release screens are bigger than some of the longer running movies left behind but if you wait a week or so to see a movie you can always get good seats. Concession prices are outrageous but that is the case at any movie theater these days and the $1 refill cup is so worth it. Overall nice theater. Parking is horrible so get there early for a show. I will be back.
4	Accepts student I'd's! 7 dollars instead of 10:)
4	This is my go-to movie theater, mostly because it's very close to my neighborhood.  I lean towards Harkins over AMC for unknown reasons.  This Harkins is in Chandler Fashion, and parking IS bad, as others have mentioned.  If you're there during peak times, choose a spot far away and prepare for a hike; fighting for a closer spot is quite the headache.  Once inside, I've had only good experiences.  The staff is friendly, the lines move quick, and I rarely step on spilled popcorn.  There are 20 screens, so there are always plenty of movie options.  The really popular movies get several screens to allow for start times at frequent intervals.  One thing I appreciate about Harkins is the loyalty cup/shirt option.  For $5, you can get a cup for the current year, and use it to receive $1.50 drink refills every time you bring it.  That's a much better deal than $4-5 each time!  Similarly, the $25 shirt will earn you a free medium popcorn per visit.  If you go to the theater more than 5 times in a year, this is a good deal.  *No, you don't have to wear the shirt each time... show it to customer service when you get your ticket and they'll give you your voucher*
3	This Harkins theater is crazy busy, and is not the most clean of the Harkins chain. As far as consistency goes this looks and feels like all the other Harkins theaters. Due to it's close proximity to the mall it seems to be a popular "hang-out" to a very young crowd. If you don't mind the younger crowds and completely full theaters then this is the movie theater location for you.
5	Love harkins. They are always good with loyalty cups and free popcorn passes. We love to come here for date night and always have a good time.
5	I love the fact that you can check your child into a very fun and safe play area while you go watch a movie. Kids have fun and adults have fun!!! Plus love the loyalty program and the theater is super clean and nice.
4	Harkins theatres are all pretty good, except this one doesn't allow you to put extra butter on your popcorn
1	I don't know how I have this place two stars 2 years ago when they clearly should have been a 1 star the whole time.A lot of you reading my reviews like to harass me for being "harsh" or whatever the F u want to call it. I'm my Personal opinion I call it being honest and blunt. Which I am at all times you can bet your a** anytime any day I will tell you how it is whether you like it or not.  Now let me just say I hate this specific movie theater and only come here because it's closer than others but I'm refusing at this point to come here to watch any movie we have been waiting to see for some time since my boyfriend and I don't normally make it out as much as we used too.  Why do I hate this movie theater again?******TEENAGERS*********I do not miss that stage in my life what so ever.  Annoying as hell and only have gotten worse especially out here in Arizona. I'm sorry but moving out here 5 years ago has brought me to realize how ignorant/racist/stupid/overly prideful arizonians are out here and it's really sickening. I would never raise my children in this state because of the type if people I've seen at this movie theater and it sums it up each and every time mostly during the summer.  Kids constantly kick your chair out here thinking I can be a rude twat waffle and kick this lady's chair and she can't do anything about it because my parents have all the money in the world and I can get away with murder.That's the type of kids I see at this mall and theater every single time. It's awesome. NOT. (I'm totally rolling my eyes probably every other paragraph thinking of all the times I've been here)At least in Northern California you have parents and people who have respect for people and the decency to stop their misbehaved children from ever acting like the idiots we have out here. Just sayin.Like I said this theater blows and will always suck because of all the little teens running around wild in this place. And too many to where if you did complain would be hundreds more waiting to kick the hell out of your chair, yell in your ears, laugh way too much so you can't hear a damn thing or spill food and drinks all over you and not apologize for it either.  How do you like to watch your movies? Maybe not in complete and utter piece but I can tell you I would rather listen to my dog cry like he always does in movies in my ear over all the above listed things at this movie theater. That's for damn sure!*awaits hate mail for being honest**X_x

5	This is THE movie theatre that should get your business. Always clean, great customer service!! AMC is a joke!!!
4	We went on a Saturday evening. They were well staffed so the ticket and concession lines were very short. All the staff new knew their job and worked efficiently. The bathrooms were clean.
4	Always a good time, the theaters are clean and I haven't had a a fellow movie goer do anything obnoxious during a movie here so that's a plus. The sound system is set to a comfortable volume too
5	we enjoyed our movie time on 8/2/14 around 1:00pm.  we were able to purchase our tickets very quickly.  all the registers were busy but the lines were not long for concessions.  the seating, picture and sound quality were great.the only downside and not that harkins has any control over is the parking.  the parking lot is always crazy busy!
4	Ticket line fairly quick. Concession had lots of choices prices average for movie theaters. Great seats. Clean and comfortable.
4	Enjoyed the movie and my amazing movie date here,,,now, lets get better at service at the convenience store. I want to get my snacks in a timely manner. Multi tasking is key!
4	Nice clean theater!  Picture and Sound are of high quality.  Seats are comfortable and they have a huge refreshment area.
4	Turned the car in for a quick oil change and decided to kill the time watching a movie! The ticket line was quick and easy to navigate. The cashier was friendly and we went from being in line to ticket in hand in no time.Once inside the lobby was clean and well-kept. The ticket taker was nice and pointed us in the direction of the theater. We opted to pass on food since we had just eaten, so can't speak to the snack bar area, other than it looked well organized from afar.Theater itself was in good condition and clean. The seats were in good shape, and although we were in a smaller auditorium, the screen was easy to see the movie on without feeling like you were in an uncomfortable position for viewing.Overall: AGood movie watching experience!
4	Never have had a bad experience either in the theater or with customer service.   Personally for me I at least always count on the consistency from Harkins no matter which one you visit experience is always the same.
1	Awful! Floor was so dirty that my shoes almost came off due to sticky substance.Also unruly teenagers have taken over this theater. It is no longer possible to enjoy a movie at this location. This location is merely a babysitting service for parents to drop off their entitled, disrespectful brats. In turn, they ruin everyone else's movie experience.
