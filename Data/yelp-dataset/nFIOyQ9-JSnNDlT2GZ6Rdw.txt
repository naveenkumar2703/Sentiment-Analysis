4	This is a nice little store. Located in the Village Center it makes for a nice addition to the other nice stores.They usually have some cute stuff outside that easily draws you inside for a look. I like the cute kitchen stuff. The best thing is if you don't find something for yourself you will find something for someone! Great stocking stuffers and neat things you could easily put a gift basket together with.Some of the aprons seem overpriced but are very adorable.The store is clean and I have always been greeted without feeling like someone working on commission is stalking me. Parking can be frustrating at times.
4	I was little apprehensive about stopping in this store because of the horrible non treatment I received a couple doors down at Tracy's Watermark, and I was afraid because of the location I might be met with the same kind of boutique snobbery.  Thankfully,  I was wrong.  I was greeted immediately upon entering and took my time browsing.  I love stores like this that are full of beautiful and interesting things to look at.  They have great gift ideas and decorative items to add a unique touch to your home.   Aprons, cook wear, candles, plaques with cute sayings and seasonal items to name a few.  Who doesn't want to buy a Christmas ornament in April? A varied price point although some things I thought were high like the $60 salt and pepper shakers that I could find at TJ Maxx .  The employee working checked on me a couple times and answered the couple questions I had. I bought a couple of things and I will be back.  Tracy's Watermark should get some tips from Thyme in the Kitchen!  They know how to treat customers here!
