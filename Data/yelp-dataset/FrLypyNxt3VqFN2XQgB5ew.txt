2	Staff talk among themselves and ignore customers until you try to get their attention. Not very knowledgable.  Quality of product is questionable -- I have returned many cd's that skip. Sometimes have a great selection. I would never shop by their website because the quality of too questionable, I need to see the disc in person before I buy. Too many bad experiences. But sometimes get music in that I need so I continue to shop there despite poor staff,
4	I'm a total fan of this store. I always find good DVDs and the staff to be very helpful. I only had one bad disc and they exchanged it without a receipt which I thought was super nice.
4	The Beat Goes On is a chain of used CD stores that now also sells used movies and games.The staff here are friendly and know their music, and have always been able to assist me in finding what I want, even when I am not sure exactly what I want.  I often find great hidden gems in their bargain bin... often I have found so many I have purchased more than I wanted!This location is located in the plaza across from Fairview Park Mall with the Canadian Tire.  The selection here is great and I was able to get new CDs here that were sold out everywhere else!
