2	This place is much bigger than it looks from the outside. The selection is quite large and they have many different items and categories of items. I bought a $10 clip on side purse for my lady. But I found a much better quality one at a competitor so I took it back within two weeks with the receipt. They would not give me my money back, only a store credit which is what most stores will give you if you can't prove you bought it there.So don't buy any Christmas gifts, or Birthday gifts or any gifts that you may want to return because these folks won't give you your money back.Shop at one of their many competitors.
5	It's too bad that one crummy review makes these guys look bad. I had a great experience! They have great prices and they do great work. My custom rocker patches came out bad @$$ and I couldn't be happier. I also bought some of their other patches and a shirt too and I love everything I got. They were super helpful when it came to helping me design my patch and they had it done within 24 hours. I will absolutely go back to them in the future!!
5	I've been a customer for about a year now. Most recently I had custom patches made and put on a cut (leather vest). They did a great job! The staff is friendly and professional. They also carry a wide selection of pre-made patches and a great selection of leather biker gear.
5	Happy to have found this place.  The owners are really friendly and super attentive and helpful. I was impressed with how quickly the turn around was for personalized patches. The quality is great and you get them sewed on while you wait. Really good selection and pricing.
