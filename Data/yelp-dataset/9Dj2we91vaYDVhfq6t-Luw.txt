2	Let me say it, I Love subway...not this one. Sadly its the closest one to my apt. Last night though, made me wonder just a bit.  Went with a friend to get a sub. I wasn't hungry, thank Jebus! My friend ordered his sub and when we got to the counter the one employee says to the other: "what's that crawling on the floor" under his breath. My friend and I pretended not to hear as we walk out...I so much wanted to turn around and hear what it was...but I feared I would loose my love for Subway... *sigh* I hope it was just...cricket or something from outside. My friend said the food was great though... I mean their store front was clean, everything looked fresh and tasty...just...can't stop thinking about the thing crawling on the floor...
1	So 1 hour before closing the chairs were already up and the soda machine was already off. I ordered a tuna sandwich and went back home. I have to say that this was the most disgusting sandwich I have ever had. The bread was stale and the tuna was so salty, I ended up drinking a gallon of water. I just threw the sandwich away.
4	My dad is a regular here, couple times a week anyway. He loves the Seafood Sensation and not all SUBWAYS carry it.Tonight we were greeted by Anthony and Tyler. Anthony even recognized my dad as a regular who is normally not here this time of day.Service was great and we are on a clean outdoor patio with pop music in the background.SUBWAY is consistently good and delicious (except tonight they were out of Seafood Sensation).
5	Great service. Very friendly and helpful workers. They got my requests correct and very knowledgeable when I asked questions. My new location.
