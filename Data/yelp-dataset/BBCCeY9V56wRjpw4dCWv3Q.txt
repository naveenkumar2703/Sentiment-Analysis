4	I always find something I didn't know I needed here but had to have! Great selection. Good prices. Clean store with lots of unique finds.
5	What can I say... I truly LOVE this store!  I find it hard to go in here and even though I tell myself I won't next time, I always end up spending $100 +..they have such great stuff!   I like the TJ Maxx solo stores too BUT I prefer the TJ Max/HomeGoods combo stores...TWICE THE FUN! TJ Max has the clothes while HomeGoods has all the cool decor items.  You can find anything in here from Himalayian Salt lamps to pillows from India, mirrors and furniture all at affordable prices... doesn't get better than this!!
