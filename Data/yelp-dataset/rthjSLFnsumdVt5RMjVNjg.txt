1	I had an appointment with her, and less than an hour of my appointment, she calls me and cancels. She said that it was a family issue, which I could understand. The bad part about it was that she didn't even apologize! It's been over two weeks now, and I heard nothing from her. With customer service like that, you might as well kiss your business goodbye sooner or later if you treat people like that!
5	I have done my Reiki 1 & 2 with Amy and I can assure you she is one of the best instructors and practitioners in Las Vegas.  She also conducts one of the largest Reiki circles in Las Vegas.
5	Amy provides heartfelt, intuitive healing with compassion and master skill level.  I find her to be extremely professional and incredibly gifted.  Amy has an authenticity that I search for in a true healer and she looks at the entire picture, - mind, body, soul and spirit - to assist her clients.I am a Reiki Master myself and have experienced many Reiki sessions over the last 18 years.  Amy is at the top of the game, hands down.  I recommend her highly for those experienced with Reiki and to those who are just opening up to the incredible benefits of this healing modality.
