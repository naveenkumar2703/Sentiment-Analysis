5	Highly trained staff that works well together in delivering efficient, personalized care to each patient.  The PT's on staff really get to know you - first as a patient; then as a person, to be able to optimize your recovery time and performance.  Everyone from the front office staff to the PT's are friendly and caring - I really enjoyed my time there.I came away from my rehabilitation process much stronger and in better condition than before I started!  I highly recommend Blankinship Physical Therapy to anyone in need of recovery from a sports, auto or other type of injury.
5	These guys know their stuff!  My husband and I have both been referred there by our doctor, and both came out of it better than we went in(which is what you want from physio, right?) I had a problem with vertigo for two years that went untreated until I came here, and we did some vestibular therapy.  Finally, it is not bothering me anymore, and I can live more normally.If you need physio, give them a shot.  They are professional, caring and more than competent!
5	The staff here and the PTs are excellent! I have been seeing them since 2009 and this year, despite multiple injuries and a very rigorous training schedule, they managed to keep me healthy enough to complete an Ironman race. They are wonderful for injury management and prevention and for rehab after surgery or other injury. I absolutely love this place and they are truly a part of my regular training and fitness to keep me in top competition shape.
