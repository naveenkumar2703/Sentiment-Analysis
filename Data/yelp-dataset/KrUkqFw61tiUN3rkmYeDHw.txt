5	Cute, Unique, Friendly, Fashionable, REASONABLY PRICED and the owner is engaging and helpful.A HIDDEN GEM in Old Town Gilbert !!
2	I have been in this store twice and both times were met with less than stellar customer service. The first time my sister was yelled at for setting a drink down on a table for a moment. The second I was flat out ignored while the owner sat at the register on the phone the entire time talking about very personal things and arguing about debt and store profits. It was very uncomfortable to the point that I chose not to purchase a couple items because I didn't want to interrupt her conversation.It really is too bad because I am all for small businesses opening and thriving in Downtown Gilbert. The store has some cute items(albeit a tad overpriced) that would be tempting if the owner showed some more professionalism.
5	This is a very cute little boutique with affordable priced clothing. Owner is super nice and friendly. I will definitely be coming back to shop again.
3	I love boutique-shopping and prefer to get my clothes from small local boutiques rather than mall shops. I love most of the clothes at Pink Zebra. Definitely on-trend but a little over-priced for tops. I bought a shirt and dress from the clearance. It was about $44 total. Not overly expensive but not really clearance either. Overall I'd go again but this won't be my go-to boutique.
5	This cute little boutique closed beginning of October 2013. The owner said she had to close due to how busy she is with her online business (I think it's called peekaboo lace?). She said she will open Pink Zebra one day each month for business.
