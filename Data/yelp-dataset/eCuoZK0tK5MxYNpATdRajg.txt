3	Let down by the lack of atmosphere even at nighttime as you can't get away from the fact that you're in a department store for your dinner + they seem to have got rid of the little robots that used to wander about the floor when the central Edinburgh site was in Rose Street. The above aside the dining experience was as pleasant as I've experienced in the past and the range of dishes has definitely increased in the last few years. Staff were courteous and chatty and there was very little delay between asking for a specific dish to be made and it appearing before us. Taking advantage of the unlimited miso soup and having just a couple of plates of sushi could see you fill up well for very little. Definitely somewhere else on the list of revisits.
