4	These guys are great!  They were professional, safe and funny too.  They even offered to help get the piano setup in the house.  We highly recommend them for piano moving!
5	I chose these guys to pick up and deliver a piano, which I got a great deal on at a yard sale back in May.  They were able to work with my schedule and fit me in within a couple of days.  Dave was amazing at his expertise on placing the piano on moving wheels, maneuvering, and loading  it.  He took great care and had a professional trailer to load and secure the piano for the drive.  Good communication and expected time frame estitmate.  Their prices were very competitive and I believe they have flat rates based on type of piano in the Phoenix metro area, which is nice to know the cost upfront.
5	These guys moved my baby grand piano last week. They were incredible. They had a custom made piano dolly that made it look easy. They disassembled and reassembled the piano in no time. They were great.
