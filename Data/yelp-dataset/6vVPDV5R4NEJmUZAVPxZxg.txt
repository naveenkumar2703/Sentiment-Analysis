5	We bought a house in September and had a fantastic experience with Lynn Price. We had a house fall through earlier in the year so we worked with Lynn on two houses. I would highly recommend Evergreen Home Loans to anyone buying houses in Las Vegas!
5	Scott Reynolds at Evergreen helped us get the home of our dreams. He and his team were fast, efficient and amazing! I highly recommend Scott and his team at Evergreen.
