3	Diverse Selection of Reasonably Priced Scoops, International Hot Dog selection, Shave Ice & RO Water.The owner has taken the neighborhood pulse, got the cultural mix right, and should succeed where others have not.  If you are one of the many led to believe tap water is toxic stew, your carbon filter can't get the summer swamp taste out of your H2O, or you've got W.C. Fields' water reference, this is a great, inexpensive place for water.  And you know, ice cream always seems to make me thirsty....Personally, I'm a toxic stew fan.
5	Great customer service. 24 different flavors of Thrifty ice cream to choose from choice of waffle or plain cones yum! Clean water source and clean kept areas. EXCELLENT STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS!!!!!
5	Same owner from when he worked at 19th Ave and Indian School. Water is super fresh and the many flavors of ice cream are mouth watering!Great price for a hot dog, too :)Once you become a regular,  the owner will remember your face and, if you have the time, sit down and chat with you. Love this place! 10/ 10
5	Great ice cream! Came to have their special. I will stop more often since they have a good variety of flavors.
5	My husband I are love this place! Great milkshakes! Prices are wonderful. Water is convenient especially if you're filling up a bunch of water jugs. We come here regularly and the owner is sooo nice.
5	Love this place. Awesome food, stellar customer service, and great prices. They just started offering raw juices too. Try the Carrot-Cucumber-Apple-Ginger-Lemon juice combo. You'll thank me later!
4	This place is super dirty but that's my only complaint. The service is great, and the guy who is always there is friendly and super nice. It kind of feels like someplace out of the nineties. The ice cream is super delicious and you can eat like your at a baseball game without having to pay a bunch of money. Fun neighborhood spot to get water and snacks. :)
