2	Friendly Staff but food wasn't great (in fact, japanese teryaki chicken was super soggy....stomach is bubbling right now) and did not compare to Pei Wei's that I've been to. The menu here is very limited. I would suggest taking a chance on another place to eat at this airport.
1	Re: teriyaki chicken - The "chicken" included several wholly inedible chunks, the rice was undercooked, there was not enough sauce, and the "stir-fry" vegetables consisted of raw onion strips and the flavorless bottoms of lettuce leaves. Absolutely horrible. Would give zero stars if possible.
4	Short line wait. Helpful order taker who actually listened to whatbi did not wantbin my spicy chicken. It was hot and spicy hot which I liked but not enough sauce so I had to go back and get more which took 4 minutes-not happy about that part of dinner. In Phoenix options are slim for food and even slimmer for good fast food.  Reasonably priced with a lite beer from Miller for 17 bucks was able to catch mlb game while u was waiting for my flight which was directly across so no rush.
4	Really awesome servers. They're really polite and such. This is usually what customers are lookin for especially on airports and for customers that is on rush.
1	If I can rate this place 0 Star I would. This place is beyond words to describe. The food was terrible, horrific...They don't  know how to cook!The service was not better.Trapping in the airport, you don't have much of a choice but avoid this place if you can!You are warned.
