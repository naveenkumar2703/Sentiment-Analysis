1	This is more a review of the customer service than the alarm responsiveness itself, which has been fine.  There seems to be a disconnect between the sales and the service.  First, my sales rep, David King, will not return my phone calls now that the deal is done.  When we did speak, I told him I was unhappy with the key chain remote I was given in lieu of a second panel for my bedroom.  Initially he was accommodating, telling me he would get me the second panel and I could return the key chain remote.  He toild me he checked with his supervisor and it would be done.  When I called the local office to set ujp an appointment to get the panel, they said I could not get it and they tried to talk me out of it.  In fact, when I explained the reasons for wanting it (my bedroom is upstairs and if I needed to override a window, I would have to go downstairs to do so.  As a senior citizen, I wanted to be able to have them contact paramedics in case of an emergency since I live alone rather than  just have them summon the police via the key chain), I was told the only way to get that panel was to buy one from the company.  The cost? Originally I was told $150, then the price became $299 as they "checked" their rate sheet.  I called my sales rep, David, to tell him of my experience and he promised to talk to his supervisor and get back to me.  That was over a week ago and despite several messages to him, he has not called me back.  Consequently, I got online to research additional panels from the manufacturer of my main panel and found the one I would have gotten from Gaylord on Amazon for $72.00 BRAND NEW!  So much for fair pricing from Gaylord. So what must that panel really cost Gaylord???? What an exorbitant mark-up.           Also, when the system was installed I was given a motion  detector rather than individual window sensors.  This device was supposed to be animal safe for dogs under 80 lbs to not set it off.  I have a Wheaten Terrier that weighs 35 lbs and is 16 years old and relatively inactive.  Apparently he kept setting off the alarm.  When I called the company, rather than come over to try to adjust it, they simply said it won't work with my dog and wanted to sell me 4 more sensors (they would give me 2 for free) at $90 each (which is also available online for $60 each -- so much for fair pricing).  When I complained and said I wouldn't pay more money and reminded them my 3-day right to cancel the contract was not up yet, they finally capitulated and gave me all 6 for free.  I would have preferred the motion sensor.  When I spoke to corporate tech support, they told me they could have tried to adjust it or given me a motion sensor designed for bigger dogs.       The bottom line is once you have passed the initial 3-day right to cancel period, they've got you and there is no recourse for the next 3 years.  I would not recommend this company to anyone considering an alarm system.  All alarm companies do the same thing.  So if you are buying a system, remember It's the customer service that counts.
5	Gaylord Security is one of the most responsible and customer oriented alarm companies out there. I recently needed an alarm system for a small office. Granted not a big job to a large metro alarm company, but they treated me like I was their most important account. Veronica, my sales representative went out of her way to insure that my system was installed properly and that all aspects of the job were to my satisfaction. The pricing and fees were very reasonable and fair. A few months after install I had a small issue with one of the contacts not working, I called Veronica for help. Again she was all over the issue to make sure it was resolved the same day with a follow-up call to confirm satisfaction. This company really cares about service. I have dealt with alarm companies for over 30 plus years, none, and I mean none, will treat you as well as Gaylord ADT security. Ask for Veronica or Andrew when you call, they will make sure that you get the world class service you deserve!
5	Gaylord Security did a great job of installing an alarm system in my new house. I didn't realize all the new technology that has become available since the last time I had an alarm system installed. Their sales rep, Andrew Fox, was very knowledgeable, but not at all pushy, in explaining options such as carbon monoxide detectors, electronic door locks that can give you a record of who has entered your house if you are not there, and can work without a key, etc. After the installation was completed he was very responsive when I called with follow up questions.
5	I had Gaylord security come out last month for a estimate for a new alarm they arrived on time . After going through the estimate we decided to sign and Veronica sign for installation the following day . We are so happy with are new alarm system
