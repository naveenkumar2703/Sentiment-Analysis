1	I couldn't understand a word the doctor said, so I had to keep telling him to repeat himself.... He was trying to charge me $95 for shots! I asked why it was so much. And he said because he was inform me about all the things the dog can get sick of...and for visiting his office... I told him his crazy, it's way too much. So he lowered it to $54. I honestly think he was trying to rip me off. Idk what his deal was but I don't think I will go there again. Oh and it was hella hot in there! No a/c. Just fans.
4	Dr. Francis was my mom's vet before I got out of the house and I've been going to him for over 20 years.  He's nursed my sick shelter foster kitties back to health, done surgery on kitty that had an abscess on her neck/throat, and he even saved a dog I had just acquired a few days prior from Parvo.It is a nice private practice, he doesn't have a bunch of partners, and he even has a low-cost shot clinic.  Appointments are not hard to get and he also allows walk-ins.Yes, his office isn't fancy, but his prices are very affordable and the care he gives is above par.  He is always willing to explain things to me...and I understand him just fine.All vets charge an office visit.  If you expect to pay for just shots without paying for the Doctor's time, go the Animal Foundation's shot clinic and wait around with everyone else.
