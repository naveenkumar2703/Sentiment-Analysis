5	Never had a facial in my long life, but my daughter gifted me one at Katie's.  WOW!  I'm now hooked.  Katie was awesome - gentle and firm at the same time.  And she carefully explained everything to me during the process.  I felt all aglow when she was through.  And my facial and eyebrow waxing was swift and  amazing.  Katie has made me a believer and I'll be a regular from now on.  Thank you, Katie!
5	OMG!!! Have been using Epicuren Skincare Products that Katie sells. I can't believe how wonderful my skin feels and looks. She is a freakin' Genius!!!
5	I am a huge stickler for cleanliness and had been looking for someone that was up to my standards. I was also tired of people getting wax in my hair as they waxed my brows.  So I had been jumping from brow place to brow for a longtime looking for the perfect place. I happened to find Katie on accident while I was using a groupon for a mani/pedi at a salon.  I saw the way she interacted with the other clients in the salon, she asked them questions about their needs and really was listening to them.  I approached her and asked her a few questions and if she could squeeze me in.  She was happy to.  I walked into her work space and was so delighted to see how clean and relaxing her space was.  My brows looked great! I was extremely happy!  Needless to say I have been making the 30 minute drive once a month for the past two years just to see Katie.  I have also gotten my first facial from her and LOVED it.  I highly recommend her for all your skin care needs!
