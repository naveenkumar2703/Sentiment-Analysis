3	This restaurant is not the best in its fast, late-night, -berto, Mexican food genre, but it's just as good as anything else I've had in the 2 months I've been in Phoenix.  It suffers from the same issues I keep running into down here: a little on the bland side, not many "extras" to spruce them up like lime wedges, cilantro, or decent sauce, and, my biggest pet peeve in the valley so far: flaccid ass burritos!  Seriously, if it's not smothered on a plate it's meant to be picked up and it should be able to stand upright when held.  Either pack them fuller or roll them tighter, damn!That said, it has no real minuses that every other taco shop in the Valley doesn't have, thus the average rating.  It primarily stands out for me because it's 24-7 and a close proximity to my house, which is to say that if you have an average taqueria that fits your hours and location already there's probably not a big reason to make a trip for this one.Finally, if I do go back (a certain eventuality) I will probably not be getting the fish burrito.  The fish was okay, but the sauce was too much mayo and not much else.  No cilantro or lime to really break it up.  The boyf's carne asada was better.
