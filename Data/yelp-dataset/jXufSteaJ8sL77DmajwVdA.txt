2	Divas is a small lingerie company that is attached to The Open Door.  You have to walk through The Open Door to get to Divas.  It has some really cute pieces of lingerie, but I wouldn't say they are reasonably priced.  Also, while there is a big inventory for the size of the small space, it isn't displayed terribly creatively, rather just on racks attached to the wall.  The displays at The Open Door are more interesting.
5	Love it! Everytime I go in I want one of everything! Feathers and lace and satin everywhere! Definitely make sure to look everywhere or you may miss something!
5	Becky is very helpful and always gets us what we need on time. Highly recommend stopping by... plus, its locally owned!
