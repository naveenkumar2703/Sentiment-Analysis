5	I actually have not used the Sunglass Hut inside the Fashion Square but the kiosk inside of Macy's.  I have nothing but praise for Sunglass Hut.   I purchased a pair of Vercace's for a pretty penny about a year and a half ago in the Anthem store, but dropped by this kiosk as my glasses looked bent and had that oops, I just sat on them look.  I was afraid I would end up having to buy another pair, as one of the bolts in the lenses appeared to be loose.  This is the second time I've dropped by at this location.  The sales associate gladly adjusted the pair and did it with a precise finesse.  All this at no charge.  These glasses may have cost me more than $200 but between the style, superb service and multi locations at where you can drop by, I would definitely go here again. I'm as good as new, thanks.
4	best selection of glasses i have found with a great return policy! I have been a returning customer for quite a while now and will not shop anywhere else.
5	Thank you Ariel for helping me find the glasses I want!! Even though you didn't stock them you got me to the right location.
