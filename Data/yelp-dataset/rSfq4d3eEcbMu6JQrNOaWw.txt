4	Many years ago when this chain opened it seemed very exotic, so many things one did not see often.Things have evened out over the years where one can find most anything in a variety of stores, yet this store is still fun to shop in when out and about.It is laid out well with prices that are not too out of line. Someone is there to see if they can help and will if you do and they will leave you alone if you don't.If I am at a loss for finding a housewarming gift I can usually find something to add to the pile.So it may not be as exotic as it once was, but it is still a good place to spend a little time and money.
5	This is my favourite Pier 1 Imports location in the Phoenix area, especially for the West Valley... much nicer than the Surprise location, too! The store is a bit larger, the employees are friendly and helpful, they have an excellent selection, and they always have plenty of clearance items! :) Actually, before going to this Pier 1 location, I would've never thought about writing a Yelp review for one... they were all pretty standard and similar to one another. The Goodyear store definitely impressed me, though!
4	They have a little of everything.  When the items on sale on clearance it is a plus!  The employees are super helpful.
5	Pier 1 Imports they are the same every where. when I was a kid I thought it was the coolest place ever. Now I see it for what it really is. Well what it is will be for you to decide. I like it though
4	I don't know if it's the layout, but this feels like the largest Pier 1 I've been in,,,, & I love it, lol. They seem to carry more product, probably because they have room for it. That's actually why I came upon this place! They are the only ones who had the chairs I wanted :D It was a bit crowded and the sales associates were slightly overwhelmed, but they still managed to be attentive and professional. They helped me find everything I needed :) I got the chairs,,,, & a few other little things :D
