3	The wait time is horrific! Other then that, the folks that actually do the blood work are nice and polite. Apparently they now do online appointment reservations. I would highly recommend doing that because this place is always packed since it is near a medical complex.
4	3 words:  Make an appointment! Nice people, 1st poke and efficient once you get behind the door.Of course if you go in the afternoon you'll get right in, but who can fast until 1 or 2 pm?But I saw a man with an appointment come and go quick as a rabbit so that's clearly the way to go.
1	Extremely rude service not only on the phone but in person at this location. DO NOT RECOMMEND. Was told on phone that there was a 45 minute wait and I could get my blood drawn since it was close to closing time for them and I drove to this location and the door was locked and women wouldn't speak to me through the door and just yelled "WE CAN"T HELP YOU WE ARE CLOSED."  I showed up a few minutes past them closing even though they were treating patients still. The woman wasn't even willing to speak to me like a human in order to answer my questions or apologize for giving me incorrect information. She yelled at me outside a locked door and wouldn't open the door.  I stayed outside shocked by this behavior. Not only was I given incorrect information on the phone, but I was treated horribly. I am going to switch my lab needs to LAB CORP. It is probably a blessing in disguise as who knows if getting blood drawn is safe here with the angry and insensitive people they have working there.
