5	Subway is like that slapper friend of yours that you love to death, but don't like to admit to anyone that you're actually friends with. "Where did you go last night?"*cough* *cough* "suwy"."Eh? Where?""Hey, look, someone dropped a fiver".Subway is dark, cheap, and you will leave with loads of drink spilled all over you. Damn this place is fun.
