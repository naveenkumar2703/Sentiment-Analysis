5	I love this Subway...the food is always super fresh, the place is spic and span...the employees are very pleasant and friendly.  They help you with the door, drink lids...and even remember your orders if you are a regular.  It's the best Subway around!
5	Very clean and nice staff.  Probably one of the best locations they have.
5	Subway is Subway and you should have correct expectations when you go there. They offer a variety of what I consider healthy sandwiches compared to other fast food options. If you stick to the daily specials, you can get out of there for under $6 for a 6" sandwich, large drink and chips (or cookies). I like that I get to personally instruct every ingredient that goes on each sandwich. That way, they are always exactly what I want. If you stray from the daily special, the price edges up to where I would consider other options that have premium subs (Jersey Mikes, Jimmy Johns, etc). This is my go-to place for a fast, inexpensive but good workweek lunch. This is my favorite Subway. The owner, Dave, is there every day and the service and food quality reflect that. The employees here are extremely nice & friendly and most of the guys have worked there for many years and you can tell they have fun working there. The store is always very clean.  This is in a busy center so expect the parking to be tight at peak times. Before I moved my office, I ate here at least 3 times a week and usually 4 times and had been going there since before the new center was built and they were in the corner suite of the tired office/retail complex that used to be on this site. Moving our office away from this Subway was a bad thing. Even now when I occasionally drop in there, it is like a reunion. I miss Dave's Subway. It is the best Subway.
