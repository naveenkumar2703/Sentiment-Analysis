4	Clean, friendly, good selections and a great location.
4	I don't shop at Safeway much but when I do go there for a specific item, I always enjoy going into their store. Clean. The deli counter peeps seem to be really nice. Managers are a hoot. Like I said before, I don't shop Safeway often but I do like this one when I need a specific item.
1	Screw these guys. They decide to expand their store and in the process kill a small business. The Mail Vault was closed with 2 days notice to accommodate their expansion. I am all for saving money on food, but I will never spend a dime there after they had shown their true colors. I don't care if its the leasing companies fault, they managed to kill a the type of small business that supports the American economy. If I could post a huge middle finger to this company I would!
5	Small store but the great employees and managers  make it up for it. Wouldn't shop anywhere else!
4	It's a grocery store... I don't know exactly how to review itIt offers the same as most other stores... And as with everything sometimes prices are good and sometimes prices are badIt's close to where I live and convenient
