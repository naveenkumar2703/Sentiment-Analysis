4	They've always been able to get me in, even on freakishly short notice, as when Lumpkin ate half an aloe plant and I panicked. It's not five stars because I think sometimes they recommend over-treatment, like a special diet for her "allergies" ("Live with it, Catkin," I said, and she agreed), but I'd rather they over-treat than under-treat. Also, they have an agreement with the Dane Country Humane Society, so if you adopt a kitty there you get a discount on your first visit. The cats-only atmosphere is nice, too, as I'm not sure Lumpkin's reaction to a pit bull would be pretty.
3	This clinic is very overpriced. I was quoted 1500 dollars for a procedure. I thought this was way too high so I decided to shop around. We found a reputable veterinarian clinic, with no gimmick, and we were quoted just less than 200 dollars. This is a savings of roughly 87 percent. We are now very happy with our new vet. I have nothing negative to say about the quality of care at Cat Care Clinic, as we have been loyal customers for a few years now. I just wish, for the sake of our finances, that we would have thought about shopping around years ago. If money is no object, Cat Care Clinic is great. If you need to pinch pennies however, do a little research. There are veterinary clinics in the area that are just as knowledgable and friendly as Cat Care Clinic, but services can be utilized for a fraction of the cost.
