1	Can't believe I'm the first one to write a review for this pharmacy. The pharmacist/s and staff here are so incredibly rude. I've even spoken with the regional manager, but it did not solve the problem. I have switched to Walgreens at McClintock and Warner and they are wonderful.
2	What is the deal with CVS? They are consistently inconsistent. There are times I find what I need and get checked out in a reasonable amount of time. But for every one time that happens, the nine other times I cannot find what I want (or they are out of it) and the cashier seems to be moving at the speed of turtle. The only reason I keep going is the convenient location and the fact that occasionally they have amazing deals.
3	I don't go frequently. But they are always helpful. Sometimes the Rx is a little slow but that may be due to the drive thru
5	Very professional, friendly and helpful stuff. Thanks.
4	So yeah, this is my neighborhood pharmacy. Booze. Stationery. Hallmark cards. Some stuff that passes for food. And don't forget the pharmacy. Very friendly lady working the front that greets everyone and wishes them a good day when they leave. That's what I like about this place. Old School Mayberry RFD shit that you don't see much of anymore. That old five and dimer spirit. And the pharmacy folks know their stuff too. There's even some candy there in the pharmacy. Eye candy. Enough said. Plenty of parking 'cause it's a mall. Right next to an Autozone, Zipp's, Chase Bank, Jimmy and Joe's Pizzeria.
4	So far haven't had any rude experience's here like someone else did, maybe they have made improvements in that department, they have been very friendly to me, and even called me when I had a blond male moment and forgot my drivers license lol.I normally go to Group Health in Puyallup,WA but had to use CVS for a emergency refill on a prescription I wish we had CVS in Washington State, all we have are Rite Aids and Walgrens (and of course Walmarts and Targets),
