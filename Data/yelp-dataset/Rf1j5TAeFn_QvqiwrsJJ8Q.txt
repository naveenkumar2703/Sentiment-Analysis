5	So, according to Martin's brochure, he does everything and anything having to do with your yard.  Cleanups, sprinklers, monthly services, landscape design, etc etcI called Martin after finding his brochure on my door knob.  That's how I choose my landscaper.My yard was like a jungle.  Overgrown grass, weeds, trees, blah! (I've been out of the country a lot the past few months)Martin and a team of workers came over to my place, and for $100 bucks they took care of EVERYTHING.  And I mean, EVERYTHING!  They even netted my pool clean!  And they emptied a small trash can I forgot about!  So after being thoroughly satisfied with the work, I hired Martin to come out on a bi-monthly basis for $70 per month.  A steal, all things considered, because my yard is big and a painnnnnHooray!
1	Based solely on the previous reviewers good experience with this landscaper, I decided to give him a call. He was very nice on the phone, however he never showed up at my house to take care of my yard. No phone call, nothing. Either his business is so incredibly booming right now, or his phone and vehicle were swallowed up in a space-time vortex. Regardless, he successfully lived up to my expectations regarding landscapers.
1	I guess I had the same experience Shawn did.  I called and got a very nice and courteous person on the phone.  I believe it was Martin.  He told me he would stop by and give me an estimate and that was the last I heard from him - 4 weeks ago.  I guess he wasn't too interested in maintaining my yard.
