2	Had my Mani/Pedi there yesterday.. Just awfulThe Tech  used the file on my nails  that my nail bed bleed and when my Pedi was going on she left the callus solution on to long that made my heel start to bleed.Will not go back even if it  was free.
5	Owners are great.....Mrs. Q and Mr Vu have been doing nails for a long and have great regular clients.........very comfortable setting....chairs are a good massage!......Mr. B does my feet and I am very pleased every time......
1	Worst experience ever!!!! They have printed that polish change is $10, then they charge my card $12!!! Owner starts yelling at me when I questioned charge but it is printed on the wall, told me to never come back, very unprofessional & completely wrong how they treated me for questioning, this treatment made me go off on them!!! Plus the nail tech paint on French manicure is horrible!!!! Less than 1 STAR!!! I paid the $12 but will never go back, don't waste your time money!!
5	I love this place.  I am super picky about my nails. Q does a great job. Vu does too. One of the first things they did was grab a brand new file and buffer andnput it in a ziplock with my name on it.  They use this only on me! Huge fan of that!!  I am a faithful every two weeker. Love, love, LOVE this place!!!!!
