3	Stumbled on this little gem walking around the city.  Gorgeous building.
4	One of the strange things about me is the fact that I'm not religious in the slightest but I totally adore churches. I think its their calmness. Its good to get away from the shoulder barging public in edinburgh (they must mean it, I'm pretty hard to miss) to enjoy the contrast of the peace available in a church.I've been in here a couple of times and it has always impressed. Like most small churches P's&G's is fairly innocuous from the outside. All grey, square and turrety.But inside is quite stunning. A lot money has clearly been spent refurbishing the place. It has all new pine floors and cushioned(!) seats. It looks very modern whilst it retains its original features. The stained glass windows are beautiful and the pipe organ and altar look very stately. Unlike a lot of churches it is warm and bright, all the walls are white which makes the place look a lot less like a cave than other similarly aged churches. The thing with churches is to appreciate them you have to go inside. The banality of the outside makes you think the inside will be the same. What look like plain grey windows come to life with vibrant colours. Definetly one of my favourite artforms, stained glass is disgracefully underused. They have successfully combined the old and the new in an interesting and tasteful way. Pop in if you're near the Playhouse and feel like some peace away from the edinburgerers.
4	Really enjoyed our first full day in the homeland. What better way for me to top it off than a great contemporary worship service with my fellow Scots. A beautiful old Kirk that had been nicely updated, friendly, warm, and alive! Thank you all for a memory I will always treasure!
