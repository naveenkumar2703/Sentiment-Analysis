5	Very professional - friendly staff... I have used Alpha Pest Solutions for over a year now and I am impressed with the results.  Previous pest control companies rarely met my expectations. I have both the interior and exterior of my home serviced so trust in the company and in the product they use is a major concern of mine. Alpha Pest addressed all my concerns and educated me on their product  -- I feel totally comfortable using Alpha Pest and recommending them to anyone looking for a reliable and trustworthy company.
5	We have been using Alpha Pest Control for over a year and have been exceptionally happy with the service. They are great in reminding me when they will be in my area and always responsive. We had bug issues when we were using a different company but we have had no issues since we started working with Alpha Pest Control. I recommend them to anyone I know!
5	Jeff (the owner) is fast, friendly, and provides great service.  The best part is that I haven't seen very many of my worst enemies (scorpions) around.  I signed up for the monthly plan which is about $40 per month.  $40 is a small price to pay for not having to scream like a little girl every time I see a bug.
5	I have been using alpha pest control for approx 5+ years. Jeff is knowledgeable and very reliable. I completely trust him for all our pest needs from our previous home to our new home. Jeff sprays each month for about $45 per month. I gladly pay a monthly fee if it means I don't have extra "guests" in my home. To me, that is money well spent.
5	Great service! Pet friendly. Wonderful people! They were honest about my concern over rodents!! Very happy my husband and I chose this company and we will definitely continue to use use them! :)
