2	Normally when a new Seven Eleven opens, I am like "whoopee!" However, after using the car wash at this Seven Eleven, which is a former City Stop, I am not a :-) camper. When I parked my vehicle in the adjacent Starbucks parking lot, after the car wash, I saw the same bird feces (keeping my review G rated) and finger prints on the roof plus a couple of scratches on the driver's side of my vehicle.  When I write my reviews there has to be substantial evidence for me to rate a business one star. It is a possibility that the scratches could be from a factory paint job flaw on my one year old vehicle. I will very soon visit a body shop with high ratings on Yelp to have this looked at. With that in mind, I will not let these scratches lower my rating from two to one stars.  There is substantial evidence that this car wash did a poor job of cleaning my vehicle. I paid for the $8 car wash which is the mid level car wash that includes polish. Contrary to self service car wahes that I have been to in the past, this one has no sign that illuminates telling the customer that polish or wax is being applied. The car wash also seemed very quick. When I looked at my car after the wash, it does not look much cleaner. If the car wash did a good job it would of taken out the fingerprints and bird feces on the roof. And speaking of bird feces, it is feces that I spent $8 on this car wash.
3	Got gas nothing special. Although there were at least 3 out of order pumps but it didn't seem to impact my wait time. I was in and out quick. The cashier was a little slow and the chips were expensive...really a $1.50 for Doritos?
1	Ever time around 12 or 1 am I go and put gas and I always have the same clerk and she always looks cracked out like she does drugs or something when she's working and she's always rude to everyone
