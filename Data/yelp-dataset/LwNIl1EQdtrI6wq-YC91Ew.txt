5	This clothing store is amazing. It's a very bohemian/hipster/free spirited fashion boutique. By far the best place to shop in Las Vegas. It's located in the Fasion Show Mall on the Strip. A shirt will typically run you around $100 but lasts forever. I receive endless compliments whenever I wear anything Free People. Defineatly check this place out!
3	I love Free People. However, this Vegas location (in the Fashion Show Mall on the Strip) isn't particularly one of my favorites. It's a bit tiny, and the sale section is very, very tiny ( actually, it's down to one rolling clothing rack!). I don't know why, but it's always HOT at this location. I am instantly burning as soon as I walk in. Also - it's weirdly quiet in here way too often. Why don't more people stop by this store? It makes me sad D: I always stop in this place whenever I'm in town, but never get to buy anything. It frustrates me because I would love to find something I want here! Unfortunately, they don't have anything unique - everything they display is something I've seen at two or more other Free People locations. However, this won't stop me from popping in and checking it out - just in case (;
