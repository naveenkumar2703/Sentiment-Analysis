4	Good prices for gas, ice cold drinks, plenty of quick snacks, and easy to get in and out of from Grand Ave.
4	Their coffee selection is awesome!  So many screamers to choose from. You can do hot or iced coffee. They also have frozen cappuccino too.
5	They are ALWAYS the best! They greet you promptly and the place is always clean. They are also one of the few places that have freshly brewed tea ready for you 24 hrs a day. I also appreciate the fact there is usually a cop in the parking lot...it helps make you feel safe when stopping in a shady neighborhood in the middle of the night.
5	I've stopped here for gasoline many times. The price is always reasonable. I always get snacks for the road here also and never have issues with their selections. Today, my daughter left my phone on the counter and we left. About 15 minutes later, 11 miles down the road, we missed the phone. Upon return to Quicktrip, they had found my phone and held it behind the counter until I enquired about it and described it. Thank you for holding lost articles! Glad to have my phone back!
