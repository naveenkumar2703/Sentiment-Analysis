1	This is no longer a Long John Silvers.
2	Well, it's cheap fast food fish.  I've given it a few tries, and really just not worth it even for cheap and fast.  Half of the fish they give you has been sitting in oil and is soggy-oily on the bottom.  Fries are meh.  The hush puppies are really good if done just right, but that's only about 50% of the time.  I doubt I will be back.
5	I love their thick, crispy fish, chicken, fries and hush puppies! Their new fish ciabatta sandwich is now my all time favorite - I won't get a fish sammy from any other fast food restaurant now.
