4	We tried this new place in the Superstition Springs Mall Food Court. Even though we ate close to closing time, all of the food looked very fresh. We enjoyed the beef and lamb gyros as well as the salads and the yellow rice was very nicely seasoned with saffron. We will definitely be going back SOON!
1	This place is Not Good...Not Good at all. The Gyro meat was less than warm and the tzatziki sauce had no flavor. My wife had a greek salad and she thought it was below par. The good things I guess were the french fries and free soda refills. The only person happy was my 9 year old daughter...she ate at Sbarros.
1	Very bad food. Honestly couldn't eat it. Had to go get more lunch elsewhere and ended up tossing most of the food i got at Zita. Chicken was full of fat and cartilidge GROSS! Salad tasted like someone dumped vinegar all over it!
2	Won't be eating here again. The tzatziki sauce was waterey and bland. Should be flavorful and creamy. The service was ok but the food was subpar.
