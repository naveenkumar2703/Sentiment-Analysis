4	EdTwestival was a fantastic event last night. Of course I'm a bit biased but I do think the Yelp Cake Stall stole the show having a prominent location near the stage, gorgeous decorations (Alice in Wonderland theme couldn't have been pulled off better!) and of course stunning cakes. The cakes not only were beautifully decorated but were also scrumptious, and there was a huge selection that was all generously donated. Since all the money raised went to charity to support the Yard's great work, the stall couldn't have been better.The cake stall aside, EdTwestival had lots going on with many fun and different games, stage acts including live bands and comedy, a beer tasting with Harviouston and a large bar serving local beer (Barney's couldn't be more local brewed right at Summerhall). Although the area sometimes looked a bit sparse, many people also enjoyed the sunny evening outside. Hopefully the next EdTwestival will have an even bigger turnout!
4	Great show at last nights #EdTwestival The highlight for me was meeting people who I've been chatting to here on Yelp and also on Twitter.I have to say that the Yelp cake stand was out of this galaxy amazing. Down the rabbit hole and you've found the cakes, oh the cakes! I had 4 maybe 5 different ones throughout the course of the evening and I must admit, better baking you couldn't find. For me, like Tanya L mentioned it stole the show.It looked slightly empty at times as people spilled outside and in to other rooms, but at one point I did a head count and there was well over 90 people there. The room simply was too big which made the crowd seem small.That aside, good chat, beer from local brewers and cake from local guys and gals - what more can a man ask for other than more please!
