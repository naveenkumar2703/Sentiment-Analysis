2	This salon is not a place to get your nails done. The day after getting my nails done they started to chip and look horribly done. They did not paint all the way to the cuticle and told me my nails were ugly.
5	Amazingly friendly , not overly expensive, I have had 0 lifts and breaks since coming here in July. Kid friendly, and always relaxing .. I absolutely love this place..
5	Love love love this place. So clean and so friendly. I would recommend this place to everyone!!!
1	The worst nails ever! I got then done.  They looked nice and then they started falling completely off the next day.  I get nails all the time.  Never had this happen.  Old product I think.  Big waste of time and 45 bucks.
