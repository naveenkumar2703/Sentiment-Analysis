1	Assistants seem like they dont know what they're doing.  They had to do my xrays over and over again coz they cant do it right. Dr. pham is nice but very rough. Had a crown down and it was painful as hell! Did not explain the procedure well and didnt give me other options. Changed my dentist since then and never ever going back!
1	Horrible experience that is going to cost me a lot of money, dr Pham broke my tooth trying to remove a crown , so now i have no option, but to get an implant .Stat away from that dr
5	Dr. Pham and his staff are very professional.  I have only needed a cleaning in the 4 years since we have been using Spectrum but my wife and son are very pleased with the work Dr. Pham performs.  He is always willing to take the time to treat you like a client rather than a mouth.  He will talk current events, academics, and everything else.  He is very personable and a real pleasure to be around.
5	I have a huge phobia of dentists and get extreme anxiety if i have to go (which is why i tolerated this toothache, severe headaches and sensitivity for the past 6 months)...but Dr Pham at Spectrum Dental was awesome! He was very gentle and considerate throughout the entire process.  Always asking how I was doing,  if I needed a break, even told me to tell him if I got hungry during the procedure and he would stop so I could eat. (Never Ever had that happen b4) ...BONUS was having the BEST Assistant Kaitlyn ...Thank you both for making my visit a great one!Very pleased with the atmosphere, each room has a flat screen TV for you to choose what you want to watch.  Everyone was welcoming from the moment I arrived until the second I left.
5	I recently broke a tooth and called Dr. Pham around 4:00 pm.  I explained that I was an hour away and Dr. Pham agreed to stay late.  His work was excellent as usual and he is an overall great guy.
