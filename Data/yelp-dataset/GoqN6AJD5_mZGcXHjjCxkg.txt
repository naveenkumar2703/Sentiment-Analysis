3	Not the most "informed" True Value I've been to. I'll set it up. While in Toronto last spring I discovered a really cool line of Benjamin Moore paints called Affinity. They represent the beauty of nature, but brought indoors in a rich palette that's sophisticated- like me. Long story short you won't find paint chips for Affinity here, BUT they have the ability to look up the color and tint your base. So, my suggestion... do your research and go in knowing exactly what you're looking for. And if you need help, ask me. Ok that might not be your best idea because I don't know a whole lot, BUT it would help to have all your questions answered before you arrive because the paint dude couldn't offer much. Nice guy though! Cashier too!
4	I prefer when I can to shop from a local business.  I have not had luck with their Oregon location but when I am near I do shop this location.  Normally I look for Scott and he hooks me up with what I need.
