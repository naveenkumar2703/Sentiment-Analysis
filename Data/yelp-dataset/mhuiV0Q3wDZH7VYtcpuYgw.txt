5	As good as any other Panda Express.
5	Consistently good. The idea behind Panda Express is simple but ingeniously cunning. I wish I would have thought of the idea. Great tasting Chinese food that's clean, fast and affordable. I love P.E.  !! Make sure you fill out the surveys...free entree.
4	Good Tasty and Fresh. Check out the Sugar Wontons. Mm Those are addicting.
2	Was exceptionally clean! Major problem- when we went in at 11:45 am for lunch- food trays were either empty or half empty- no customers in the store- the dishes that we wanted were not ready and had to make other selections for lunch..probably will not go back- due to the poor planning for lunch crowd!
4	The best Panda Express by far. The location is nice, big and very clean.The staff are very friendly especially Paula!!
5	Very fast & attentive service. All menu items fresh & hot. Samples offered. Ordered 2 different combos: chow mein, mushroom chicken, beef n broccoli; fried rice, orange chicken, Beijing beef. Also spring roll sides with sauce. All good.
5	Quality Service and Cleanliness is great here. The orange chicken is always must!!! I miss the Mandarin Chicken but they have the new Teriyaki which is ok.
5	I love this fastfood restaurant, cos the peoples are nice and pretty fast, and of course Panda always delicious :)
