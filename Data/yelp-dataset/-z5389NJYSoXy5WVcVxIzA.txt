4	Free Coffee Mondays this March.... Yeah!!! Grabbed me an Idea Coffee this morning along with a Flat bread Sandwich & Hashbrowns... All was good... my coffee needed more sugar but we all know How " we" take our coffee is so Personal. So I don't blame'em. No 5 stars just because nothing was WOW about my visit. the staff was nice & wished me a good day oh I know why only 4 stars... they were out of Katsup for my hashbrowns... that tells me management may be lacking just a little. Over all we will be back.
3	This was a decent Dunkin Donuts until it went out of business.
2	Growing up on DD and moving out west, where there is no DD *ahem* near me,  I was excited to see Dunkin Donuts in LV.  This particular kiosk at the outlet mall, was a little of center from the other franchises I've been at. I didnt have any donuts, but I had a coolatta or I thought....It took them a while to even acknowledge me and take my order. Only reason I got the drink is because of a sign the had up at the counter stating the price, I wound up paying $1 more, and it wasnt even like the picture. It had coffee and WHOLE ice cubes...ahh..ok...I didn't argue because I just wanted to parch my thirst in the LV sun...but I was sorely disappointed.
