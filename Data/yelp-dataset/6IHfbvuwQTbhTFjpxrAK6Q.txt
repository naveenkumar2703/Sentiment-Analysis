4	Super Cheap. I was skeptical going in and ended up surprised and wanting to come back again. I was super sore from running 13.1 miles in a half marathon yesterday and was really sore. I got an hour massage for $35. She even used Hot Rocks on my back.  The place is kind of small, nothing special, but good value.
5	Lucky Foot Spa, this word "Lucky" doesn't imply what is in your mind now. LOL.This is a great little place, Great Service, great price without demanding you for the tips. We (two couples) went back twice already during our 3 days stay in Vegas. Awesome, keep up the good work. Michelle, the owner, she is top notch about customer service. For sure we will be back next time in town & I highly recommended to anyone!
5	My wife and I and another couple made an appt this morning for a foot and leg massage. They were on time and from the get go very nice and professional. It was clean and comfortable. The men had female masseuse's and visa versa for the ladies. My buddy and I were impressed with how strong our masseuse's hands were for being so petite! Additionally they were quite experienced and used the right amount of pressure. They worked the upper body as well and the price was very, very reasonable at $20/hr. We enjoyed it so much that we have them each a $10 tip and we plan on returning tomorrow!
1	Worst massage that I have ever had! Literally worst! I never write bad comment on Yelp but this time I really have to. The lady did not even put an effort into it. All she did was just touching my body. I could not feel anything. I even told her twice to please do it stronger but still nothing changed. Will never go there again.
