3	Cool atmosphere and good food, too bad the help doesn't match up.
3	I actually stepped foot on the property of a Ford dealer.  I have driven by this diner for years and had even had a friend recommend it.  When I went in I assumed I would be waited on and took a table.  Nothing happened so I went up to where there was a sign saying "order here".  Still not sure if that was for take out only or not but I got my order in and pretty soon lunch was brought to me.  I had to wait for iced tea to be brewed.  I'll most likely go again to try something else as the food was pretty good and a good value ordering that day's lunch special.
2	It was a very nice surprise to have this at the Sanderson Ford Dealership.  Good thing my service guy mentioned it or I probably wouldn't have known.  I would have just went to sit in the waiting room.  I was starving!CUTE place, employees were not very friendly.  I ordered thie Fiesta Brekfast Burrito-eggs, cheese, potato and bacon.  The egg, cheese and bacon were basically nonexistent.  HOWEVER, it was very hot!  It did seem to take a little longer to make than you'd find at another place who frequently makes burritos.  I wasn't in a hurry. I imagine anyone just going to this diner would be a tad disappointed, but it you have time to pass, it's fine.
