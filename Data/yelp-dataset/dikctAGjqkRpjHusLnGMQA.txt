4	Dr. Rebecca at Renaissance is one of my favorites ever.  I've been going to her for the past month and I cannot believe the improvement in my back pain.  Also, she has Dennis and I getting more exercise, eating better, and sleeping better, too!If you want a great experience with a chiro who will give you the straight facts, go see Dr. Rebecca!  Her prices are super reasonable and she accepts all kinds of insurance.And no, she has not paid me for this endorsement. :)
5	In short, Dr. Carlson and her staff run a top-notch chiropractic practice.Dr. Carlson is very knowledgeable and friendly. She really dug deep to uncover the root cause of my problems and she is always helpful in explaining things to me. Through adjustments, targeted homework assignments, and a lot of encouragement, she's helped steer me back on path to a healthier, much better feeling me.Unlike some other chiropractors I've been to, I feel like Dr Carlson really cares.  She's even called me when I was out of town to check in on my progress and offer support on the phone.Paul and Dr. Carlson's other assistant (forgot her name) are always very friendly and helpful too.
5	Dr. Carlson rocks! She and her staff make every effort to listen, understand, then educate patients how to make chiropractic care work best for them. I really appreciate their insight, positive atmosphere and laughter that makes this practice great.  Check them out - you wil be SO happy you did!Patricia W.
