3	A small sandwich/grill place located in the Green Vally District.  Both the Campfire and the Malibu Melt wrap were good.  The sweet potato fries weren't as good as I had hoped they were going to be.  The side of black beans with cheese had more to be desired.  They also didn't serve soup on this day which was sad since it was cold and raining outside.  A few of the dressings were very good though.  The place is small, clean, and empty.  Not much to impress you with along with not leaving an impressionable memory, but not a bad place to go for lunch.
3	We ate alot of stuff here:  angus burger (ok) w sweet potato fries had an apricot dipping sauce (both good), mambo wrap (fajita steak & rice) w potato chips (yum), fried chix wrap w pot chips (above avg), kids meal of chix strips w fries (both met w approval), blue colored smoothie was acceptable but not strong on flavor.  Prices are average for a sandwich shop.
2	While the place has an original menu, everything they serve ends up tasting the same in my opinion.  Perhaps it is because they offer only 2 bread choices, or in their way of cooking, but I just was not impressed by their sandwiches.  I had their standard fries as well, and they used a seasoning that was not very complimentary to the sauces they served on the side.  I did enjoy the kettle chips that were included with the sandwich, but for nearly $10 a pop, I expect a bit more from a sandwich.
4	I use to love coming here after the GVR pool, but it is no longer open.  There is still one in the Miracle Mile shops in Planet Hollywood.  Ate at that location for the first time yesterday and it was just as good.  I like their angus burger, thai wrap, sweet potato fries, and of course the potato chips. yumm.. their Moonshine is delish as well!
