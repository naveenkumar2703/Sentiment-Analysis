5	We went to the Stool and Dinette Factory looking for replacement swivel parts for our kitchen chairs. Very hard to find because the chairs are pretty old. They had us bring in a chair to review and not only did they know where to get the replacement parts (in which they special ordered for us) they noticed that the chair wheels needed to be replaced on the one we brought in and they changed them out for us for free. Extremely knowledgeable when it comes to chairs and they have a fantastic selection of chairs and tables to choose from. Excellent customer service and I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone.
4	I bought some bar stools from them... It took a long time to get them because of the fabric... now that we have them they look great
2	Called to find a chair I really liked on their website, but the person couldn't find it on her "price sheet" -- so she said that probably meant it was discontinued. Price sheet? Really? In 2014?For the life of me I can't understand why this company is still around without offering ANY prices on their website. Very frustrating shopping experience. I have no desire to visit their store.
