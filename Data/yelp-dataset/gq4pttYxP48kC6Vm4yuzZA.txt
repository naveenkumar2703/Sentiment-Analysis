2	Decent cafe food for fare prices. It's nothing to rave about but it will fill you up.It has updated beautiful decor and food is basic cafeteria food. I've had good steaks made to perfection but fish and chips sux. No flavor.
1	Ok food but very poor service. They do not care. I would not even want to give one star. Not recommend!
4	$5.99 for New York strip steak eggs the way you want them toast and hash browns $0.99 for the biscuits and gravy on the left its only on graveyard with your players card that they have lol oMG special.  This is by far the best breakfast special in town right now with your players card they have specials such as a New York strip steak that was cooked to perfection I like mine medium rare and child on the outside the eggs were over easy the way that I like them fresh sourdough toast with jelly on the side and crispy hash browns but to top it off with the $0.99 gourmet biscuits and gravy n even had a little parsley on top to make it look beautiful
4	Get a players card and you only pay $9.99 per person. The food here was pretty fresh and they have a variety of Mexican, American and I think Italian to choose from. They decor was a little outdated and their service was good too. Be smart and order orange juice on the side. You get free champagne.. So, now you can make your own mimosas!!! Great deal for under ten bucks!! The only thing I didn't like was they had several open tables but, the line was out the door? It didn't make sense! Great place outside the strip to eat at!
