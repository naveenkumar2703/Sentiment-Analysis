5	Was sent here by Matthew at Barber Parlor because he had a 2 hour wait, and I'm glad he did. This location is much more roomy and comfortable and I waited all of five minutes before it was my turn. Bobby cut my hair after a friendly chat about my styling preferences. I haven't had a haircut this good in months after trying several barbers around town.
5	This is the spot to go ryte here... iv been to many barbers and asked for a stright razor cut on the bottom part of my head and no one would do it. Well I found my new place they took care of me with hot towels and all...I will deff be back there every two weeks...gud looking out!
4	Good clean shop.  This is a second location of the Barber Parlor located just down the street at 3rd Ave & McDowell.  Great vibe with all the old photos on the wall and plenty of action movies on TV.  Have been back multiple times because of the great service.  Handy work with clippers and scissor cuts.  The razor neck shave is included.
5	My husband has been having Zakk cut his hair for a couple of years now. Was seeing him at a shop not far from where he is now. Glad he made the move to a more traditional barbershop. Always happy with the cut and glad he takes his time with it every time. Young positive kid.
