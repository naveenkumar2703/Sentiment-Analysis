3	More organized than Trader Joes?  I never knew they were disorganized......  I like Fresh & Easy for their cheap wine selection.  They don't have nearly the selection that Trader Joe's has, from my experiences, but they are good and cheap.  Produce there, is much better than Trader Joe's but for everything else, I'd go to Joe's.
2	This Fresh & Easy is a smaller store in comparison to the others in the city. This location is right in the ghetto of North Las Vegas. Yes I admit I shop here on occassion but it's only for one or two items. I'll go to a different one or Smith's. Thanks.
3	I frequent this F&E because I work in this neighborhood and it's sadly one of the only grocery stores within a 3 mile radius. Literally. It's your typical F&E, pretty well stocked and lots of great lunch selections-hot and cold. They recently discontinued one of my F&E staples, a spicy mac and cheese that hit the spot on days when work was giving me reason to drink and I had to substitute with food. The employees are ok, helpful for the most part but the patrons are the type of people who shouldn't be using the self-checkout system. That's all I'll say about that. They always have discounted wine (I should know) and a decent selection overall. My favorite thing at F&E is their store brand roasted banana gelato. I have a theory that everything can be made better when you roast it and bananas are no exception. Take creamy gelato and mix in a slight hint of banana with a lot of caramelized goodness and you'll have to work really hard not to take out the whole container in one sitting. My other F&E staples include the Italian deli salad, southwest Caesar chicken salad and the buffalo chicken wrap. None of them are extraordinarily good, but do the trick when you need a quick fix for lunch.
