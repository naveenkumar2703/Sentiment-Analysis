3	This is a decent wee local pub. I didn't realise it was right where it is. I've wandered down Bruntsfield many times, and whenever I get to Holy Corner I'd veer right. And yet on the left there's the Hermitage, and pretty big it is too.Comfy sofas, ample seating, beer and wine, gastropub food, decent tunes (Stereophonics "Mr Writer" - I'd totally forgotten how much I love that song!) Plenty of locals enjoying their pint on a Friday night. I'm not sure I'd come out my way for their food, but I'm sure after a long vodkas their nachos wouldn't go a-miss!
3	Big pub on the corner, does its job without a problem. I stopped here for lunch and a blether and was perfectly happy with everything. I ordered a panini and chips for a fiver that filled a hole and had a chinwag on a comfy chesterfield sofa. All A OK. Football was on, which was a bit annoying. But this seems to be a local boozer where all the guys watch the sports while glued to their chairs, so that's fair enough. Decor wise it's all quite modern and airy. Looked nice. Loos were clean. Service was good. Would probably come back here, but not all that inspiring for some reason.
3	Decent pub to pop into for a quiet drink.  Bar staff pleasant and service ok.  Didn't try food but a lot was being served and the place was busy. (Typical pub grub, i.e fish and chips, burgers etc).Mostly male clientele when I visited ...due to football (they have sky sports).All and all a nice place for a quick drink if you are in the area.
2	Went in here for a quick pint as I was walking home from town. Nothing much to add apart from telling you they serve alcohol.Not much of an atmosphere and not much chat from the bar staff. They do have a few comfy couches dotted about the place and it would probably be a lot more chilled out if it wasn't so busy when I went in.If you're after a quick drink on your way out/home or need a starting place for a night out in this area then you can't go wrong, but there are far better pubs in the area.
