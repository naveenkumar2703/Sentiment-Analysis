4	Razmataz, after closing the store on Chandler Blvd Dec 2009, has opened a new store on Ray & Priest in Casa Paloma (Nov 2010). Same home furnishings as their other stores, on the high side, interesting looking but I couldn't find anything I wanted to buy. Interesting if you like to re-live walking through a high-end model home.
1	I will never make another purchase from this company ever again! The company tried to deliver damaged furniture to my home and then gave me the run around about processing a refund when I refused to accept the items. After 5 phone conversations, they agreed to refund me for refusing damaged items. I cannot recommend this to anyone.
1	If I could give this place no stars - I would do it.  I was in the store with my parents trying to help them find an entertainment center.  So we find a couple here we like and we're looking at them - out of nowhere here comes Overzealous Employee.  We're opening the doors and he shouts "THAT ISN'T HOW THE DOORS WORK!" so he takes it upon himself to show us how the doors work while scolding us for trying to open it.  Keeping in mind we're looking at items that cost over $3,000 each.So finally we move to the door but notice a $15 item we like, a doormat.  The doormat on top has a frayed edge so we look to get one from the middle of the pile and here comes Overzealous Employee again - immediately asking us why we can't buy the one on top.  Horrible experience of harassment by a guy with glasses.  We won't ever be going back to this store and I can see why no one is ever buying anything in there.
4	Nice, high end, reasonably priced home furnishings.  Some of the sales people are helpful, others are quite snotty.  Sorry to hear they're going out of business.  Another step in the dumbing-down of AZ.
