2	= = = = = =  DAILY LUNCH BUFFET  = = = = = =This Chinese cafe & buffet is situated in a Safeway shopping center, & seats about 50.  You can order a combo meal from the picture menu, or fill a styrofoam container to go, from the buffet tables, or eat the buffet here, on a styrofoam plate with plastic tableware.  The dining room is really blah, & the host was jumpy & unfriendly.  There's no soup or salad, but there were a few fruit items available among the 30 food choices.  Some of the hot food was greasy, most of the meat was chicken only, & $6 including a soft drink is high compared to the local competition.All in all, even the infamous King Wah a mile west down the street is better, in my opinion.  New China here barely ekes out 2-Stars.Buffet Lunch $6.00, served 10:30 AM to 3 PM, 7 days.
3	I eat at New China about once a month. For $6.50 you get an all-you-can-eat buffet, fruit and a drink. I really like the chicken and broccoli. The pot stickers are unique and tasty and the fried rice is pretty good. I don't care for much else on the menu, but it's a good meal for the price.
1	The lunch buffet is $6.50, but it is awful.  Horrendous Chinese food. I will not be returning.
3	The food isn't that bad...at least they try.
3	Not much to choose from but you only pay 7$ including drink. Noodles are the best dish. Eveything else is ok. Its good for a work time lunch
