5	I had a pic hanging on my refrigerator for over a year! My husband said "lets go, today" and so we did. We walked in and the two guys were super cool. My husband had already had work done there. So he went with his guy and I went with Octavio. He was super great. He explained everything that he was doing. He kept asking me how I was doing. He was very professional but also very calming. My 1st tattoo turned out great. I want another one already! Thanks, Octavio!
5	I had a very good experience with this place. I came here at the recommendation of a friend. The place was clean and they played good music. Rose did my artwork and she did a fantastic job. I will be back.
5	I was going to go to Precious Slut to get my nipples peirced but after alot of back and forth and them seeming really inept and unknowledgeable I called Insane Inks, asked a few questions and went straight there. They were nice, the place was clean, the price was actually on the cheaper side and the guy was understanding and laidback since I am a hug wuss.  =)I'd most definately go back again.  I think they did a great job and I didn't feel pressured or ever like I was in the wrong hands.
