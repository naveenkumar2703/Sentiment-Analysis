1	Horrible service they will come to your house start job and never come back to . They do Kohler repairs and Kohler should lose their number!
5	Aqua Plumbing is the best! I used them for a rental home I manage and not only did they perform the work I asked for, they found some issues that could have been disastrous!  I also just called them on a holiday weekend because my water heater failed.  They were very timely, cleaned up after themselves, and charged me less than the estimate!
5	Aqua Plumbing is a trustworthy resource for all plumbing needs.  They are knowledgeable, responsive, friendly and reasonably priced.  From replacing a water heater to fixing toilet leaks to replacing outdated faucets they get the job done right the first time.
