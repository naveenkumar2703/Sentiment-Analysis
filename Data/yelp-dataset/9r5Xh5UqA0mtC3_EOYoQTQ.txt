4	Nice hot, perfectly made Latte.Great Customer Service, but feels under staffed, resulting in tables not being cleared.However, it is certainly worth 4 Stars.
5	Eh have you ever noticed that its only people with Mac-books that come to Starbucks? I feel left out without mine...
5	Its just too Good... Sadly I'm here way too often. Do i need a life? ;0)
5	V good service with funny and friendly staff.
4	My sweet Starbucks. We have had our ups & downs this year. We have laughed & we have enjoyed some naughty chocolate moments together, but, you've changed. You no longer have my nice iced doughnuts or even a very berry scone & to be honest, your coffee is second best to Costa. Costa now has returned the 'Linzer Biscuit" and your coffee just does not do it anymore. So despite your girl with the perfect smile & bum, I'm leaving you. Thanks for everything & please remember its not me, its you.
4	This is the closest Starbucks to me, 15 mins drive from my hoose.  Easy to get too and situated upstairs from HMV.  The staff are always nice to me and i always get my drink as i asked for!  Plenty of spaces outside for parking or you can catch the No 30 lothian buses right outside the shops!
