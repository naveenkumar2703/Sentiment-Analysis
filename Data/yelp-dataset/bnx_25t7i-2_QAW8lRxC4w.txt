4	Petite Chateau has been in business for eight years and today was the first day I went in to check it out... not sure what took so long, but they are truly a hidden little gem in Arcadia!Situated right next door to Postino in the historic post office building, I'd seen the sign before but it wasn't until today that I went in.  I was impressed with the friendly sales people and even more so with the selection of hip and trendy kids, women's, and men's clothing and accessories - and they carry all kinds of gifts, home goods and furniture too!Designer labels I noticed were Diane Von Furstenburg, Seven, Vince, Ugg, Ella Moss, and Splendid.  I noticed on their website that they carry Barefoot Dreams too.  I was just browsing so I didn't look at prices, but this adorable boutique is worth taking a peak at if you're in the neighborhood!
3	I have only gone here for kids/baby gifts and it's a great place to find that perfect, unique gift. It's really pricey, so be prepared to spend a lot. However, they have complimentary gift wrap and it looks really nice when they're done.
3	I've been in here twice.  Once, to find a gift that I could smuggle on an aircraft for my niece in NY.  I picked up a winter cap that read "milk lover".The second time was to get a Gift Certificate for a friend's new baby.  This was a convenient location and I could always find something relatively inexpensive.  There were many clothes, gifts, and even mens clothes to drop alot of cash on for those that prefer spending.  Personally, I prefer saving.Unfortunately, Petite Chateau closed a few months ago and the space was vacant for awhile.  I've heard that there is now a PR firm in the space.  I'll go investigate soon and report back with a review.
