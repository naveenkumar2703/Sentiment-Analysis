4	Cool place to see old photos and read brief history about Vegas. Not your typical pictures  you see everywhere else. Looks like it will be continually growing and changing so will for sure check out again in the future. Oh and it's FREE (donation box at door).
4	Very cool place to see vintage photos of Las Vegas.  I am born and raised here and I learned a lot.  We went on First Friday and it was really cool, even my 7 year old enjoyed reading about old Las Vegas.  AND ITS FREE!!!
5	Awesome little hole in the wall history museum.  Having lived here for 2 years it's amazing how much information they have about Las Vegas, and seeing everything laid out by decade really blew me away.  Lots of potential for future exhibits, and definitely worth a trip to the Arts District if you want a quick history lesson!
5	Checked this place out on first Friday. It was really well done, as someone who grew up in Vegas it was cool to see somethings familiar and others not as much. It's free everyone should stop by to at least check it out.
5	I met David VanZanten the director of the space earlier this week and was intrigued by the description of this place. It is awesome and the pictures are some I have never seen. This collection is incredible and I think both locals and visitors will enjoy the displays. It is free and self guided but you will leave with a sense of history of Vegas not many have seen. Give it a shot.
