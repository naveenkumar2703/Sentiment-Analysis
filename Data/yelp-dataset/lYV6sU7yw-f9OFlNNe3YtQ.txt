4	I came in here today with a friend who goes to ASU. I am a prospective student and wanted to get some gear. It is SO much cheaper here AND they carry the Victoria's Secret Pink college line too. I bought a cute white American Apparel v-neck with some ASU stuff on it for $12 and a ASU baseball tee for $15. SO much more affordable than the bookstore and the employees were super friendly!
4	I had to stop in here the other day to check on a book and I enjoyed checking out all the ASU gear they have. They have a large selection and very reasonably priced. I may need to buy a few items since I am now an ASU coed.I highly recommend picking up the various student coupon books on campus. I don't recall which book this store has a few coupon in but it is in one of them.I still think it is cheaper to get books online but for all your other ASU needs, I highly recommend. The staff is super nice and helpful!Oh, and as a nice bonus...when I checked out they gave me a free daily planner. Not that I actually use a paper calendar anymore but it was nice anyhow. I will give it to my mom! =)
5	If you are a student looking to buy or sell textbooks go to Student Book Center before anywhere else. From my experience they will give you more for your books than other bookstores in the area. The people who run the store are extremely friendly and personable.
5	Great permanent collections in a manageable space. Robert Rauschenberg pieces are a highlight. Wonderful exhibition of abstract paintings called The Painting Factory was up when we were there.
5	Best place to get the best prices on your textbooks! Right off campus too! They have been in business since 1967 and are super friendly and helpful.  Support Local! They are ASU's only local bookstore! The store on campus got leased out to a national corporation a few years ago...
