4	Since I found Douglas's I've stopped going anywhere else. With Greggs, the "fresh" products actually get shipped in the night before and baked again in the morning, Douglas's take the time to make everything in store.The food may look a little rustic, but that's because it wasn't prepared by a machine and I imagine most people wouldn't be put off once they had a bite. Sausage rolls are incredible in here and are a little cheaper (and bigger) than the rival stores.They also seem to have an endless supply of freshly baked bread that will keep soft for a lot longer than a supermarket loaf.

In this respect it really delivers and you will be pleased with any purchase from here.The prices are also fairly reasonable and better than many of this places competitors on like for like items making this place a winner in terms of choosing the best value for money place to buy your lunch or a quick snack from.My only gripe is that after lunch time, you no longer get the same selection and I know it's about freshness and not wasting items, but in the afternoons you don't get a large amount of choice.
