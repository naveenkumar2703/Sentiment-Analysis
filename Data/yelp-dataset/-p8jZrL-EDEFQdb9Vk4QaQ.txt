5	Great barbers.
4	I have been getting my hair cut here for 12 years.It's super basic.  They have had some Barber turn over - over the years, but they are reliable.  I pretty much say - "a one and a half on the sides blended... a little off the top and tapered in the back."  Then they cut my hair.They still use a straight edge here, too.
4	What ever happened to no-nonsense barber shops?  Thanks to a little Yelp from my friends, I found this spot for a quick haircut on my way to work.Simple old-school spot.  Nothing fancy.  Just a few old guys giving straight up hair cuts for a reasonable price.What I liked the most is that they still break out a little hot shaving cream and the straight razor to clean up the neck and edges.  Then a little hot towel, and off you go!Gotta love preservation of the art!
2	Although this place has the friendliest staff I've encountered at a barber shop, the cut I received was short of okay!  Great friendly atmosphere and some funny barbers to chat with.  Unfortunately, I do not see myself returning due to a not so nice haircut and a price that shocked me when I reached the register to pay.
5	Been coming here since I was a teenager. Great bunch of old folks. Old school barber feel. I would like to see them open earlier on sundays. 10am is too late, imo.
5	These gentlemen are amazing.   My son loves barber shops and when we moved I was worried I would have a hard time finding a new place.   This place is perfect and my son came home very happy with his haircut.
