5	Great company.  Did a great job on my install.  Excellent customer service
5	Had a great experience.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a good deal and great service.  I've used them a few times and will use them again in the future. It's nice to work with a local company instead of some 1-800 number.  Two thumbs up!!
1	Because our TV is still under warranty and they did the installation, I needed to call them to change bad wires that are in the wall.  I have had two appointments and they have not shown up at either.  They just didn't show up either time and no phone calls.  What gives????
