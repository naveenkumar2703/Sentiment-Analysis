5	Eddie Heiner has been filling all my prescription lenses for many years and his commitment to providing the most comprehensive service to ensure that your vision is perfect is unsurpassed. I had a recent eye surgery for removal of a cataract and the implantation of an interocular lens in my right eye. The surgery did not go as planned and my vision was greatly altered. Eddie made my lenses according to my RX and I still couldn't see without a prism being created which caused double vision. At his OWN EXPENSE (granted, I am a great customer with many pairs of glasses that I fill each time my RX changes) he decided to make me another pair of glasses that take the prism into consideration. That is how amazing his commitment to perfection is. I am still in flux with my eyes but that has to do with the surgery and the surgeon. Whether using my own frames or buying them at Eye Options (nice selection, great prices!) the service is equally excellent. I couldn't be more pleased with the service Eddie Heiner has provided me for many years. And BTW, his frame and lens prices are far below those of retail eye glass stores.
5	Great first time experience! Awesome customer service and they are all very helpful and friendly! And cheap!
