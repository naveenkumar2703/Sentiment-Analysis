1	Absolutely horrendous.  This post office will lose your mail (repeatedly), laugh about it to your face, lie about it, blow it off, make it seem like it's your fault and make you wish you had sent it UPS.
1	Avoid this branch! Long lines, very slow!
5	I love the clerks... The waits haven't been to bad for me.. Yes, Xmas time is BAD! But, if you know the right times to go... I never get a line ;] I really DONT like my mail lady tho!
2	Your typical post office.  The lines can get long, but really, I have seen much longer lines at other post offices. I mainly go to this place because I have a P.O. Box there. Tip: to avoid lines when mailing a package, go to on of the independent mail places.  There is a good one up the street on the SW corner of 7th St. and Thunderbird.
3	It's the post office....could the customer service have been better? Absolutely. Could it have been worse? Absolutely. I believe this is a dying bread anyway, unfortunately.
4	I miss using this location after moving away from this area...the staff are helpful and look/act like they want to do a good job for you. It's a post office, so some things they can't control (like the length of the line during lunch when everyone shows up in a hurry), but they do the best they can with the resources they have available!
