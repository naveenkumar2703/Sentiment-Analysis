4	This locale is within walking distance of my apartment complex. The lobby area is nice but I don't go in very much at all. The drive thru is quick and easy.....friendly service.....no hassle ATM'S and considering it is located on the corner of a major thorough fare it is very safe to conduct your outside transactions here. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!
1	My comment is directed at Bank of America in general. I had been banking with them for 15 years, with substantial lines of credit. Of course when times are good, they are your best friend. But when times are tough, they dump you like a bad case of the flu!I know noone will care about this review! We all know the banks in general dont give a hoot about their clients. But at least I will feel better.Of course, that was years ago, and now I am getting back to maklng money - and now I have banks knocking at the door.But I will always remember the treatment they gave - cutting credit lines, closing accounts and suspending credit. All the while while the feds bail them out!So screw you Bank of America!
4	Fast drive-thru window, great location, fast service and clean lobby.  Security guard on the outside of the branch daily during business hours.
3	The service is getting slower, especially during lunch time drive-thru wait time.  Drive-thru is suppose to be faster, yet I'm waiting in line longer than people going into the branch.  Need to fix time or you'll drive people away to another banks.
