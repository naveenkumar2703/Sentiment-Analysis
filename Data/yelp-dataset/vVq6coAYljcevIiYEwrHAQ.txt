3	One I go to when I need my egg McMuffin fix. This location is a little dated. They have been very consistent on my orders. Staff is friendly.
1	Bad store. Absolutely awful drive through. I live not too far from this location and have come to it for food over the years. Each time, over quite some time, I've been horribly disappointed by the drive-up service - today was no exception.  The food is McD's, what more need be said except that this time the burger tasted old and the fries were stale. Its one thing to wait 15 minutes when there are only two cars ahead of you and another to get crappy food once you finally get to the window. I've been here enough times to say with confidence: Avoid this place.
4	This is one of my go-to McDonald's locations.  I'm a regular to this particular McDonald's; enough for me to be recognized by most of the staff and several of the managers.  It's got a clean interior, good prices, and, for the most part, a friendly staff.  I'm not a big fan of most of the food that the McDonald's franchise sells but I go to McDonald's often for their coffee and blended beverages.There are times when someone will get your order wrong or ring you up incorrectly, but they are very quick to resolve any issues.
1	Closed ! Probably to health inspectors .. disgusting inside , out dated , and wear junkies and bums hang out.. been many robberies here..
