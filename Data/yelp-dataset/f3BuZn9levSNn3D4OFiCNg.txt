4	Gotta feed this flu some caffeine
4	This location is the best of the 3-4 I have been to. They never mess up my order and are always friendly. Just wish they stayed open later like other locations instead of closing when the car wash does.
1	I pulled in the Dunkin Donuts so I could get a small coffee to put in my thermal cup for my car.  I asked them for a small cup of decaf.  I was told they were out of small cups and I'd have to buy a medium.   I asked them if they could just give me less coffee in a medium cup and he said no.  I kind of looked at him and said so I have to buy a medium because you're out of small and then throw it out because that much coffee won't fit in my thermos.  He said he was sorry for the inconvenience.   So it's only $.30 more but it was the principal.  I shouldn't have to pay for more coffee than I want only to be throwing it out because they are out of cups.  Shaking head.Patty
