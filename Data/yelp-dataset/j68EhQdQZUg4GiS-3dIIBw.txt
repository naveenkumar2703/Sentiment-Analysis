2	Used to come here quite a lot about ten years ago (the Friday Happy Hour was excellent) and the decor's not changed one iota that I could see in the intervening time. Rather soulless on reflection though it has a few pieces of art to stimulate conversation. Not too warm at this time of year either with its large glass frontage & open passageway to the lobby of The Point hotel. No complaints about the bar service and I've not been asked to drink up at the end of the night so politely for a long time (being in with hotel residents might have influenced that though). Pretty run of the mill selection of drinks on offer. pretty cool professionally graffitied gents toilets.
3	As a rule, I am not a fan of restaurants attached to hotels, such as Monboddos. My problem is that they have a captured clientele, so they often dont put much effort into what they serve. Thankfully, Monboddos also has a supply of non-guest customers which keeps them on thier feet.As a bar, Monboddos is great, a huge range of drinks (including loads of whiskeys) and a relaxed lounge type vibe. Drinks arent cheap, but this didnt matter as when I ordered a G&T my favourate gin went in as standard, rather than a cheaper less tasty one.The restaurant itself is modern and stylish, but has very little atmosphere - making meals feel uncomfortable and awkward. Staff are friendly, but appear to be so under pain of death - its that unnatural. Serving a range of medditeranian and sea food dishes, Monboddo certainly does well on the food front - the dishes are fresh and taste great, if slightly small and expensive.Over all, the food and drinks at Monboddos are good, but atmosphere and price let it down greatly.
