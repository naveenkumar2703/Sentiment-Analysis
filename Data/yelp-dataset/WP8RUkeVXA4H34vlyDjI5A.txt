1	I went to get lunch around 10:26 and there's always some kind of hassle with these people. The rude woman in drive thru said we're not serving lunch right now. But when I went to the same place 3 weeks ago they started serving it at 10:20 WTF ???? I left this dump. What a lousy way to start the day. Cocksuckers !!!
1	They can NEVER get your order right! The staff is rude, but if you call to complain they leave you on hold forever!! Won't waste another dime in this DUMP!
3	Luckily, I beat the rush, because after I ordered, there was a huge line behind me. I was craving chicken nuggets, so I ordered that and some French fries. Chicken nuggets were great, but the fries were unusually salty, limp, and soggy :/. I love the convenience though and the staff was nice and smiling.
