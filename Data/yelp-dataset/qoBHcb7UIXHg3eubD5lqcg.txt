1	We called in the order, but had to pick it up two doors down and pay for it there as well. The lady on the phone said they didn't have green peppers and asked if yellow was ok. We said yes. We got yellow, red and green peppers but no pepperoni, like we asked. And the other cheese pizza was burnt on the bottom. Plus she only gave us three papers plates with two large pizzas!?!  Will not return.
2	Since I was at Lake Las Vegas I was planning on some premium pizza.  Don't get me wrong my calzone was good and filling but I just expected more from the location and the price I paid.  It was also probably one of the cheaper places to eat there so I probably just should have went to a fancier spot
2	As a pizza connoisseur, I've definitely had better. The pizza was typical pay by the slice pizza;  flat and greasy. I just had the slice of pizza, so maybe the other food there is better. The service was slow, but the Lake Las Vegas atmosphere was cool. It was nice that you can eat outside if you want.
1	We ordered our pizza first and somehow the 2 families that came after us got theirs before us..and it was empty when we got here
