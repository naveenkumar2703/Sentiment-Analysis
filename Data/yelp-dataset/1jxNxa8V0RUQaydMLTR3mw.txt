4	If you have labs but no doctors orders to get them done this is a great place. Fast quality service at a decent price. The do the pre fight blood panels for fighters and if you were worried about pre employment panels they can do those too. There wasn't a wait when i went and no need to schedule an appointment
5	THIS LOCATION HAS MOVED TO WASHINGTON AND RAINBOW! Now, onto the review:Best place to go if you dont want to wait for an appointment at your doctor's office. These people will get you in and out super quick, and were incredibly friendly. I also found out that their prices were cheaper than lots of places! My titters test (all 4 ) only cost 189, and I had recently paid 150 for a 2 step TB test, and found that it was only 50 there. I would definitely recommend them if you're in a rush or dont have insurance.
1	If you  want an allergy test done, turn around and go to your doctor. I never had allergies in my life and thought I could find out on my own what caused my reactions. I went to Any LabTest Now because you didn't need a script from your doctor. It's all out-of-pocket. They said their test are very accurate, EVEN IF YOUR TAKING ANTIHISTAMINE. Not knowing any better I took the test which costs $270!The results back in a week, and voila! It tells me NOTHING! Chalk it up as a loss and went to my doc.Staff: Not very knowledgable
