1	Some if the staff VERY Unprofessional and program really doesn't work. We felt like the Management / Owner/staff were a little racist. Program showed no results for us in three months. Went to St Joseph's program and saw results first week. Please do your homework before committing here. We recommend St Joseph's program IT WORKS..
5	Healthy Futures saved my life.I went to here for about 2 years in my late teens for group therapy, nutrition counseling, and individual therapy, because I was unwilling to go inpatient. The staff tailored treatment to suit the needs of each patient, and my treatment plan was different from others, and this was what I needed. Mia was an amazing therapist, striking the perfect balance of keeping me accountable and pushing me, while being empathic and knowing when we needed to back track and focus on not getting worse. She also helped me work through some phobias that were holding me back. I had an eating disorder for 8 years, and I'm happy to say that I've now been recovered for 5 years. I feel comfortable and love my body, and the lessons and skills I learned there have stayed with me, not just in regards to my eating but in all other areas of my life. Plus, I met one of my best friends during my time here. I can't say enough good things about this place.
5	Love them. Great staff, and I'm super lucky to have found them.
