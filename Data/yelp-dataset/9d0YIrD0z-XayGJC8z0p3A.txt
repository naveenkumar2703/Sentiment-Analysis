3	Since I'm not a fan of overpriced flowers for weddings I and my bridesmaids got together, had a party and made our own bouquets with flowers purchased from Aj's.  While pricey, the blooms were lovely and mainly unblemished or broken so in the end it was well worth it.  In all I spent 110 dollars on flowers for myself and 3 bridesmaids and still had a few left over to set around the house.  We had a small wedding and if you are doing table settings, a florist would probably be wise if only to save some sanity as the day draws near, but for small weddings this was an ideal solution.
3	I *LOVE* the floral arraignments here at AJ's Floral... but my god they are super expensive! I guess you get what you pay for... they are beautiful. They have a GREAT variety for a super market (high end super market). But if budget is an issue... there is a Safeway literally across the street with a nice floral department for much less money,.
4	Great selection of flowers here and they wrap them up nicely. This is my go to spot when I need flowers for someone or want them for my place. The prices on their bouquets are reasonable too.
