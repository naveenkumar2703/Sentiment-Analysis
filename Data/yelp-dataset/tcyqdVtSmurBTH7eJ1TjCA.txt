5	These folks are great. They are just down the street from us, and we go there all the time.  Whether we dine in or get take-out, they always take great care of us. Our meals are almost always right. Customer service is excellent. And they are really very friendly and accommodating to our numerous food allergies. Thank you!
1	My wife & I entered at the bar around 8:15pm on a Wednesday night. No bartender in sight. Just two other customers across from us.  Watched as several employees wandered in, discussed their personal lives, did not even look in our direction.  My wife left for a visit to the bathroom, which was clean (unlike the bar which was covered in crumbs and easily ranked a 7-8 on the nasty & sticky scale).  When she returned, we left, ungreeted, hungry, thirsty, and just about completely cured of our long time love for a restaurant chain that, at least at all of its remaining locations in Vegas, has lost all it's appeal.
4	The food is so delicious! And the servers in the bar are so nice!
3	It would have been nice to get alcohol in our margaritas. Had the chicken fajitas.  Very bad. If its not a Mexican restaurant don't order mexican food. Very true here.  The staff were very attentive.
5	Needed a casual place for a dinner meeting had the grilled  chicken salad in the bar seating area new cool iPads at table allow you to order immediately click for refills add extra items estimate food arrival time and pay your check had a great time great staff way to go I'll be back for sure !!!
1	My husband and I had dinner at this location one time. I ordered a hamburger and it came raw. The outside was cooked and the inside was literally raw. I hate sending food back and very rarely will. Big mistake, I tried to take a second bite and almost threw up. I sent it back. The manager did come out to personally apologize. The second burger came cooked but at that point I felt sick and no longer had an appetite. We won't be going back.
