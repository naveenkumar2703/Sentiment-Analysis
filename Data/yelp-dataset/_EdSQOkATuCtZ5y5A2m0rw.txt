3	This particular Arby's is just average....it has a nice staff....and the food is just average as well. Right now there is a promotion going on for there new chicken salad sandwich....and it is just average as well. If you like Roast beef.....and I don't....then this of course is the place for you. The deals they have on roast beef sandwiches are unmatched....but that is about all they can boast about. The curly fries are a must because the regular french fries are again just average. So  I guess I am saying if your looking for average food then come on over to this locale......if not move on but continue to Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
4	A fast food joint I don't get to frequent very often.  Though it's a bit pricey for "fast food", I'd have to say the quality is pretty delish.  I love their roast beef sandwiches smothered in Arby Sauce and Horsey Sauce.  I definitely miss the days of 5 for $5 sandwiches.  The sandwiches have definitely gotten smaller than back in the days, but still taste the same.  Their potato cakes are so crunchy and perfectly cooked.  I'd choose those over the curly fries.  Until we meet again...probably in another year.
