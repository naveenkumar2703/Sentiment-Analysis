1	Not sure about Dr. King but the receptionist Micah was one of the rudest people I have ever spoken with
5	I have been with Dr. King for over a year and a half after many failed attempts to find the perfect primary care physician. So many times you wait forever to see the doctor and then they spend 10 minutes with you and nothing gets resolved. Dr King always takes extra time with me and all of her patients that I have met.The staff is so nice and accommodating. I have been able to get same day appointments, my labs come back quickly and my over all health has improved greatly. Dr. King helped me implement a diet and exercise program that was easy to follow and helped me not only lose weight but lower my blood pressure and cholesterol! All of this without prescriptions which I am so happy about.Dr. King takes a holistic approach to medicine. She is always available and a great listener, I am so happy that she has allowed me to be a part of her practice.
1	Can't agree more with the comment above. The medical asst was really unprofessional.  If you don't know don't guess, she gave me uncertain medical information on behalf of dr.  I got my annual check long time ago, and I didn't get my check result until 2months later.  Will never suggest anyone I know to go there.  You feel negative and stress with them!
