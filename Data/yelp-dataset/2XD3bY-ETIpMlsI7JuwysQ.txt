4	Great student art gallery with a good variety and ever changing selection.  Reasonable prices round out the deal that makes it the place to go.  Go see for yourself you won't be disappointed
2	Here's the thing about Art-One. They have good art, but  horrible customer service. I last stopped in there when I was on my way (and early) to a job interview at Lisa Sette Gallery. I was excited because Jon Read, an artist I knew of from Mesa- has items in the window. I spent a while looking at them, and then went in to see what they were names and how much they were. The two guys dressed in black continued to talk, didn't acknowledge me, and seemed to be annoyed. What a horrible impression.
5	I'm pretty sure a majority of people that work here are volunteers, so the customer service is going to constantly change. I've met the same guy in there 3 times now and he's always super attentive and nice. The first time we went in there he gave us bottled water! My husband played a show here a few weeks ago and he went out of his way to bring me a chair - he also had his bizarre cat do some tricks for us! The art is wonderful and the prices are really affordable. I love that it's student work, fresh and modern and really intriguing. Honestly, it's the only gallery in old town that I could spend more than 20 minutes in.
5	Art One mostly showcases the art of students, mostly high school and college students.  It also has the most interesting art on Marshall Way.  It's definitely the place on the block that is willing to take the most risks.  The art is also affordable enough that regular people are able to buy it.  I highly recommend stopping in here, you're sure to see something that makes your day.  There's also a hairless kitty that lives there, if that's your thing.
