4	The first time I went to Coppers was for a 50cent beer night. It was mayhem! So crowded that It was impossible to get a drink. I never gave a thought to this place. Then again I tried this place to get wings. I was told by someone who came into my work that Coppers has the best wings. Being a wing freak I had to go. My boss who is also a wing guy went with me. We are very critical with out food, being chef's and all we are super picky I guess. The wings were crispy, tangy and delicious! If I were to picture perfect wings this would be it! As we tried other items nothing come out as good as the wings. I can truly say this place lives up to the Best Wings in the North Valley!!!!Everytime we went we never had any problems finding a seat or a crazy crowd, seems as if things died down a bit but the Karaoke nights gets annoying so watch out.
3	Typical dumpy yet fairly clean little sports bar in a strip mall setting. Get your tires changed next door at Discount Tire and grab a few heinekins while you wait. Beware though, they call it coppers because it is owned and frequented by Cops and for some reason there are a lot of people missing limbs that frequent the place.?. hum. ho.
