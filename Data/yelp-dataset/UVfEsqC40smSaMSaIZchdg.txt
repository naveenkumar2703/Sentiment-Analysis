1	Are you out kidding me? This place is a dump. Worst Thai food in town if you even want to call it that. The complimentary egg drop soup was flavorless. I ordered the chicken chili mint lunch special with a 5 on the heat scale. It tasted like no heat at all. I could have made that dish at home! Eggroll was dripping with grease. I highly DON'T recommend this place.
4	I live in the neighborhood and have been a lover of Thai food for over thirty years. I've lived in San Francisco, LA and New York and been to a million top notch Thai food places. I was excited to try this place as soon as it opened. It hasn't been open long just since last month, so I find the first review a little hard to believe as legit. Even so I was very happy with the food and the service. I had the Red Curry with Tofu and thought it was a soothing delicious meal. The servings were hot and large. I could only eat half.The atmosphere is down to earth. It's clean and the service was quick and considerate. My partner had the Thai tea and loved it. She had the Pad Thia and I can't remember what else but she loved it too.It's not trying to be something it's not. Come on were talking the corner of Bonanza and Eastern. But you know what, this neighborhood is coming up. I think it has a good chance of coming up with it.My hope is that the tea service could be stepped up. I like a hot jasmine tea with my meal. Please make it hot next time. :)
