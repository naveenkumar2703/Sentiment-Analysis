2	Togo's is not the place to go if you want a veggie sub.  I can't comment on the quality of the meats but their vegetarian options are boring.  What's the point of a cheddar cheese sub if they can't toast it?!?  Oh, the humanity!
5	One of the best sandwich shops I've ever been to.The sandwiches are actually as big as advertised, you can barely fit your mouth around them!  I highly recommend the Turkey and Avocado.  Friendly staff, a little pricey, but well worth it!
5	Togo's is the best for Sub's as for Vegetarian. When I want an opinion about Veggies I will ask a rabbit!
