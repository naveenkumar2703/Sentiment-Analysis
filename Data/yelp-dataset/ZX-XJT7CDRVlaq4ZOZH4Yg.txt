5	Mr. KnifeGuy(owned by Brent) is the best knife store I have ever been to.  The shop is located inside FoodWise which is another post all by itself.  The knife counter is in the back right corner of FoodWise and has every kind of knife you would ever want. I have placed custom orders and purchased several knives from here and every one has been of superb quality. Brent is also extremely knowledgable, so if you don't know what kind of knife you need, but you know what you need it to do, go in and ask Brent and he will be able to recommend several options for you, which will be specific to your needs and price range.  He carries many brands including Benchmade, Mantis, Kershaw and Microtech which have become my favorite brands of high quality knives, and a plethora of other brands.  Brent's extensive knowledge will amaze you, and don't feel bad if you need clarification when he starts talking about the different grades of knife steel. Visit Mr.KnifeGuy for all of you knife needs; from tactical to cooking you will find anything that you need.
5	If your looking for a retail shop that sells high end knives at a normal price(comparable to the internet and not MSRP) then this is your KNIFE GUY. He is friendly and seemed knowledgeable about his merchandise. There is no other place that I know of in town that is comparable. He however, does not carry many cheap knives if you go see him be prepared to spend at least $100 for a pretty nice knife.
5	This guy knows his knives. Top end stuff. Some very unusual and limited edition goodies. He gave me some very good deals on some great knives. He ships anywhere and was a pleasure to deal with. I bought 5 today and will be back.
