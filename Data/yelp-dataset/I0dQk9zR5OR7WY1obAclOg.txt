5	I've used Erik"s catering for numerous events large and small, formal and casual. What I love about Erik's catering is the no matter whether I have a large or smaller budget in mind for an event, he can always provide me with a beautiful presentation and a great meal.  Always professional. I've done several different themes representing all different types of food. Always with great results and rave reviews from my guests.  I highly recommend them!  P.S.  they also do doggie cupcakes and parties!
5	I have used Erik's Catering for numerous events, my anniversary party, graduation party and I have also used him for a small dinner party I had.  I met Erik when I attended San Gennaro.  He has great food and presentation.  I would love for Erik to be my personal chef.  GREAT, GREAT SERVICE AND PRESENTATION.Joyce A.
