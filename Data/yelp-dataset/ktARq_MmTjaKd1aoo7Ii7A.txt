3	This square is not a particularly interesting square. I've sat here for the sole purpose of being able to eat my baked potato (from the Baked Potato Shop) in peace. But it's loud, sandwiched between the Royal Mile, North Bridge and the Cowgate. It's the meeting point of many organised protests (that I've been to anyway), and is the home of the Tron Kirk. Hunter Square is also the home of the kids we call the Cockburn kids. Because they hang out between Hunter Square and Cockburn Street. They're young 15 year old goths, who rebel on the kirk's steps. Because. Because they can. Fag's hanging out the side of their mouths, black make-up lining their eyes, they should have a review unto themselves.

3	Resting place to eat your lunch or take a break from your day out and about in Edinburgh. Shoehorned in between the Bridges, Cowgate and the Royal Mile, you're not in the least bit likely to get any peace doing so but it is a resting place all the same.Hunters Square is home of the Tron Kirk and some of the scariest alt kids you have ever seen. I don't like to use "goth" as I had long hair, trench coat, baggy trousers and huge boots as a teen and one of my favourite groups was still the Bee Gees but this square is the home to some very scary children.Grab a seat, enjoy.
