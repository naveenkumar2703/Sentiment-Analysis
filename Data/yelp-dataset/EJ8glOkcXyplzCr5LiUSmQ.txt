4	I come here often..
4	This place is right across the street from where I work and therefore is very convenient. Good service, nice sandwich artists and good atmosphere.
3	Meh...it's Subway! I like it better than Port a Subs or Jersey Mikes. I usually only get Subway when we're in the middle of no where and it's either this or McDonalds or we are getting on a plane and we have no time or better options. But there is one located a block from work, I was in need of lunch and was also being lazy at the time.The service was quick for lunch time and the staff was friendly and efficient. The shop was clean. And 5$ for a foot long is pretty damn cheap.
4	I have a love / hate relationship with subway. Sometimes the food is good, and sometimes...... it's meeeh. But what can I expect?I walked in , and there was only one girl working, (around 1230). My sandwich was madejust right, and the girl didn't give me attitude when I asked for all sauces on the side....Sothat it wouldn't get soggy. The only thing that looks like it might get negative, is when morepeople were coming in. i could tell the girl was becoming overwhelmed.
2	Came in for the first time in a long time. Kind of disappionted, condiments fell out of both halves of the footlong my son and i split and the gal behind the conter started giggling when she was corrected on the sandwhich after putting chicken on it. I think it will be a while before i return to this location again.
5	Best Subway ever,  the absolute best customer service.   The sandwiches are made perfect everytime!!!!
4	It's a Subway. Nothing more, nothing less. Nice that it's open 24 hours. Staff is always friendly. Never had a bad experience.
