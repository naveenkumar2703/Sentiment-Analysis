1	Clerks will lie to you and deny replacement warranty coverage.  Signed up for one plan, had paperwork in hand, and was told that wasn't actually what I signed up for!  Horrible service!  Can't wait to get out of this worthless contract!  When asked to get a phone number for manager had to wait 15 minutes to get the card,  Never using Verizon again!
