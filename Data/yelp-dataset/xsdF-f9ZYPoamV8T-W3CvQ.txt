4	Lacking great therapists.  Go to North Durango location.
5	I absolutely LOVE this place!  My only complaint would be to make sure you cancel at least a day before or you will get charged anyway.  I woke up one morning with a high fever and called to cancel, they said they would waive the charge just this once, but I was charged anyway.  So now if I even THINK I might not feel well I call and cancel my appointment.  Tim is my massage therapist and he does awesome work!  I could barely move my shoulders before going to see him and I am in WAY better shape now!  If you love massage, this is the place for you!
5	I had a great massage today by William. I feel so awesome right now that I was compelled to write him a review as soon as I got home. He got rid of all my knots without making me cry! I have a very high stress job (I own my own business - 'nuff said) and I always feel like my shoulders are at my ears. Right now they are right where they should be. He was also very conscious of keeping all my lady parts covered. That is super important for women getting massages by men. Trust me, I've had massages by other male therapists and I sometimes felt that they were peeking at my who-ha. Needless to say I never returned to those places. I will definitely be returning here. The staff was very accommodating also!
5	Great service and schedules! Geneva is wonderful and very knowledgable! Eli the manager cares and makes sure you are getting the experience you are paying for! Very happy that I signed up!
