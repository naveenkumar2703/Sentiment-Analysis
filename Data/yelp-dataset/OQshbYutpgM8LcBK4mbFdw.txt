3	Indigo Joe's is a good place to relax after work or take the family on the weekend. They have several very large TVs and a smattering of smaller ones, most set to different sports venues. The burgers and wings were good but nothing special. Service was a little slow when we were there but I think the girls were doing their best, as they were very busy.
3	I got like a spicy chicken sandwich and fries.  The fries were actually very well seasoned and delicious.  The burger was great except for some parts of the chicken that was a little bland.  The prices were reasonable and most of the customers in my party were satisfied.  This is my first experience dining in Arizona, so I don't have much of a comparison, so I will give it an average rating.
4	Great place to watch sports with good food. Try the Hickory Bourbon wings they are amazing. Great staff too.
