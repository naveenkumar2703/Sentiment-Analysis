4	YUM!!!  Pizza and Calzones (without all that Ricotta)!!We really do enjoy Rosatti's, their thin crust is crispy and full of flavor.  Their Calzones are REALLY good and again none of that "other" cheese to overwhelm you.  Good quality products are certainly in place and we keep coming back for more!**This is a take out / delivery only location so keep that in mind**
2	Too bad Rosatti's has jacked up their prices... I just cancelled the order to go with NYPD as even before coupon they are a much better value and NYPD is a superior pizza!
4	If you haven't tried Rosati's you are missing out! When I came here I had a meatball sub and it was the best I've had thus far. The meatballs were so tender and the bread was perfect, not too crisp or too soft to leave you with a soggy mess!I finally brought my boyfriend here and he loved it! Call in your order ahead of time so it will be ready by the time you come or you'll have to wait 10-15 minutes. There are only counters inside and if you can bear the heat by now there are tables outside. It's not a sit down and eat place. If you're looking for authentic Italian give Rosati's a try!
2	This Rosati's pizza lacked the quality I've had at other Rosati's pizza. They overcooked it and it had a slightly charred flavor to it, both times I went to this place. The customer service was poor both times because I felt rushed and the employees did not care to help me and seemed like they would rather be someplace else. I'm not saying all Rosati's are bad because I also frequent the Rosati's at 28th and Thunderbird, and it is fantastic compared to this one (Both in customer service and food).
5	The GOODYEAR Rosati's has always been very good to us!  I think their menu has changed over the past 6 years or so, but the pizza remains outstanding!  We normally went for the thin crust combo - very basic, very excellent crust!  The toppings are so good that it doesn't need a ton of crust to make up for it.I have yet to try their deep dish or Chicago style pie but it's on the list of "to try" items.  I'm working in the middle of Phoenix right now, so I'll be trying the location close to the airport.  But when we lived in Goodyear, Rosati's was as good as it gets!  Memorable enough that I always get a pizza from here when I get the chance to stop by Goodyear for old times' sake!**UPDATE** I have since had their deep dish Chicago pie twice and it is unbelievable - count yourself lucky, Phoenix, to have access to this type of pizza in your area - it's a rare treat!
5	I have some friends that live in the Phoenix area that I visit every year.  They brought this for take out and personally, I think it's the best pizza.  I realize everyone has their own tastes but for me this does it.  Great taste.  Thick pieces.  Fantastic.
