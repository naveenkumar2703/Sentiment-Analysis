5	We have several pieces from the Land of Ahhs in our home and every time I walk in I see something that I can easily use to accessorize without breaking the bank. I love this store!
3	Popped in on the way to Bed, Bath & Beyond and I'm so glad I did! This is a cute place.Cute does not mean small. The space seemed to go on and on!If you're in the need for furniture - any kind of furniture - the Land of Ahhs Consignments offers quite a bit. Couches, bedroom sets, tables, chairs, artwork, you name it I saw a smattering of it here. Items appeared almost new and smelled freshly cleaned.Alas, I struck out. I was looking for something on the smaller side to fit my corner dining area. However, I was told the inventory is regularly refreshed by the (incredibly upbeat and) helpful staff.If this gem was in my neck of the woods I'd pop in *all* the time! This is a definite recommend!
4	I am naturally attracted to the words "consignment" and "thrift store."  As soon as my eyes laid on the Land of Ahhs Consignment, my feet automatically sped up towards the door. I liked everything I saw.  It's not called the Land of Ahhs for nothing.  The items in there are a cross between classy and eccentric.  But nonetheless most of the items are made for great conversation pieces for your home.  I didn't buy anything cause some of the prices were a bit steep for my pocketbook but, man, I know I will be back for something special.
1	Prices are not consignment store prices. The prices are way high. Furniture is ok but not a bargain by any means.
