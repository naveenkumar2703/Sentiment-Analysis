4	I prefer Costa Coffee, so much richer than Starbucks and I like the fact that they do pay UK Tax as opposed to the dodgy Starbucks! But alas, I do not like any of their Cakes, they have stopped doing everything I like, so its a tin of ground Coffee to take home and probably Starbucks next time...
3	Handy space on Musselburgh High Street. I'll admit - anything that isn't a charity shop that appears these days I see as a blessing. I'm not really bothered by 'chain stores are destroying high streets!' - online shopping is. I tell you what - every shop that tries to come in and invigorate our lonesome small town streets is a joy and a blessing. Costa does what it says on the tin - it has a great location in the middle of the high street, and a pleasant place to stop for a quick drink or a chat with friends. There are other options of course, but I'm all about options, and am glad Costa has been added to the list.
4	Like Catriona C says it's a handy spot on Mussleburgh High street and it's a happy welcome too.  Hoping that it builds up a coffee scene in Mussleburgh as it needs less bargain stores and more good shops. The staff are very cheery which makes a difference in chain.  often you find staff unhappy and fed up.  we had panini's and I tried the new hot apple spice drink which lovely warm and very sweet!  Perhaps next time I will ask for less of the syrup base. Mum had coffee, which went fast as always!Plenty of seating outside and in.  The main Toilets are upstairs and there are a few steps!one of the nicer costas!
