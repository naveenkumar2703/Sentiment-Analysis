3	I am NOT  fan of Chase bank.  My personal accounts are elsewhere but I assist someone with their Chase account and occasionally have to deal with them.This particular location is fast, and friendly.  I've run into some ridiculous bureaucratic stupidity here but in less than 2 minutes had a manager override the nonsense.  If you must bank with Chase, you'll do OK here.
4	This is a good location for me on occassion. At times i need to pop in and make a deposit or withdrawl. Lots of parking in the lot and you can access it from Thomas or 7th Ave.  They are very friendly and try to help you as quick as they can. They also have a drive thru. but at times i find it is quicker just to go inside.
1	What ever happen to customer service?  It seems that this term and banking (at least with Chase) are not allowed to exist within their walls  I had a deposit eaten by the ATM on Sunday march 4 and today Tuesday the Acting manager and CSR told me they only count the machine once a week on Thursdays. Kinda makes you scratch your head and go hummmm What else can I say?
5	Jose C. gets 5 stars from me. He was helpful, knowledgeable, courteous and friendly.
