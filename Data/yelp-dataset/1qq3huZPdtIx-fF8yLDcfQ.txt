4	This is a great place to get massages and facials...all their body treatments are incredible. I have been getting massages from Kira for a couple of months and she is awesome. They use hot towels there and it is the best experience ever. I have a spa membership and it's one of the best deals out there. I went there to begin with because I had a groupon but the great service keeps me going back.
4	CUTE boutique salon and spa...I got a hair cut with Lindsay who was nice, friendly, and pleasantly chatty. I was promptly taken back with her and offered tea (yum), we talked about my plan for my hair style, she did a lavender oil scalp massage (wow), we got to the shampoo room which is blocked off with a thick curtain to give you some privacy and combined with the lavishness with Aveda products it makes something mundane absolutely SERENE! The cut itself was great and she blowdried/flat ironed my hair. A COMPLIMENTARY hand massage was offered (didn't take it :(  ), a COMPLIMENTARY make up touch up was offered (powder, blush, lip gloss was applied), and a COMPLIMENTARY 5 minute photo shoot was offered (sorry no time today Studio 262). Very cool approach and it made a monthly experience SPECIAL!!! It was about $40 for the cut and i have LONG hair! They also have a fabulous monthly spa membership for just $59/month---I will be checking it  out soon!
