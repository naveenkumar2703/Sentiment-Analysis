1	Office manager was very rude. They refused to honor the negotiated price of my insurance, saying the doctor did not agree to that price. They wanted to charge me $80 instead of $25. When I asked to speak to the dentist, that did not agree on the price I was told it would be $95. I Just left. This place is the worst, staff was rude and very Ghetto
5	Great service!  Super fast!  Tony the dental assistant was so efficient and gentle.   Dr Miranda really knows how to assess the patients needs and handled my teeth like I was family.  Thanks Radiant dental!!!
5	I had my wisdom teeth removed by Dr. Ruiz about 3 months ago. He did an amazing job. I was comfortable and calm throughout the whole procedure. I love this office and staff. I wait a short amount of time to be seen by the dr. It's not like other offices where they have you sitting in the waiting room for an hour. I recommend this office to anyone looking for a fast, comfortable and caring dental office :)
5	The office staff at Radiant Smiles treats you like family. They are nothing short of compassionate,  friendly and professional. When anyone asks for a good dentist I always point them in their direction. My son and  I were one of their 1st patients and remain faithful because they are just plain awesome! Thanks once again guys for cleaning my chompers tonight!
