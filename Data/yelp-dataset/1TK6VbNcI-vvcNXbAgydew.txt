1	Came in for the second time. Clothes are pretty awful but I needed candles and with the recession I have to search high and low. The clerks are very rude , no eye contact, hello, goodbye or thank you. Loud personal conversations are going on in every department. I should work here. It is basically clock in then stand around and talk for 8 hours. The store is dark the mercy is very bad. The whole place smells like cheap glue. Poor lighting. You really feel like your at the salvation army
2	Went here for the first time yesterday.  Although it is clean and there was an okay selection,  I don't think I'll be back due to the extreme stink eye the loss prevention guy was giving me the entire time.  I was with my two kids, who were a little on the obnoxious side.  However they were not screaming and running. They were playing in the aisles,  looking at the toys and fighting over things..... As 7 and 3 year old sisters tend to do.  I'm pretty sure he followed me around for the last half of my time there and as I waited in line and mu kids wandered through the accessories, daggers were shooting out his eyes. I kind of felt like he thought we were going to rob him and wreck the place. I found a couple pairs of shoes for my youngest that I promised her I'd buy. Or I would have left without spending any money there.  Pretty sure I'll only go back there if I have to.
2	This Ross store always looks like a tornado hit it.  Beside low stock there are always items all over the floor. I never see staff picking things up to rehang them.  I would suggest going to another Ross location.
