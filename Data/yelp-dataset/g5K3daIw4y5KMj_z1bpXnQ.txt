5	Nice guys. Showed me around the shop n answered all my questions.
5	First time to the shop to get broken pistons pressed off and new pistons pressed on. Red, who is the owner and who also does most of the precision work as he explained, is very professional, knowledgeable, and was kind enough to show me around the shop as I arrived to pickup my stuff right at closing time. All I can say is wow! They can do just about any kind of automotive machining and their prices are very fair. I highly recommend checking this place out if you need any engine or component work done.
5	This shop rocks!I have a GTO spare tire ( donut)  that I obtain for my modified vehicle,  the wheel did not fit the hub so it needed to be machined 2.86 more in the diameter of the center hole,  I brought it here and for a very low price they machined it to the right size and now it fits my application perfect!  They make engines,  next time I need one I will be going there.  Their attention to detail is appreciated and all the work is done in same shop.
