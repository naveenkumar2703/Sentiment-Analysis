3	A-OK here stands mostly for:Alright, Overpriced but Kalright. I was (now am again) in desperate need for a wax. I'm not going to tell you what I needed to have waxed, suffice to say the plight of the great Mediterranean blood hits me quite hard and I like to keep up appearances that I am not, in fact, a woman of the bush or an unkempt hippie. So, I went a-hunting for a wax. Did I want threading? No, but found about a hundred places to do that. Did I want plucking? No, but I found a weird cheap place that did that. But I found PURE and they were a beautiful little place that felt all comfy, relaxing and spa-like. But for a 20 minute session inside a locked room, these bells and whistles mean very little. Soothing music gets overshadowed by the pain, so frankly it fell on dead - eyes? I paid 35 dollars (20 quid). For shame! (did I use this right British people?). Yea, I know. There are little Vietnamese ladies in Boston screaming at me from overseas - I'll do it for your for 1/4 that price. But I was beastly, and my uni-brow was making a comeback and I can't have that. But the hair (was) gone, so not too many complaints. She did it, well and quick, so if you like spending 20 pounds on something that should be 8 - TOPS... This place is for you, you freak. And the hunt continues.
