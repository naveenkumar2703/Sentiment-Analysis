3	Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn!Cheap jeans galore. I didn't buy anything because I wasn't in the market for denim but had I been; I could have walked out of there in a new Canadian Tuxedo for pretty cheap. Every style is sold at discounted prices for men, women, and children. Denim Dan anybody?
3	Have shopped here several times.  There are great deals to be found here.  I usually buy a few pairs of jeans each visit for about $20 each.The employees have always been fine, and the store is clean and well organized.  Check them out for yourself.  You might find something you need.
5	You know I did not buy anything over there. They were Nice and helpful, But needs work with quality of shorts and pants Along with better styles that fits The guys standards they were too tight
4	So the bf needed some new jeans so I suggested that we come here. I don't actually own a pair of Levi's since they never seem to fit me properly, but I know a bunch of people who swear by them. We were greeted by an employee when we first walked in who offered assistance. We wanted to look around first since the bf wasn't too sure what to look for. We wandered to the slim section and noticed that the bf's size was waaaay up high on the wall. Another employee (we called him Kevin Hart) offered assistance and he was really fun to talk to. He got the size down and chatted us up. The bf then tried them on and realized that the slims were definitely not his style. He then found the 505 Regular that fit him perfectly. They were on a deal for $39.99 when you buy 2 and we found another pair which were 50% off. So I think we made off pretty good with 3 pairs of jeans. Overall, it was a successful shopping trip. The employees were friendly and helpful and we made off with 3 pairs. We will definitely be back.
