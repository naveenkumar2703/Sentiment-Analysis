5	You save lives! Enough said?They have a professional staff that are kind and conversational that take you through the whole process. Since their staff are full time pros and not volunteers I've never had them miss a vein or have to do any significant adjustments or re-sticks.There is always a need.
4	I've been donating blood for decades. It's one of the few morally unambiguous things you can do these days. In addition, I have many friends who cannot donate for a variety of reasons so I try to take up the slack. I usually donate at work but, because of the summer, they skipped a cycle so I checked at the ARC to see about walk-ins.West Madison's ARC center wins the prize for the quickest donation EVER! Granted, it was slow day over there and I know the ropes but, I was out in 45 minutes! After quick, friendly and professional attention, I was sipping OJ, eating a cookie and walking out with a free loaf of Panera bread (on Thursdays and Fridays) under my arm in less than an hour.I won't suggest that you'll get through that quickly but, if you can, donating blood should be a thing. Do it. Save lives!
