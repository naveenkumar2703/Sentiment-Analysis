4	Phoenix summers, while I love them and the heat they bring, are a real drain to car batteries. This wasn't news to me, but it's still aggravating when you can't even get a battery to survive 10 years here, much less the five that I've had my car. But, paradise comes at a price. My Saturday morning plans were altered slightly by my visit to Autozone, as I'd planned on just starting the day doing laundry. So there I was, in my butch attitude replacing the battery myself. After I left, I remembered having purchased prior batteries here for my vehicles--it turns out I was still under warranty and was able to return and get the difference credited back. So, while part of me thinks this could have been avoided altogether, I now have some money in my pocket and a coupon to Sonic that's going to good use. Huzzah yea!
5	Fixing up the VW with the pops and we need some belts. We usually go to a different auto zone so this was out of the way.There was an older gentleman who was quick with a joke and very nice.It made the routine stop to the auto shop slightly more enjoyable. The interaction was enough for me to write a review about the place, which I was not going to originally. Thanks!R\_
4	Good prices and good service. I had a check engine light on in my vehicle so I took it to this Auto Zone. They came outside and checked the diagnosis code using their tools. Then we went back in and the employee looked up my code and lead me in the direction of possible causes. After returning home and doing some research, I narrowed down the problem and returned to Auto Zone. The part that I needed was very particular and usually not manufactured by itself. The employee searched long and hard through his database, and we ultimately determined that the part was not inventoried by the Auto Zone chain. Ultimately I fixed the problem, and the part was indeed difficult to come by. I appreciate the service that I was given at this particular Auto Zone.
