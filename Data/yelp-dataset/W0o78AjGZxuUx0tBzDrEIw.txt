3	Small location tucked in a strip mall that is highlighted by Old Navy and Cost Plus.  The falafel place next door is worth your time.Reduced selection of New Balance shoes compared to the North Scottsdale location, but often the sales are quite good.  Staff isn't too bad either.  Not a lot of room inside to jog to try out your shoes, but I don't think they mind the sidewalk outside.
3	I tend to buy shoes, or any clothing item for that matter, when what I am wearing falls completely apart..  The soles on my last pair of shoes had split wide open and I had heard several good things about New Balance so I stopped in here.  Compared to what I had seen on the internet there was a pretty small selection of styles.  Most of the styles I wanted to try on were in stock in my size and I found a pair I was comfortable with.  Of course 2 weeks later they were on sale for $15 off. :(  So far the pair I purchased is comfortable, we'll see how they are after a year or so.
4	I love New Balance shoes so it is always nice to see the store is readily available. I just recently got back into exercising and needed a good pair of shoes. Not to mention my podiatrist said I needed good stability to help prevent rolling. Found the perfect shoes here. Stabilizers, comfortable, and more importantly, in Wide sizes. My only negative is the limited selections for wide sizes. I went back 6 months later to replace my favorite shoes that were worn and they no longer carried that specific style in wide. I was pretty sad. Otherwise, great store.
