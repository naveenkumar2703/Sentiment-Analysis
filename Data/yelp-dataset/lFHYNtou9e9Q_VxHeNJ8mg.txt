4	This looks like a fairly new Holiday Inn.  The room was very up to date, and came with a flat screen, and free WiFi.  The fitness room was very big for a hotel with a nice variety of modern equipment.  The staff was friendly and efficient. There is also a restaurant and bar on site that has daily specials like $2 beers or margaritas. If you want to eat outside of the hotel,  there are a bunch of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.  The hotel is located right off I-10 but you really don't hear any of the highway noise. And if you forget anything at home, there is a Walmart across the street as well.
4	They really know how to take care of their guests here. A lot of amenities at no extra cost is a plus.I came here on a business trip and they cater to a typical business person. They have a business center with free copies, fax and computer and Internet access. They also have a fitness center. Couple of semi-old treadmills, exercise bike and an elliptical machine with some weight machines.There's a bar and grill next to the lobby. And they have daily happy hour specials.And as for the room itself, very nice. The bathroom has a large tub, tv has free HBO, free wi-fi, microwave and refrigerator. Everything looks pretty modern and up to date.The per diem was within my company's approved list because of the affordability so it's most likely going to be in your company's approved list as well, so if you happen to be near the west Phoenix area, I would recommend this hotel. It's close to many restaurants and shopping centers and all within walking distance too. It's location is right off the 10 freeway.
4	Stayed here over the Christmas holiday. My only complaints are that the advertised continental breakfast was an extra cost and the fitness room was lacking; ie 2 of the 4 cardio machines were either out of order or on their way out of order. Staff was great, housekeeping excellent!
