4	There is a worrying trend developing where charity shops in city centres, studenty, or bohemian areas, now seem to act more like vintage fashion stores rather than the dusty old purveyors of bric-a-brac they once were. I'm sure it makes business sense as by doing this they'll attract both younger and more numerous customers, but when a charity shop's main draw switches from saving some starving baby to "Oh my god I look just like Audrey Hepburn in this dress", it doesn't say much for 21st century society.All I've ever bought from Oxfam was a porcelain mouse, and a little ornamental duck. 50p each. I bought them for the right reasons.
4	Clerk Street seems to be filled with charity shops and of course Oxfam could not be missing from here. So if you want to do a bit of your "feel-good" shopping and save up some cash then this is the place to be.For those of you who may have not wondered into an Oxfam store, it has it's own merchandised brand. This particular store seems to have everything, from clothes and handbags, to Oxfam cards, stationary and food. It is slightly more expensive than it's neighbouring charity shop and I never really understood why. Yet I still head for this street and shop in particular when looking for clothes to make a costume out of or for the occasional bric-a-brac one feels like they really need when really they don't. (and it still beats the overpriced costume shops for a better cause)
5	I think shops like these are brilliant! I fully salute all charity shops - it's completely guilt-free shopping!Ok so their stock isn't exactly brilliant, but it's not bad. They have quite a selection though, it's worth coming in here just for a look around, chances are you'll see something you like or need. The staff are really lovely too, they are happy to help and happy just to chat.It's so worthwhile coming in here, it's all for a good cause. So next time you need something, come in here first!
