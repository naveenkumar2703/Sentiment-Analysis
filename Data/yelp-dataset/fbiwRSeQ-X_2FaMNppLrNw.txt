5	Green Savvy is a proffesinal and effeciant buisness. They make the process in aquiring your medical marijuana card quick and easy. They will complete all necessary paper work after they have either recieved your medical records or can even reffer you to a local docter, even located in the same complex. Great prices and was a pleasure to do buisness with.
5	The guys at Green Savvy made the process of getting my MMJ card quick and easy. Give them a call. They will guide you and make the process easier than you could imagine. If you dont have recent medical records, they will refer you to a friendly specialist. All for a minimal cost. G.S. is friendly, helpful, discrete and made the process quick and easy. I would recommend them to anyone. Call Sam and tell him Al sent you.
