2	Went to this location to cash a check from one of my tenants.  Since the check was written from a US Bank account, I wanted to cash it at a US Bank office to make sure the funds cleared.....you never know nowadays.The teller asked me if I was a current US Bank customer.  When I told her no, she said that there would be a $5 charge to cash the check.....What?  Since when did banks charge you to cash a check written from their Bank???I asked her what my options were.  She said:1 - You can open a US Bank account.....yeah right....I don't think so.2 - I can deposit it at a Bank where I have an account.  The funds will clear in 3 to 5 business days.  What?  No way...that's not an option....I want my money now.3 - I can pay the $5 fee and cash it right away.Well, I had no choice....I had to pay the $5 Rip-Off Fee......screw this bank.Will I return?  I'm forced to because I have to cash my tenant's check here and I don't believe in passing along charges like this to my customers.  But will I ever bank with US Bank?  HELL NO!

I regularly use the ATM. I do like that they have a drive-thru ATM so you don't have to get out of your car and go inside after hours and can drive right on up at any hour and handle a majority of your banking needs right at the ATM. I do most of my banking that way.I love that it is in a shopping center so it is convenient to handle what I need to at the ATM and then go shopping or grab something to eat right in the same parking lot.
