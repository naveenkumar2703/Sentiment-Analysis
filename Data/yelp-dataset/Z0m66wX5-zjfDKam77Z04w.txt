4	A very lovely cheese and souvenir shop.  I was very lucky to come across this shop while walking around downtown.  They are very helpful, and let me know that the cheese could travel home to  LA in my carry-on without any ice.  So I got to take cheese home to my friend and myself instead of the "Cow Tipping" T-shirt I had seen at the airport.  They get a star for supporting Family Farmers.
5	I've been here once.  I don't know how it stays in business.  Whatever you're doing, House of Wisconsin Cheese, you're doing it right.  Keep ripping off those fucking tourists.
