3	Good selection of spray paints and home repair items.  Store is well laid out to make finding just the right items easily.
4	God I love this place! Don't get me wrong; Depot has always been my personal Man Cave. But ACE has that little something the others don't. Like whatever that bolt or nut or screw or attachment or fastener or that little whatsyamacallit your needing, yeah you get it! Great customer help that comes with a little small town appeal; yep that's it!
4	Since Ace Hardware is just down the street from our home, I come here quite a bit. Unless I want to save some money, I'll take the time to visit Lowe's or Home Depot. But this place will have items that are hard to find elsewhere. Always have the items I needed, very friendly staff willing to help you at all times. Wonder whats going to happen to this place when they eventually build the Home Depot near by at the Prasada?
4	I love going to Ace for the simple fact that i almost never know what i am doing and there is always someone that is there right when i walk in the door. Whether i come in to get a new key or trying to do a home improvement project. I have gone up there several times and just shown them a picture of what is wrong at home and they know exactly what I need to fix it.
4	Great place to go if you don't want the hassle of going to the zoos of Lowes and Depot in the Surprise area.  While those two are on a nightmare corner (especially in snowbird season) this Ace is in a great location.  It's rarely busy and the customer service is great.  If I'm spending a lot and need to save the money I'll still go to the zoos, but if I just need a couple of small things I will go here every time.
