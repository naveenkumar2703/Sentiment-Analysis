4	This store is full of items to decorate the house, but it also has seasonal items that will surprise you.  I came in, on a quest for a laundry hamper, still haven't found what I am looking for, and this is one place on my list.  No luck at that, but did find a really cute holiday decoration to add to my "Texas cowboy" theme.  I also found a couple items for stocking stuffers, a pocket size manicure set for $6 and a rather unique knitted wrap.  I am a sucker for anything that is knitted or crocheted. For small pieces for the house, wall hangings, candles, and gift items, this is a good place to shop, prices seemed good and the unique items I found ensures this will be a place to re-visit.
4	This store has a home feel to it. Hmmm it's packed with projects and items that will make your home unique. They have a mailing list also if you would like to join the list this bothers me for one reason. Why are we not all treated as equal's you mean I have to give you my home address or email so I can shop and get nice things. Why cant everyone enjoy the same great deals. If sally can pay 2 dollars with a coupon. I say why can't we all and what's so cool about sally? Maybe it's her coupon. Well, on a long list of maybe's here is a huge maybe lmao maybe I will take my business some place else. Where we all get the same deals. And people don't pressure me by stepping into my personal life by sending me tons of junk mail. Coupon Soupon I like my privacy. Over all I give them three stars ok four stars the store is always nice and fun and the staff are always kind and professional.
