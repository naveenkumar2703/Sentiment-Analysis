5	I'm from Massachusetts.  I don't need to say anything else.
4	One issue: This Dunkin Donuts can be hard to find. It's inside the Chevron station with the large car wash operation on the east side of Signal Butte Road (south of Hwy 60).My Dunkin Donuts coffee kicked ass as always. It's so much better than Charbucks coffee.
4	For coffee and donuts I still think DD is the best. I guess when I was in my early 20's, the time I really started drinking coffee, I lived in Rhode Island and these were on every corner. You can't beat their boston cream donuts. Their original coffee is still the best hands down! I wish they had been more successful in getting espresso products so I didn't have to make my cappuccino at home! They do have a dunkachino which is a yummy mysterious coffee blend! I have no clue what is in it but it sure is good!
2	We just had coffee and donuts at this Dunkin today. I will not return. The floor was littered and dirty, the tables were left uncleaned, there was no or very little air conditioning and something left to burn in the kitchen smelled so badly that we had to leave and finish our coffee and donuts in the car!! When I asked the person taking orders about senior coffee she said she didn't know !!! And never asked! I do not leave bad reviews unless it is so bad that someone needs to know.... So clean up your act Dunkin! This Dunkin was not in the Chevron station. It was on Southern and Signal Butte!
