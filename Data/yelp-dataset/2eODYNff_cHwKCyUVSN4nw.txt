1	This doctor's office is absolutely ridiculous.  They are not professional.  Front desk receptionists are extremely rude.  With an appointment, you wait 2 hours.  Dr. Vogel will come in an not apologize, she just complains.She is very spacey.  She will ramble about her Catholic beliefs, articles she read in Cosmo that "pertain to me".  She is not ready to diagnose yet, she wants to get to know me.BEWARE she is a quack doctor.  This office not only makes you wait for 2hours, you meet with the doctor and leave wondering what just happened,  I will never get those three wasted hours back.  I have worked for hospitals billing dept.  This doctor charges an absurd amount for unsolicited religious bias, and Memorable Cosmo articles.I paid my co-pay at my visit, only to receive a collection bill in the mail requesting my co-pay again.If this is a referral, ask for someone else.
5	Dr. Vogel is the best doctor I have had since I was diagnosed with Diabetes.    A  person  couldn't  get  a  better  Doctor.  She is  caring, she is very professional. Her bed side manners are impeccable. She   listens  well  to her patients  and  always  takes  hers  time  with  you.    Unlike  others,  she  still  takes  new  patients.   The  time  you  might  wait  to  get  in  is  well  worth  it!   Her office  staff  is  really  very kind and very  helpful.
1	This place has the rudest staff.  I will never go back.  They screwed up my bill and the girl in billing was so darn rude.  Who hires someone with such a bad attitude?
