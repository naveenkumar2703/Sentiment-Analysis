5	My husband and I just got back from Berlin and on our way there, we had time to kill in Terminal 2 of the Sky Harbor.  THANK GOD we were in Terminal 2...with the badass Military & Veterans Hospitality Room!My husband is Active Duty Army and I am in the National Guard, so this room was an option (sorry for you non-military types).It's too easy...you sign in and they give you the tour.  There are couches, computers with internet, and a "library" where you can take books for your flight (you don't  even have to TRADE!).  There is also a room for "little kids" with toys and a TV,  a room for "big kids" with a TV, reclining seats and a dimmed setting.  Oh, and some tables to go along with the free grub and sodas..you got popcorn, gum..all kinds of nice little things.The people here were friendly, the room is clean, cool and comfortable.  If you have a long lay over and are military, move yourself over to terminal 2 to hang out for a bit...they will be VERY happy to see you!
3	Clean, bright and accesible
2	1. I've been here twice. That is two times too many.2. Terrible airport food, which means it's atrocious.3. Security line is always really long and slow, it's like flying out of Kona. You are in the back of the line for an hour wondering what on earth is going on and you see people sneaking through with shoes on. They all can't work for the airline!
5	I love USO lounges. They are such a nice option for large families with children, to grab a snack, pass time, and keep people with delays occupied. I think it is a great way to thank our servicemen and women. My fiance is Army and I have enjoyed exploring the lounge.
