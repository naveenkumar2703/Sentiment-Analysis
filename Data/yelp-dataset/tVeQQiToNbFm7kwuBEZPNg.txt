5	I love this place for getting my son's haircuts. Yes, the price point is high for a kids cut but that he's sitting in a firetruck chair watching his favorite movie while getting a haircut is well worth it. And he gets a nice quality cut.
4	I had never been to this location before, but I'm really glad I went in. They were able to fix my daughters hair after her attempt at self beautification involving scissors and her bangs and sides.  Ug.They did a fantastic job!!!
5	The Manager at this location is AWESOME! I think her name is Diana. I took my almost two year old buddy K here to get a a trim. He was NOT happy about being in the barber chair. Diana was very patient with him, cause it took us a long time to get comfortable. She made a few suggestions was was able to work her magic and trim his hair while he cried the whole time. He ended up with a very nice and even haircut. I can't say enough about how great this place is for little kids. Another tip, if you are a walk in there might be a bit of a wait. You can make an appointment as well.
2	Cute place for kids but overly priced. $20 for my 5 year old boy to get a buzz cut. Not worth it to sit in a taxi.
