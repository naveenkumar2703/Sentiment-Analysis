4	My friend and I made the trek out to Bingemans Park for the Berlin Klassic, an all German car show. Porsches, Mercedes, VW and BMWs filled out the show. Since we were early for the festivities, we took a walk around Bingemans to see what was there. Besides the main building which hosts banquets (a U of Waterloo one was happening that Sunday) there is a camping area for tenting as well as a section of Yerts and as well small cottages for rent. There is even a small river flowing by the campsites looking nice and picturesque. We also noticed a water park with water slides which did not appear to be operating that day but looked complete and functional. The main area with the car show had plenty of free parking for visitors in addition to the main parking area where the car show took place. The Klassic show itself is highly recommended with plenty of cars to see and ogle and the on site dyno facility provided by a tuning company for $60 a session was icing on the cake!
4	Good place to take the kids and play for a couple of hours. The play structure is one of the best I've seen. Food is ok. There is a new Boston Pizza and bowling here but I haven't tried that yet.
2	Probably good place for kids. For camping the facilities are adequate and the sites are ok, but not very private. The area is very noisy.  The place is good to go camping with kids if you are going to the water park, mini golf etcetera .This is definitely NOT the place to go for quiet reflection, nature camping. You might as well camp in your city backyard. I'm not likely to come back.No wifi in campground unless you are in the office.
