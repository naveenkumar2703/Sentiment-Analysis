4	I hate dentist visits. I mean, I REALLY HATE dentist visits. I think more than most. However...I like this place! Every single person, from the receptionist to the hygenist, to the Dr. is very nice and listens. I have a few spots that are extremely sensitive, and they were probably the most "gentle" in dealing with those areas than anyone else I have ever been to. They also took the time to talk, in depth, about my treatment plan. It was not just a situation, like many in the past, where they presented you with a list of needed work, the expected charges, and gave you an appointment. The staff really took the time to talk to you.As much as I dread dentist visits, I am glad that there is a place like this where I can feel.....well.....comfortable.
5	This place is Great!! They have been my dentist of choice for the past 10 years. Dr DeBaker is a great dentist. He is very informative. Other staff is great too from the receptionists right down to the dental assistants and hygienists.
5	They got me in same day, SO THANKFUL the dentist and staff was funny and nice! Then, I was still having an issue by no fault of theirs and they fixed it free. So grateful they are here!
