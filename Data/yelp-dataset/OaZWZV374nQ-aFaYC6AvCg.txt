5	I just called to place a very last minute order and spoke with Michelle, one of the owners and I can not express my thanks and gratitude enough for the most excellent customer service I received.  I know that the 50th Anniversary shirts ordered will be amazing and that I will never use another printing company based on what I just experienced.  Thank you so very much to Michelle!!!
5	I live in Boston and this is the only place I will have this service done.  The quality is amazing and the service impeccable.Michelle and her folks are all fantastic.  Warm friendly service is balanced with professionalism and expertise.  They offer suggestions regarding materials, fonts, colors, and combinations all of which are perfectly suited to the individual client.The operation is fantastic you receive your order when promised and quality control is great.  I supply my organization worldwide and it all comes out of a little shop in Tempe, AZ.  I even added a leg to a business trip to stop in overnight (they are a stones throw from the airport) and went over on my way to Sky Harbor.  The smiles and having them remember your name all makes this the kind if place you want to do business.  You won't be disappointed.
1	Disappointed that this place charged me $20/screen x 4 screens for set up and then decided to 'reclaim' my screens and asked that I pay the set-up fee AGAIN when I wanted to do another run a year later.Service is friendly and professional, except for the principle of double charging set-up fees as described above. Hence I would not recommend them or use their printing services again.
5	I have used Arizona hot tees several times over the past few years. Michelle is always great and easy to deal with. They offer fair pricing, and will ship your order if needed. I am in Chicago, one of their orders came out with a wrong phone number on the back of the shirt. They replaced them, with no questions asked.
