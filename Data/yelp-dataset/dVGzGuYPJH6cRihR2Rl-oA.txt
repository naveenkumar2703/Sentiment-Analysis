5	Had their chicken puff pastry pie today at the Realta Pass Sunday farmer's market.  Wow!  So yummy that my wife bought several.It tasted like just about the best chicken pot pie ever but wrapped in a flakey, buttery turnover.  Next time I'll try a lentil pie and the steak & potatoes one.
5	I was so happy to see them at the City North Farmer's Market.  I bought the Bbq Pork single pies and the Steak Fajita.  I had a taste of the apple one. YUM!  These are awesome options when the hubby is out of town or if you have people show up suddenly.  Quick salad and a little pie, ta da! lunch.As a matter of fact, I am going to cook a few for a brunch am throwing next week.  They are so flaky and buttery delicious.  Can't wait to try other flavors.
5	These are the most delicious things ever....all the flavors I have tired just rock, shepards pie, chicken, spinach and feta, pepperoni pizza, bbq pork and apple.  Pretty positive the others are equally amazing.   The pastry is flaky, tasty and the perfect wrapping for whatever is inside.  If you see these little nuggets of fabulousness at your local AZ farmer's market just get some.  Then go home, bake away and enjoy.  Not even a tiny chance you will be sorry.
5	These pies are really yummy, they bake up in no time at all so they make an easy quick meal for people on the go. Plus, the best part - no thawing needed! A really tasty, flaky crusted all natural alternative to hot pockets with a much much larger variety of types. Only thing I would add is a variety pack or a sampler because for new customers they might not want to commit to a whole bag of one pie type.
5	OMG! These are amazing! We got the pulled pork and breakfast one, Will definitely be going back for more of these at RoadRunner Park Sat Market.  They are so flakey and the fillings are incredible!
