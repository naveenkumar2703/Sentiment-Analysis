4	Me and a few friends came here on a mini bar crawl on the way to a flat party. Although I had had a few pints by the time I had got to this pub I did enjoy this pub quite a lot. It wasn't as busy as the other bars we went to that night, but the decor and the atmosphere was good, with a range of local photos and pictures dotted around. There was a good range of people coming to the pub ranging from office workers to students.They had a good selection of drinks on sale and there was a a range of newspapers that were free to pick up and read. The pub also ahas a well kept pool table, which we played a few games on. There was also a jukebox in there, which had music that would fir the taste of anyone, no matter what decade of music tickles their fancy.
3	Well preserved original interior, sensible prices and a good range of beers and spirits make this a no nonsense pub in which to watch the sport on the tv or just start a night out in unpretentious surroundings.
