3	A very solid, inexpensive pizza buffet. I like the food much better than Cici's. The cheesy breadsticks are heart-stoppingly good. The buffet includes a salad bar and some pastas, but I usually stick with the pizza. Only thing lacking is the dessert selection doesn't compare with Cici's. A lot of the time there is no dessert pizza out. They will make whatever you ask for though so that's a definite plus. Could stand to have the tables and booths wiped down a bit more frequently as well.
