4	Might be the cheapest / best retail store to pick up a new iPhone5 case this side of the Pacific. $9 for a clear rubber case (my phone is white) and a rainbow of other colors. They also have bumper-styles for $11-ish. Yes, you can order one on Amazon, but at least here you can see how the cases look / fit in person.A ton of iPhone4 cases, too, even cheaper. Noticed a wall full of knock-off Toms (shoes) for under $20 if you're into that kind of thing!
3	No more phone case mecca here :(Too bad!
3	So much potential here! Lots of space here. Someone hurry and rent some space, you got potential for growth! Theres a business in there that ships packages that I have never heard of the company. Wonder how much they charge. One thing for sure I loved the store in the corner with all the Chinese merchandize. I will visit here again and take pics!
3	I am kind of surprised this place is still in business... It's a great concept, nice presentation, and I wish that they had filled the spaces, but there are barely a handful of shops inside. It's so empty and deserted its awkward to be the only one shopping there. The prices are nothing special either. I'd just as well shop online or ebay or go to China town mall for the same things.
