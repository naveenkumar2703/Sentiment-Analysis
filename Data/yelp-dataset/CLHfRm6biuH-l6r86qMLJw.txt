4	This newly constructed building is that the SWC of E. Camelback Rd. and N. 7th St. The facility's nice but the parking lot is tight. Look all ways/directions before pulling out of your parking spot or entering street traffic from their lot.
5	Nice location, convenient hours, friendly staff - glad I made the switch to Chase before moving West.
5	Great help getting my issues taken care of with my account!!! Thank you :))Their bankers are extremely friendly and know their stuff.Sigh of relief when my problem was solved within a matter of hours.
1	Looking for a mortgage lender? Don't come here! unless you want to be lied to!I used Chase as my mortgage lender, and it was one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever endured. Robert Page, my mortgage lender, said that we would close on October 16th. Then he pushed it back until October 18th. Then he pushed it back until October 21st citing some ridiculous reason. Of course, we couldn't close on the 21 because of another ridiculous reason, so Robert pushed it back until October 25th. You see the trend? Then, we were supposed to close on October 28th....which didn't happen either. If you can't close on a certain date, then don't make a promise. It's that easy! I would have been much happier if you told me from the beginning that we wouldn't be able to close until October 29th...in which case I could have chosen a different lender.The situation got so bad that I had to reach out to Robert's boss, David Campbell. He said he would "take care of us" which is also another broken promise.]In an effort to rectify the situation, Chase promised to reimburse us for the rent we had to pay when we couldn't move in on October 16th. Of course, they reneged on that as well.Perhaps a federal credit union will be a better choice.
