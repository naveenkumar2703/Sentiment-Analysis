2	This is a review for the shooting range.I'm going to be honest; I have never been so uncomfortable in all my life as when I visited Usury, and that is saying A LOT. The guys that worked here were completely rude. What, a 5'2" chick with tatts can't shoot at your mountain? I swear, they were looking at me like a black man at a KKK meeting.I followed the rules every single time I shot, yet the range master felt compelled to YELL at me every time. Honestly? I have a CCW, own my gun and have been shooting since I was like 6. I'm pretty sure I know how to stay behind a line and point the gun at a target. I won't go here again. There are plenty of other places to give my business to where they won't discriminate.
2	As mentioned below - and being as close as they are to the Phoenix megalopolis - they need to supervise the range very carefully - but even so, and as experienced as I am, the scene makes me very uncomfortable.  It can be very intimidating and a real turnoff to someone who is relatively new.
1	I suppose getting screamed at and made to feel like a idiot for NON safety issues is common place here. I will never return to this dump, most of the staff are normal but a few are complete dicks. I will make it a point to turn away as many people as possible, paying customers should not be treated this way!
