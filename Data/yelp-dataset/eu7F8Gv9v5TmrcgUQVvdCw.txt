5	I loved how everyone was so friendly and I found some really good deals that you cannot find most of the time on ebay, craigslist etc. If you come here with $50 you can potentially walk out with a lot of stuff! Giant print screen blankets for $19, nail polishes and hair accessories for $1, lots of beautiful jewelry and food.Bre's bakery makes a delicious red velvet cupcake! There are tons of cheap toys for your little one and let's not forget clothes and fireworks! Only open on FRI, SAT, and SUN 10am-6pm.
4	What is there to tell?  It's pretty much a flea market.  Some of the vendors were playing up their wares while others were quieter however all were pretty nice.   There were some very cool items to be had it seemed.  Some were mere trinkets, some were pretty good quality...It depended on the vendor as you might expect.  It's not the biggest place I've ever seen and I'd not argue with seeing more vendors but all in all, I'd say it's worth swinging into.  There might be a trinket or treasure waiting for you there.  I personally felt like a kid in a candy store.
1	Trashy.  Like a giant ghetto dollar store.  poor quality products, sketchy environment, dirty.  Not to mention the drunk elvis impersonator.  This is not a "swap meet" and I'm sorry I wasted my time!
