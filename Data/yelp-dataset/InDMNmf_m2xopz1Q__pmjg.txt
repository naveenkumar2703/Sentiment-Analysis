4	Great place, fair prices.Cleaners are, for the most part, all the same.... if they get your clothes clean and don't ruin them, they're good... if not, they're bad.  This place shines in friendly, courteous service.  The lady who runs the place is funny and friendly and not afraid to chat it up.  Beware, she can be sarcastic, but I love that.  Never had a problem here and prices are fair.
1	I went one time for alterations on three pairs of dress pants and I will not be returning.  The pants were hemmed too short and after first telling me they would fix them at no charge (like any reputable place would), they agreed to fix them at half price. Thanks for nothing.
1	I will not be using their service any longer. They are fast but just barely acceptable service. My dress still had a spot with birthday cake frosting on it. Unreal. I didn't notice it until packing it for a morning flight. There must be other places that can do better!
