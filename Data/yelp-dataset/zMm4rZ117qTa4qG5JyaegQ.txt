5	The assistants are friendly and professional...
5	It's a shame I don't even know the name of the Dr. Who took care of us but he is a pro! I thought gingivectomy was supposed to be painful but no! He numbed 1/2 of my mouth in less than a minute. I've received local anesthesia from several dentists before, but no one was never this good. The procedure was smooth and quick. I usually fear to go back to the dentist but I can't wait for my next appointment. On the other note, they are running 1800/implant which I think is reasonable.
1	This office has the worst customer service I have ever experienced before. I came in for a deep cleaning. I was experiencing pain which is why I called to follow-up with the doctor. He never called me back. The front desk is terrible including the Office manger Evelyn!The doctor never calls you back if your experiencing pain. WORST dental practice EVER!!! Never go in and visit them. RUN if you can from this practice
5	Great experience like always. Dr Khorshid is very accommodating. He truly cares. He was able to see me on short notice as it was an emergency. Office staff is also very nice. Keep up the good work.
