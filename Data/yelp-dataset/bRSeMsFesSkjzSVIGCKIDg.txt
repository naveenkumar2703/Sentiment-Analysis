2	1st to review? I guess thats really no surprise word gets around that this place is BAD!!It's been quite awhile since I've been to Burger King mostly because they microwave everything right in front of you ans then tell you it was charbroiled. I was lured in by a co-worker willing to pay and wanting to try the NEW Funnel Cake sticks.I stay away from the burgers since they are FROZEN patties semi-broiled then microwaved. Not my kind of burger. I do however enjoy an occassional chicken sandwich microwaved or not. I ordered it MY WAY-plain.The chicken sandwich was ok but the funnel cake sticks were terrible-like a vanilla flavored straw made of straw. I couldnt eat them, neither could my son:(A place I wont be back to for another long while and thats not even due to the terrible service we experienced taking more than 20 minutes for 3 chicken sandwiches + 2 funnel cake sticks.
3	Come on now what do you want me to say in regards to burger king.  I will keep it plain and simple is a place where I come to get a quick bite to eat when im hungry that is all lol.  I approve this message
1	Went here for lunch the other day since it is close to work. I ordered a grilled chicken ranch wrap. Got a fried chicken wrap with honey mustard. Chicken was fatty and gross but I should have expected that I guess. Not trying that again
