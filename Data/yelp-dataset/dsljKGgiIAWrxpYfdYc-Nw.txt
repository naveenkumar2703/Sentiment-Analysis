5	Looking for a QUALITY Leather Theater Group for my home... I am so tired of those furniture sales people treating me like I am just their next sale - Jodi took her time with me to get to know what I actually was looking for instead of trying to stuff me into a sale. She took the time to explain to me the difference between bonded: which is EVERYWHERE and REAL Leather. Knowledge IS power and she gave me the knowledge to make an investment in a beautiful piece at a great price that will last a long time in my home!! So happy I took the time to shop here!!  NONE BETTER!!
4	bought my leather sectional here a few years back...it is very nice...still looks great...they did not negotiate the price point i wanted, but, i bought anyhow. The sectional looks brand new!  Has not faded...it was about 4K delivered...but, worth it...i will get probably 20 years from it!!!!
1	Awesome leather furniture but the sales person, Jody I believe.... Horrible. We decided not to purchase there and went to another vendor who sells omnia leather. She gave us a price, we went back to order then she jacked it up nearly $1200 and refused to honor the original price she quoted and wrote down! Do your research, if you want omnia leather, find a different vendor!!! We did and couldn't be happier!
