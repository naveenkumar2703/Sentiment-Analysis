4	My friend and I stumbled across this bar (and I mean literally, I did kind of trip down the stairs), on a recent night out. The bouncer eyed us curiously, before asking us if we knew that the establishment in question was a gay bar, which we didn't. But of course that's all good, because I do like a good gay bar, for the classic reason a lot of straight girls come out with, that they're fun, relaxed, and you can sit and have a conversation without the hassle you might get in other bars, where a certain type of gentleman, on occasion, thinks they can push the line of banter into inappropriate, pestering behaviour. But I know girls pester blokes on occasion too, so I will try and be fair to both sexes.Anyway, this is a well furnished and polished looking wee bar, mostly aimed at gay men from the looks of things, as my friend and I were the only ladies in there. A couple of guys around the bar chatted away to us straight away, so the place had a good, friendly vibe to it. I was also really surprised to see quite a big, underground cave type club area going on downstairs, so the bar is obviously designed for a bit of dancing action too.

It's a great space, well laid out, with well placed mirrors.It was about 8pm so there were only a few groups of people around but it had that friendly, neighborhood bar feel.  If we lived in Edinburgh we would make this our hometown bar for sure.
