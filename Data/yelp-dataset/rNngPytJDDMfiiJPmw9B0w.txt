1	5 days it takes this lethargic water company to turn our water on in our new home in Surprise!  If you do have to deal with their customer service reps, you will see the perfect example of a company with no standards.
1	I had a water leak in and drip system that was never really use at my families rental.  Epcor's records show that we went from being a family using about 9k gallons of water a month to 35k gallons a month.  Our property has no pool and Epcor says they have no way to detect such discrepancies.  Really!!  As a young family being busy and never paying for a water bill quite like this, it took us a few months to notice.  Know that this company does not care about their customer and their service is extremely poor.  They are not willing to help us out in any way.
1	If you have automatic payments, you better check your bank statements! I caught them debiting my checking account twice! When I asked them about it, they knew there was an issue and was working on it. Supposedly I am not the only customer who got charged twice? This is why I cancelled Cox Cable, charging me something with out a notice? Looks like it's time to cancel my automatic payments. AGAIN!!!Check your bank statements!
1	I would rather not even give Epcor 1 star they are so outrageously overpriced. If I had any other choice I would never buy water service from them. Our water service is over double the cost of anyone I know and it doesn't include anything but water. No garbage we have to pay separately for that too.  Bad business to rob your customers!
