5	Awsome place. See cindy shes great for nails. You have to have the deluxe pedi done...the hot rocks are wonderful.Call before going in esp on weekend as they do get really busy.
1	Not impressed at all with the pedicure... I could of done a better job myself!
5	My Mother purchased a gift certificate for my 30th birthday. I was hesitant at first because the place looks so upscale and pricey but it is not! Its a good, clean, affordable, professional atmosphere. I wouldn't recommend the eye brow waxing but the nail tech, which is a male was thee best. He did such a great job my acrylic nails lasted 2 months! I will definetely go back
5	I love this place! The guy who does my peti massages my feet so good. Everyone is very friendly and remember you.The $20 peti gives you the basics but for $10 more you get a mud mask, sea salt scrub, hot oil lotion,extra massage and hot stone. Lovely!   Get my eyebrows done too pretty good they will do them how you want. Overall reasonable price and nice place.
3	I didn't have a bad experience at this salon. The service and prices were ok and I would go back because it's so close to home. The only thing I didn't like was that the spa pedicure with stone "massage" was extremely light and not given any effort because they want you to purchase the "deluxe pedicure" which includes a mud mask and additional massage but is also ten dollars more. I work on my feet all day and get pedicures mainly for that nice foot massage which was lacking here.
