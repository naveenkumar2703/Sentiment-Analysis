2	As Arik mentioned in his review, this place can make some good pies. If you're looking to pick up a pie or grab some dessert, this spot can be a good option.As far as dining here for lunch or dinner, it's nuthin special. American cuisine with no real surprises. They have an ok salad bar & can have some good soups (cheesy potato!) on hand, depending on what they made that particular day.They have just about zero vegetarian entree options on the menu. If you're a veg head dragged along to this place for a meal, you'll probably have to custom order some pasta with veggies or get creative in another manner. I'll be trying my best to avoid the place for meals, but meat-eaters might find something enjoyable...
4	Hooray for cozy, homey family restaurants with good comfort food. I like the relaxing family atmosphere, the friendly staff, and the menu that makes choosing your orders both easy (very well illustrated) and difficult (too many tempting items to choose from). Rand H. and I met here today for lunch. I ordered the pork loin and it was delicious - nicely seared, with savory mushroom sauce with crumbled gorgonzola and a hint of burgundy wine, all on a bed of piping-hot mashed potatoes. The side of steamed veggies and the hot cornbread complemented the dish perfectly. The pies were extremely tempting but after the filling meal, those are something to look forward to for my next visit(s).
