4	So I visited another Wildfire Casino, this one on N. Rancho Drive, which meant there is another WildBurger location to try out.  After visit two locations now, both appeared to share similar interior design implementation.  It is a casual local casino diner serving burgers, hotdogs, wings, and breakfast items, but looks pretty new and clean.Last time I was at a WildBurger, I tried their WildBurger so I thought I try out their other signature burgers at this location.  That meant ordering The Crispy Chicken Deluxe Sandwich and The Cajun Turkey Burger.  Both were good, but the clear winner was definitely The Cajun Turkey Burger (tasted better and not as heavy).The Fried Onion String was also a lot better here than the one I tried before, and I killed it all this time around, instead of leaving most of it on the plate.The Honey Garlic Boneless Wings had great flavor, was not spicy at all (for a medium), but it is made with cut up chicken breast pieces.  Even though it was fried perfectly and is moist inside, I think I will stick to the real chicken wings next time.4 stars for good food at a reasonable price, friendly service in a clean casino diner that does not overly reek of cigarette smoke.  Plus there was no line to wait in to be seated or to place an order on my visit.Oh yeah, in another month or so, they will expand their menu at all locations.  So will be interesting to see what else they cook up for the new menu.

I'm a little biased...they use Tillamook cheese (which I love).The star of the show, though, was the "To Die For Desserts". They have ice cream shakes, deep fried Twinkies, and house made Ding Dongs. We split the Ding Dong and it was fabulous. We both said afterwards that we'd go back just for that!! Shakes are $3 & the other 2 are $5/ea. Well worth the price!!!
