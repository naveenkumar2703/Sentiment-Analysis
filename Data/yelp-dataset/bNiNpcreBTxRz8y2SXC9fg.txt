3	Good donuts and coffee. Nothing spectacular but definitely would come back.
4	I still can't get over how I paid $2.99 for a coffee and 3 doughnuts! What a deal. I was debating whether or not to go to Krispy Kreme or Winchells but decided on the latter since it wasn't a chain and I could get Krispy Kreme elsewhere... .Winchell's shares space with Subway which was a little random but I didn't have any problem with it because the woman helping me and what I assume to be the owner were both very nice and sweet. I hadn't eaten doughnuts in a little over a year so I decided to go with a boston creme (one of my favorites) and got a chocolate glazed chocolate doughnut for my sister and a glazed for my friend.... They were by no means the best doughnuts I had eaten before, a little doughier than I had expected but it definitely hit the spot. They hadn't skimped on the cream and it oozed out of the doughnut with every bite and I was more than satisfied with my choice. I didn't try the other doughnuts but all my sister said was that it was okay as she scarfed it down. Would I come back again? Sure, why not. I will probably be back for EDC 2013 next summer so till we meet again Winchells. Keep up the friendly service! YELP 365: 159/365
2	Stale donut holes 14 for 2.49.  This Winchells is connected to a Subway. Got the breakfast $3.00 combo and they wouldn't even let me upgrade to a bottled water which I am most accustomed to back in California.  Really you couldn't charge me the extra .25 like other Subways, I'm willing to pay.  I figured since these two stores are connected there by the same ownership.  I give you 2 stars because I got my sandwich and donuts in one place but allow for upgrade please. It's ok if you don't I'm sure I won't be back.
