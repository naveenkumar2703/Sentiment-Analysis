2	Mr Burrito moved into Salsitas.   Drove in to get my usual breakfast burritos.  Got a shock at the window, the prices doubled!!   Then after waiting 15 minutes.  The glazed girl at the window forgot half my order and gave me the " What are you talking about look"   She mentioned a new owner and then I got worried.   I got fuzzy scorched eggs with a tiny amount of meat. No Cheese no NADA!   Their salsa is nasty.  Nothing worse then scorched eggs.  Twice the cost and bad food.  Such a deal.    Back to FILIBERTOS!
1	1. My Carne Asada was grilled, hard tortilla, dry, just nasty.2. I paid 5.50 for it! :/3. Salsa didn't help much
2	Just another of many cheap ass places to get overpriced kinda Mexican food the owner said it was the same family owned as salsitas as if that was going to help as I tried salsitas and I would much rather go to taco bell.  Well this is the first of a new franchise the owner said  hope its the last where's  the real food  anywho he left me talking to myself.
4	I stumbled across this restaurant when looking for food on a Sunday.  Nothing was open nearby but this Mexican restaurant so I thought I'd give it a try.  I ordered a Chimichanga meal which was very large and filling.  The food was very good for the money ($7) and the lady server was very nice.  There are TVs in the restaurant but none of them were working at the time.  If you want a quick bite of Mexican food, come here!
