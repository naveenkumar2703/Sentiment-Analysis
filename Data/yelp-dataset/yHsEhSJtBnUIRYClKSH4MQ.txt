1	Maybe we were there on a bad day.  This was the worst and the cheapest tasting pizza that we have had in some time.  The crust was bland, the cheese tasted like plastic and the little rubber eraser ends that passed for Italian sausage were chewy and flavorless.  They always seem to be empty when we eat next door at the GREAT Mexican restaurant.  I don't think they will be in business for very long.
4	Not sure what happened with the first review, but I met the Danish woman and was a fan too.  She and her husband work really hard.  I ended up going here because (1) it's close in Anthem and (2) I had purchased a restaurant.com coupon to try it out ($25 gift certificate for $2 with a minimum purchase of $35).'Knowing that we needed to spend at least $35, we got to a try a large pizza and a couple of salads.  I would say the freshness and taste of the salad was more appealing than the pizza.  Although the pizza is definitely tasty and fresh too, it's just not what I am into as it had a cornmeal type thick crust. Call me low class in the pizza category, but I am a big fan of Domino's thin crust.  For fancy pizzas, I love Stratta at the Wynn. However, I don't like deep dish or thick crust which is why I am not the hugest fan of the pizza here.  So, if you like something with a thicker crust, this could be your place. It's nothing against the, it's just the style they do.Also, the decoration is charming and it's clean.  The prices are more than reasonable especially considering its location and I really hope that this business makes it as they do make a quality product and put heart into their cooking and ambiance.
