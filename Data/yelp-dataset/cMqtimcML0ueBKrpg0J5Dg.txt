4	I purchased a groupon for eyebrow threading for this place and I am so happy I did! This is a great clean place & the people are super friendly! $8 for eyebrow threading is a decent price, most places have higher prices. In NJ I use to get my eyebrows threaded for $3-$4 but I have not been able to find a place that does it that cheap in AZ, so far this business is the best I have found here!
5	Eyebrows and lip for 13?! Can't beat that!! I had been driving all the way from the west side to Arrowhead mall to get my eyebrows and lip done, now I save gas and money going here.  Might I add, I am very picky about my eyebrows so I won't review lightly in this subject.  Every time I have gone, the same girl is there, and she is awesome!! No complaints about this place, always happy with services : )
1	Worse threading job I've ever gotten. I explicitly asked for "cleanup" and not to go too thin. Not only did I get very thin brows, one eyebrow is incredibly choppy & will now have to fill in my brows. I would have been better off plucking.
5	It isn't in the best neighborhood but they do a really great job on my eyebrows. I am SUPER picky about them so it's rare for me to like a place this much. I won't go anywhere else! Only $8 too!
