4	I was planning on doing a little trout fishing in Oak Creek Canyon, and was in need of Powerbait. I was in a hurry, so I pretty much ran in and ran out, and didn't have much of a chance to check out the shop. My impression was that it was smallish, but had all the essentials, and was very neat and tidy.I also remember that, with no prompting from me, the guy who directed me to the bait called a friend of his up in the Canyon to ask exactly what trout were biting on at the moment. Now that's customer service!
5	I work near here, so even though I live down the street from Bass Pro Shop, I still come here where they know their stuff! I can get better deals and find hard to find items.
5	A bass fishing mecca. More fun than a big box joint. No little annoying kids, no carnival atmosphere. You walk in and the dude behind the counter is a fellow bass fisherman, like you. If you are a local, or just visiting, swing by. You will find something you need!
5	Closed forever. Sorry, FC. Gonna miss ya! Support your local tackle shop.
