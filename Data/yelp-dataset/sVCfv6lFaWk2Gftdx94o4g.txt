5	I absolutely love my nails now that Mary at Palace does them!  She is fast, personable and extremely professional but above all she is an artist!
4	The work the ladies do at this place is awesome! The owner makes you feel welcomed and shares stories with you and remembers you everytime you come in! The only downfall is its a little pricey. If I could afford it this would definitely be my spot!
5	Love this place. Would go more often if it wasn't on the other side of town. It was surprisingly empty, which I loved. The ladies were very nice. The worst part of any manicure is unnecessary waiting or them taking their time. The ladies here work fast, but are very thorough. Our manicures were literally flawless. Could not be happier. One thing, the color of the actual gel is nothing like the color on the bottle. We get gel all the time and have had this problem maybe a couple of times.
5	This is way overdue: I wanted to get permanent makeup for a long time, but I was afraid of not being happy with the results. I saw a coupon in the www.zipcodemagazines.com and decided to go for a consultation: Darlene the owner explained the process very good and she made me feel so comfortable I decided to go for it. I had eyeliner done and I am so happy! Clean place, job done right, right price. Love it!
