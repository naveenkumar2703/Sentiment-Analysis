1	Brett and Jordie were hired to do a simple kitchen remodel and this was the worst experience of our life.  We would recommend anyone but Las Vegas Remodel and Construction.  Their business philosophy is simple grind out job after job, no matter the cost to the client.  They will fight you on everything, even things they know were wrong.  They first deny everything and then place blame.  Nothing but an argument and extremely poor communication.In the end they only want their money for the job, without regard to the client.  Case in point, we finally completed the job and were discussing the punch list or walkthrough items.  Brett demanded final payment prior to completing the walk through items, even though we had to signed documents stating clearing that the payment was due until all walkthrough were completed.  We have so many more examples, that I cannot write them all.  Thank you Brett and Jordie for one of the worst experience in our lives.  You need to take customer service classes and get some ethics.
