1	"Thank you for choosing Cox!" I didn't choose you. You're the lesser of two evils and this stores customer service is beyond reproachable. They seem to think someone who barely speaks English greeting you at the door is good service, but it's just one lazy person standing around while you wait 40 mins to get help. They "triage" people by your services. New services -- front of the line. Problems - sit and watch a children's movie with the volume cranked up.The greeter is apparently too dumb to remember your name, so he puts people on the wait list by descriptions. The woman who came in before me was "old lady with short hair" someone else was "fat hispanic by door". That's so much easier than your name.I was in the store on 4/30/12 and it was a horrific experience. Cox seems to think they earn your business, but really where else are you going to do?
1	The guys that were there the day I went suck and are rude.  If all the customer service people were like these guys then I would scream from the tops of roofs to not  get cox.  They should be more like the guys at the Chandler location....those guys were awesome.
5	I've had Cox service for about a year and a half. Decided to upgrade my services and went in with my mom the other day to pick up a new HD receiver box for the cable. They have a check-in podium where you enter your name and wait to be called. It was around lunch time, so they were pretty busy. After a short wait, we were called up. The customer service rep there was great! I believe his name was Louis. He was really upbeat and funny. Had me and my mom laughing. Got us the equipment quickly, gave me clear instructions and sent me on my way. Did the self install and everything works great!
