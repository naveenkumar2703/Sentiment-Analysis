2	This is my first time to get pizza from Little Caesars.  My husband wanted to their pizza.  I think he wanted to re-live so childhood or something.  LOL!!I ordered a large supreme and 3 meats pizza.  Then I ordered 2 orders of garlic and parm chicken wings and 1 order of the lemon pepper wings.  So the cashier rung me up and $34+.  I handed him the debt card and he said, oh we can only take cash our machines are not working.  Really, he could have told me before I ordered.  I had to walk next door to Fresh & Easy to buy something so I can get cash back.  =(  The pizza and chicken wings were ok.  I wouldn't get them again.
4	I believe Little Caesars are good for one thing, and one thing only! Cheap Pizza! I don't think I have ever ordered anything else from their menu, so I can't say anything negative about it. We usually get the $5 dollar Pepperoni pizza, this time we also got the cheese one. It is nothing spectacular, it taste like pizza, it is what it is! What I like about this location it's that they have a drive-thru, and this night in particular, the young man that helped us was very friendly and... well, helpful! Good experience.
