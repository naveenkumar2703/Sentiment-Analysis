5	I visited Simple Healings yesterday for the first time and had an absolutely great experience.  The staff was very friendly, the treatments were affordable, and the facilities were just beautiful.  I definitely recommend that you check this place out.
5	I found a Groupon for this place and decided to try it out.  The place is beautiful.  It is a husband and wife team.  They are very friendly and put you at ease.  I had a 90 minute massage.  It was one of the best massages I have ever had.  I would recommend them to anyone.
5	I booked 90 minute massage with aromatherapy, I can tell you I feel like a whole new person now! I feel AMAZING. He worked my muscles and massaged my whole body into relaxation. I feel like a whole new person, I will not go anywhere else. Gorgeous interior and very calming. I would recommend Simple Healings to anybody who is looking for a fabulous massage in a professional & relaxing atmosphere. So satisfied, from the booking of appointment to walking out feeling like a new person. :)
5	My first massage experience and it was defiantly worth it! Bought the voucher off of groupon and Bob did a great job! I will defiantly be back.
