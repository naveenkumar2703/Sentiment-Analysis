5	Jeff has done exceptional service for me over the years and has always been fair and courteous.  He has changed the locks on my rental homes numerous times and I have never had a problem.  He does quality work at an affordable price and takes great pride in his work. p.s.  I think the review by Amanda is for a different A-1 locksmith company (there are a few other A-1 companies that come up when you do a search.) Her comments are very uncharacteristic of Jeff and his company which leads me to believe she wrote a review about the wrong company.
5	Jeff could not be more awesome!  He arrives when he says he will, doesn't overcharge, goes WAY above and beyond the call of duty, fixing every switchplate that he notices is out of alignment or improperly installed.  His prices are extremely reasonable, and he didn't even charge us for a second visit when one job took a long time and he needed a special part for our doorframe.  What a professional!  I've already recommended him to one friend who needed a locksmith for a new house, and will for anyone else who asks.
