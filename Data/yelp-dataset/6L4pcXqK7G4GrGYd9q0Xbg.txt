4	If you don't need to have the newest collection right this minute, the Theory outlet store has a big selection of the very last collection that came out. This is beacause once the full-price boutiques receive their new collection, they will ship out the last collection directly to the outlet instead of having a sale (of course, the boutiques do have big sales, but just twice a year). The outlet store is spacious, nicely designed and looks almost like their boutiques, with tables and racks full of discounted pieces.
4	I am a huge fan of Theory clothes for women so you can imagine how happy I am when I visit any of the outlet stores. The merchandise is about 40-60% off the regular priced items but beware selection is limited especially in the smaller sizes.This location is not too far from the strip (about 20 min cab ride from Bellagio). However, I don't really think the other stores at the Premium Outlets are worth the trip.
4	I LOVE theory! I feel so Jackie O whenever I wander in their stores. Their styles are super classy with clean lines and beautiful cuts. Perfect place to shop when you gotta "Meet the Parents" or attend a super conservative event without looking frumpy. This store was modern, sleek and the racks are placed far enough apart where you won't bump into your fellow shopper. Prices are about 20% less than normal Theory stores!
4	I had a super quick drop in here - and just my luck, they had a super fantastic sale - I picked up a blazer for $129, and the matching pants for $89, and a fantastic shift dress.  It's not often one can buy all three pieces for the price of one pair of pants.  I've been at Theory outlets before, and the deals are often good, but not this great.Might be worth the trip over the holiday season, the sales staff mentioned they had their best sale ever - 15 or 20% the already crazy low marked down prices...Happy shopping!
