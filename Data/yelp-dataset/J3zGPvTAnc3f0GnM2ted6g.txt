4	This is the big Zehrs supermarket in the Laurentian Power Centre.  Zehrs is a local chain that started in Kitchener in the 1950s, and is now part of the Loblaw Companies Limited (LCL) empire.  Being part of the LCL group means that the store carries the President's Choice and "no name" products.  This store is convenient for one-stop-shopping, with a pharmacy, wine store and eyewear store on-site.  The prices are higher here than in the Food Basics or Freshco, but there tends to be a much better selection here than at the discount grocery stores.
3	I just wanted to post a review to say that I was there, and there was a guy (id say late 30's) who was in the self check out and sharted. NO ONE CARED! its running down your pant leg  and not one worker was making no nevermind! REALLY!!!? I had to run as far away from that as possible! I checked out at the otherside of the store. I will never use that self check unit ever! incase you want to know it was the the first one on the far right :) You're Welcome.  They had decent produce, and reasonable prices. 2 fumbs up!(better post something review like)
5	5 stars just based on their baked goods alone. It's such a shame we have none of these in west GTA.Absolute must tries are the apple fritters and croissant donuts
