5	The staff here are very nice. Lauren is our stylist. She just cut our hairs tonight ;) I always have a nice experience here, and always get to have margaritas either before or after at Loco Patron (next door), so I double look forward to my appointments!
2	i thought I loved the place, until I decided to straighten my hair ( I have devilishly curly hair!). My hair was uneven and the first time I got highlights, with the stylist, my hair became brittle and broke off! I am not very comfortable with the receptionist I always feel like she thinkgs she has better things to do, she is chewing gum and rolling her eyes and every question I had to ask. Apparantly asking for an appointment was too big of a deal for her.
5	I know, I know... another salon review from me, but I can't help it. I was meeting a girlfriend at Native New Yorker next door and spotted this very classy salon. Well, I broke a nail over the weekend and I HAD to fix it since I'm super OCD about my nails. I walked in and met SUCH a friendly group of ladies. Judy was my nail tech and worked with my fussiness with no problem. She has been doing nails since the 1970's! Even though it was only one nail, she made it look just as natural as the rest of them and I had a great time conversing with her. They also do hair and waxing here! I highly recommend this salon.
5	Amazing service and the people are very friendly and have so much knowledge and experience.  Highly recommend!
4	I'm pretty picky about my hair, and it's especially difficult since I always go in not knowing what I want done.  I've been in AZ for a year now, and this is the only place I've gone to get my hair cut/colored.  The staff is very friendly, and I've used Valerie every time.  It can get quite awkward if your stylist is stuck with you for 2 hours for a cut and color, and has nothing to talk about.  Valerie is very personable, and does a great job with my hair.  I will continue using this place until they give me a reason not to
