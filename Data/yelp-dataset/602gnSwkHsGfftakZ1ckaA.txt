5	This GNC was convenient when I was searching for a juice cleanse recently. The store seems to be a bit smaller than others I've seen. The guy working on this day was helpful. He greeted me as soon as I walked in the door; after I showed him a picture on my phone of what I wanted, he walked me over to exactly what I was looking for. I like this location better than the one on Camelback in PHX. It seems to be cleaner and the folks more helpful.
5	Pretty typical GNC. Friendly staff and they carry just about everything. This location was a little hard to find at first. But just know that it's close to the safeway grocery store. If your not buying online then this is a great place to pick up health products, proteins, etc.
3	I've never been to a "bad" GNC as their corporate standardization game is pretty tight.Butttt. They have, perhaps, upped the annoying sales pitches w/their associates. Very. Annoying.I ran in for some GNC Lean bars this past weekend. I politely declined when the associate asked if I needed help. I took my box up to pay and he kept on and on about "educating" me on other products to try (along same brand line). I kept on repeating, "No thanks, I'm good". Then the GNC membership came up again - I declined. Again, more spiel on members-only prices. Blah, blah blah. I tuned out. Then, he might as well have crammed down a Women's Only Vitamin down my throat at the counter. I took one, to shut him up. I paid and practically ran out. While I do appreciate his excitement and willingness to help, there is a thing as being pushy/overly sales-inclined.The vitamin chew was horrid, I spit the thing out in the parking lot flower bed. The Lean bars are great though!
