5	A Great company with Great service.  We have been using them for over 3 years and they have responded and resolved several bug issues. Last Saturday I moved one of my daughters toy boxes and found a scorpion underneath. Thankful it was already dead. I was shocked to see it in the house but very glad that the pest control was doing it's job in terminating the threat. Whatever they're doing it's working! I look forward to many more years of Great pest control.

Home Team has greatly reduced the population of scorpions in my area, eliminated gophers, and exterminated every cricket that even looks at my house. The only bug I see from time to time are scorpions, but they seem to be impossible to rid of completely.
