5	Willy Bike Works has bailed me out with an urgent bike repair on more than one occasion, and I've never had a bad experience with their staff. In fact, they've not charged me for labor on some minor repairs on several occasions. Conveniently located right next to the Southwest Bike Trail on East Wash. For minor fixes, they'll usually do the work right away while you're waiting. Frequently have good sales on merchandise, and a great selection of mountain and road bikes for sale.
5	My only source of transportation for the summer is going to be my bike.  I moved back to WI this past Thursday and brought my bike in to be fixed on Friday.   I had a super helpful employee named Sam.  He checked through the computer and told me that they could take it but I probably wouldn't be able to get it back until next Tues. or possibly Wed.  Long story short, I'm going to be living in my final destination in another city and starting work so those days wouldn't work for me.  I explained this to Sam and he told me he would make sure to keep me informed about my situation and he would do all that he could to get it done by Monday.  Needless to say he called me back 3 hours later and told me that he had fixed my bike and that it was ready to be picked up.  I was floored and very much appreciative at the quality of the job as well as the insanely fast amount of time he fixed it in.  Sam, you're the best.  Williamson Bikes & Fitness... THANK YOU!I
1	A friend suggested that I begin my bike search here. Boy was he wrong. Maybe the West Wash location has better customer service, but after standing around bikes for 10 minutes without so much as a "hello" or "can I help you?" I took my business elsewhere - I ended up spending $2K+. My suggestion: Madison has great bike shops so don't waste your time at this place.
