1	Owner is rude and manager Amanda does not return calls.  They owe me $500 for an item I did not pick and they are refusing to issue credit to my credit card or another order I already paid for.  Prices are also absurd and they act like you are a bad person if you ask for a discount when buying thousands of dollars worth of clothes!  Go to Nordstrom Rack, far superior service and prices that are 50 - 80% less than Gregory's!!
5	Gregory's is a woman's heaven on earth.  If you are a woman's woman and love sexy, sensual, beautiful shoes that fit like a slipper, you MUST visit this store!! The staff is fantastic. The girls are able to read your style without you saying a word. Never in my life have I had a complete stranger offer me a shoe that I immediately fell in love with, and was sold without a second guess.  This is my new favorite shoe store, and I don't ever want to purchase shoes anywhere else!
