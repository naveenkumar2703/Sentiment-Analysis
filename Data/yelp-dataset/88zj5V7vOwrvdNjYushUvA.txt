4	This is the "new" Maloney's, or atleast the newest, that I know of. There are other Maloney's peppered throughout the state, in Tempe, Tucson, and Flagstaff. This location is tied with the one in Tempe as my favorite around. In a nice change from the old location, which has since become Mulligan's, this place is huge. It gets slammin' inside but the layout flows well and it never takes more than a few minutes to grab a drink (except on St. Patty's day, which doesn't apply to this review). The laid-back dress code and atmosphere make this a great place to drink in a large group and mingle with fellow bargoers. The games are always on and the pool tables are packed, so get there early if you want to grab a table and shoot.
4	Nice and dark with an authentic (somewhat upscale) Irish pub feel. Lots of TV's make it a good spot to watch a game.I have not had dinner here yet, though the menu looked good. I enjoyed a few cocktails and the lively crowd, a good turnout for a weeknight. Small smoking patio outside.
1	As far as I can tell, no longer there.
