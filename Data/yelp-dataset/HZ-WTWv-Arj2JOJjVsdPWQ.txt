5	Great customer service, and Alex always makes sure my clients are 100% satisfied. My cars will always be coming here for service.  Thank you!
5	As a small has a small business owner I can appreciate great customer service and that is what they deliver at My Car Care Center. They service my entire fleet of vehicles and they offer a great service at a great price! They pick up and deliver and are one of the few auto repair facilities I would trust.
5	At MyCar I have found them to be knowledgeable, equipped to handle all repairs and be honest about what my car really needs to run smoothly.  Alex and his team were there for me when my car needed help.  Since then I have been loyal to their expertise and they have exceeded my expectation with each visit.  I know when I recommend MyCar Care Center I am helping someone get great service for the car.  Unless you're a car mechanic yourself, dealing with a repair shop may require a leap of faith, but not at MyCar Care Center, they are the experts!
5	Alex is amazing.  It's comforting to know someone in the car repair business that is completely trustworthy and knows his stuff.  I was able to buy an older car with confidence as I brought it to Alex to confirm it was in great shape before paying for it.  Great work, Great guy, Great shop!
