5	This is the best restaurant in Vegas.  The food is amazing and the service is perfect.  I especially like the shrimp tempura on the appetizer menu and the funky roll (soft-shell crab).
5	Thank you yelpers for this great heads-up. I visited on my vacation to Vegas and was not disappointed in the least. The prices were not cheap, but much more reasonable than the Strip, and the food really was first-rate. The place was empty when I was there, but the service was very friendly and quick. I loved the shrimp tempura, and the rolls were outstanding too. Didn't try any sashimi, so I won't comment on that. Bill for two was $50 even.
4	They are a little expensive, but the sushi is first rate. Try the Sakitinis, they're ground up Jolly Ranchers with Vodka. Mmmmmm.

1	Recession of '08 has another victim.  Cafe Wasabi is closed.  This is the second time in a month that I've gone to a restaurant with good yelp reviews, only to find that the restaurant is gone, kaput, out of business.
