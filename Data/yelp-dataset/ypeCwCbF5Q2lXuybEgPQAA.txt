1	I went into get a copy of my test and was informed that it would take 7-10 days to get a copy of a test that I DID 7 months ago? Huh? Everthing was fine according to them/result and I offered to wait, until Dr. Mikel was free to review my notes and release them. I was then, told that he might not even get to my chart today.... Geez . Needless to say, I won't be back. But if you have plenty of time to waste, definitely go there.
5	I have been a pt of Dr. Mikel for several years just for my annual care. I just had my 1st baby and can not express how wonderful Dr. Mikel and his staff are. I had a difficult pregnancy, especially during the last 2 months. I was seen 2x a week and Dr. Mikel explained my work situation with his staff. They always got me in on my lunch break, even if they were already booked. Everyone was so compassionate and caring. His medical assistants where there to help comfort me when procedures where done, when my husband could not be there. Dr. Mikel always told me what was going on and did everything he could to ensure a healthy baby for my husband and myself. The hospital care and after care I received from Dr. Mikel was extraordinary. He came everyday I was in the hospital, even though it was his weekend off. I will continue to see Dr. Mikel in the future.
1	While I'm sure this doctor is knowledgeable in his field, he's not that great with his bedside manner. My first time meeting him, he gave me a huge lecture about me taking anti-anxiety medication, which was prescribed a month earlier-that I hated anyways.. He never talked to me about it, just ridiculed me and told me to do yoga. Really? He doesn't keep track of what he tells patients, and what he goes over at each visit- and he uses the electronic medical records which makes it easier.          The last and final visit, I show up about 10 min before my appointment. I had to wait for 45 minutes with no apology or explanation. After being brought back to the room, I can hear him outside the room with his staff talking about his black Friday shopping for 10 min! So weird, and so over it. See someone that actually cares.
1	I can't believe this quack is still allowed to practice medicine. The AMA needs to find out about this guy and discipline him severely, or better yet, take away his license.His bedside manner is not about manners at all. He acts as if he were a god and we found him rude, obnoxious and so cruel as to make the expectant mother cry.Who the hell does this guy think he is?On the day of delivery, he was still short tempered and delivered the baby in such a manner as to bruise the baby's head and tear the mother's vaginal wall. Neither of those incidents needed to have happened.There are plenty of OBGYNs in the valley. Do yourself, and your baby, a favor and stay as far away from this guy as possible. He must be in it for the money, he's sure not here because he's a people person.
