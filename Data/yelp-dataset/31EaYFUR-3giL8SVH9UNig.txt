1	Their freighting is horrible.  DO NOT rely on the date they give you.  I am still waiting for my product, so I can not comment on their product yet.  They have setback my vacation because I used the dates they gave for delivery.  Do not rely on their dates and maybe you will have a better experience.
5	Great service!
5	I am a contractor and I deal with alot of companies selling contractors products and these guys are definitly one of the best ive ever worked with.  I was surprised to see so many women working here, but they really knew there stuff about turf and even taugnt me a new trick.  They have a great selection at the best prices in the valley. I had a big job and I needed the turf immediatly and they had it in stock!  I couldn't believe how much grass they had in stock.  Will defintily be back!
