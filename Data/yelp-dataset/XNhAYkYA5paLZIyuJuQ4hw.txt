4	I only use this branch's drive-thru ATM.  Good and fast, very bright area during night time hours.  Very safe.  Near SR-51 and Loop-101 in the Northeast Phoenix neighborhood.
5	Nice, clean, fast, and always pleasant. Have been using this branch for years and I can't think of a single negative. The drive through ATM is not great for depositing checks but that serves me right for being lazy.
