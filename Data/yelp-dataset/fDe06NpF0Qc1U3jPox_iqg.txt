1	My daughter did a trial class and loved it.  We signed her up and she went to one class and then got scared for some reason and would not go back.  I understand they do not do refunds, but I just wanted to talk to someone about getting a partial refund or credit for my other daughter to do a class.  Even if they didn't let me get a refund or credit, I just wanted to hear from them.  I left 2 messages with people and 3 messages on their machine.  NO RESPONSE EVER.  Just call me please and let   me know either way.
4	The coaches are great! They teach very well and they are a little strict, but that's the way I like it! I want my kids to be great, but not have a coach as bad as Abby Lee Dance Studio!Anyway, I do agree with Darcy's review, they "rarely" ever get back with you via telephone, but then again, if you are a good dance/gymnastic's studio, none of them do. Only the studio's who are medioker will call you back because they "need" your business!I love them but I am giving them 4 stars because maybe they need to hire someone who "only" works in the customer service department and doesn't spread themselves too thin coaching and trying to call people back!
4	My son has been taking classes here for almost a year.  The staff are professional, and really good with his age group.  (He is 3).
