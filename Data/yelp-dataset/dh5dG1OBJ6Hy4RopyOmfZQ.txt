4	I needed a car while mine was in the shop overnight. Now it's hissing and has to go back to the garage, but that's another story ...Anyway, I did some searching of local prices of car rental places not at the airport. I was very surprised at how expensive Enterprise and a couple others were. Then I found this Budget, which is owned and operated by this very nice gentleman named Sam. Sorry I don't remember his last name. He quoted me a rate which was half of every other place I had tried. When I went in, he was very friendly - the process was quick and a pleasure, especially compared with other places. Today I returned the car at noon, fully cogizant that it was going to cost me another day. He very kindly adjusted the price for me a bit and then closed the location to give me a ride to the garage. I don't know anyone who's the sole proprietor who would do that. He went over and above what I expected and with a really friendly attitude. Please patronize him if you need a car - you will be satisfied, I am sure. I will go there if I have to over any other place.

I don't have a dog and if I did have a dog in the car, I would tell him.  There was hair in the back seat but I was never in the back seat nor did I bother to check the back seat.  My wife and I used the car for a weekend trip to Vegas.  Rather than "the customer is always right" routine, the owner decided to dig deeper into me and continue to accuse me.  He got me boiled to the point where I started yelling.  That's how bad it got.  After this incident, I don't think I can justify to go back here again.  It was obvious the owner was in a bad mood but to accuse me of having a dog in the car, that's just insane.
