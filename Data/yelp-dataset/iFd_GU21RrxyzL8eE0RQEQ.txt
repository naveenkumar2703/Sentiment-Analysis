4	Great food. The number of menu options are nearly overwhelming which is good and bad at the same time. Good lunch place and the service has always been excellent.
3	It's a decent place but the food is hit or miss. I've had some great food as well as some really lousy stuff....once my wife sent her stuff back coz it seemed like it was a week old!Ok to try sometime if u r in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't travel much for it.
3	Good lunch spot for engineering grad students/profs. The lunch special (~$8) comes with soup, large volume of food + spring roll. The service is super quick. I ordered Kung Pao beef - wasn't impressed, but wasn't repulsed by it either. Next time, I plan to order something with noodle. I figured that they might do the better job at noodle since it's in the restaurant name. From a quick glance of the menu, seems like they've got, pho, chow main(or chow-fun as it is called in midwest), and rice noodle dish. They even  have hot-pot, which is a favorite of my friend's advisor.
3	I had the salt and pepper shrimp, which comes with a cup of soup and a dessert.  Shrimp was good, plate of about 15, served fried in a peppery batter, with some jalapenos and scallions.  You might not like that they come head-on, legs, shells and all.  Tasted really good, but annoying to eat, thinking - "Do I look like a dumbfuck for picking off the shells?" or "is it dangerous to swallow so many shrimp legs?"  Then again, sucking out that shrimp head gunk presents a dilemma too.  Do you want to look like a nasty slob or not?  I erred on the side of slob.  Burp.  Soup was vegetable broth and cabbage, carrots, tomatos.  Why even bother, just charge me a dollar less.  FAILDessert (which I had to remind the server to bring out - AFTER we got the check, thank you very much) was a thin tapioca pudding, served in a rice bowl with a soup spoon  Nice sweet (some might say cloying) taste, but the watery texture was off-putting.  FAIL
3	A few years ago Nams was one of my favorite restaurants for their quality of food. Now it just seems to have changed, a lot. Nams Fried Rice was my favorite, now it's extremely oily and too soggy. The service is quite poor - my sister and I sat in before a few other groups and they received their food first as we waited 30 minutes.I've eaten here a few times during work, one of the worst things on the menu is Emperors Chicken - I thought it was going to be similar to something of a General Tso's chicken, but it was an entire steamed chicken with fish sauce! YUCK!!! I'm never ordering that ever, again. Recently i've been eating their pho - for take out and dine in and it's been all well. My last dine in experience was the worst. My pho had about a pinchful of noodles and a HUGE bowl of broth & meat.......... pho? really? or is it soup? It's an OK place to go once in awhile.
3	I have a mixed feeling about this place, it took me a while to decide whether to give this place a 2 or 3 stars.I personally don't like this place as much, the foods were so-so but I can't say anything very negative about it either. I have been to this place few times, not because I crave for a good Chinese food or because I love one specific dish, but simply because there wren't many other choices around Madison. That is, when I feel like Chinese foods but don't want to go to Fugu or HK Wok. I prefer to go to a restaurant specialized in one type of cuisine, and I'm always confused what to order in restaurants like Nam's because they have Thai, Chinese, Viet, etc. Why would they do that? I think it's because they don't have any special dish that is their forte. For this particular place, however, always gofor the Chinese and go someplace else for Thai and Viets. The Chinese dishes are decent in general, but the Viet and Thai dishes are mostly dissapointing.So, to end this indecisive reviews, here are my reccomendations on what to order:Singaporean Vermicelli (is this a Chinese dish? I beg to differ), egg drop soup, congees, fried rice, tofu and vegetable hotpot,.. and.. that's all I can think of! Also, try to go for lunch, coz' it's cheaper and more worth it!
3	It's a good lunch. I went there at an odd time and I think I was the only one in there so fortunately service wasn't a problem. I had something pretty simple and it reminds me a lot of Saigon Noodle(on the west side).
3	I go here specifically for the best congee in Madison, IMHO. The yo tiao is hot, fresh, and plentiful. Congee is the ultimate comfort food and a weekend treat. Also like the kimchee wraps. Cowabunga!
2	Pretty Mediocre overall. The service left a lot to be desired. Overall, the food was pretty good, however the chicken was stringy and tough so i'd stay away from that. If you want to eat together, probably not a good choice as the food comes out as it's finished so the gap between the first person to get their food and the last is around 10 minutes. Prices were pretty high for the quality of food.
2	I have to be honest in that the two stars I'm giving isn't really all that fair to Nam's Noodle.I can only eat one dish at this place as I've got a food allergy to onions; knowing full well that onions are critical to taste for a lot of dishes, I try and stick to this one dish. Also because I generally feel guilty if I have to ask to have it removed. With that said, the one dish I can eat here is OK; the barbecued honey pork ribs are pretty solid and have a pretty decent taste, but it's nothing extraordinary.The service isn't phenomenal either; they do what they're supposed to, but they don't really go above and beyond. Also, you have to spend $20 to be able to run a credit card here, so for someone that rarely has cash, $20 is a bit too much to spend on mediocre food.But Nam's saving grace is its traditional-style karaoke rooms. Although a lot of the songs are mostly Asian (and by this, predominantly Korean, Japanese and Chinese), there are American/English songs there as well. And while they're only MIDI-versions of the songs, it still provides a lot of fun if you've got a lot of friends with you.I've got some pretty good memories associated with this place, but it's not somewhere I go to a lot anyways.
2	I ordered Vietnamese fresh rolls and pho.  The pho was okay, it was not the best Pho I've had, and I think it was below par for the midwest as a whole.  I'm starting to think though that Madison simply doesn't have the Asian food thing going...so by Madison standards this place might be a little better.The fresh rolls were not very good.  They were just rice noodles, bbq pork, shrimp, and lettuce.  There was no cilantro or mint, nor any other fresh herbs--which I think is a key ingredient.  Without fresh green herbs, the fresh rolls have little flavor.  I also think the noodles used in the rolls were too big, and there was too much meat.  And the meat (both the shrimp and pork) had been cooked in a sauce that was too sweet.  This made the rolls come across as heavy, starchy, and bland.The pho was mediocre.  I've had worse, but I'd say this is in the lower quartile of pho quality I've encountered.  The broth was heavy on the cinnamon, lacked complexity, and tasted too sweet (possibly because of too much cinnamon).On the side I was given bean sprouts, lime, and hot pepper, but no cilantro and no basil...which in my opinion is essential.  Again, the experience was disappointing.I could be convinced to come back to this place.  It is possible that the chefs aren't Vietnamese and just don't know how to make this type of food well.  But if I came back, I would order something different.  And as it is, this place gets two stars.  I'm no culinary genius, but the mistakes / omissions this place made were VERY basic.  Just use more fresh herbs--that's why I like Vietnamese food, and without that, I'd rather just eat at home.
2	I was a regular at Nam's till they started decreasing their portion size for the same price.  K23 which was the beef pepper steak with rice is my favorite!!!  But this place does not appreciate customer loyalty, so please don't bother going there.
2	Don't really know what they really mean by Nam but it's definitely not a Vietnamese restaurant. The name is quite misleading.The pho is below average but i guess ppl just simple dont have an option in Madison though. If you want to have decent pho/vietnamese foods, you have to go all the way to the west side for saigon noodles. Madison sucks
3	Too salty, otherwise acceptable
2	$20 credit card minimum? EFF YOUThe customer service sucks, they tried really hard to make us pay for their mistakeOnly reason it gets a 2 stars is because I enjoyed their salt and pepper pork and fried rice. All other items are laughable.
4	I come to Nam's quite a bit for very specific dishes.  It is my belief that for asian restaurants in Madison, one has to pinpoint the original ethnicity of the restaurant to get the best food.  The original owner is from Hong Kong and has some vietnamese influence in his life.  With that in mind, I really enjoy the bun, their mi (noodle soups), and their pho.  I know a lot of people complain about the pho here, but I like it for its meatiness, which is not something I find in a lot of the other Vietnamese restaurants in Madison.  The bean sprouts and basil that usually accompany the soup are a bit lacking though.  In addition, their traditional chinese food is pretty good as well (like their congee).  From personal experience, I would not get the americanized chinese food....or the Pad Thai.  This place isn't even remotely Thai.  For the food that I do like, I give it 4, maybe even 5 stars, but for the confusing menu, I have to go with 4
4	Good reasonable place to go get Pho. Everything else is so-so I would have to say. But hey, if you enjoy singing, there's the karaoke.
1	They serve Americanized Chinese dishes, which is strange. My friend got the duck soup. There were tons of bones in it, including little ones. She didn't eat much of it. The prices are also expensive. You can do karaoke here, but it's expensive too. I basically left this place feeling like I didn't get my money's worth. Oh, and they have a credit card limit of $20 so my party of four who wanted to split the check had to pay each other back after charging one card. The service wasn't great either...will not be going back.
5	BUBBLE TEA. Never tried the food!
4	Best BUBBLE TEA in town.  They're a bit inconsistent about the bubbles - I think they may let batches get pretty old before pitching them and making more--as bubble tea fans know, it's ALL in the bubbles.  So while not every bubble tea I have ever had here is awesome, they are still the best in town.
4	As it's name suggests, Nam's Noodle's best dishes are indeed Chinese noodles and Vietnamese pho. There's a good selection here and it is more expensive than most other Asian restaurants, but the food isn't bad. In my opinion, the clutch items on the menu at Nam's Noodle is the Vietnamese sandwiches. Although it's just okay here, I couldn't find this specialty anywhere else in Madison. In addition, I like that this place offers bubble tea (and a semi-full bar well).But even better is the fact that this place has karaoke rooms!! I've actually been a more frequent patron of their karaoke systems than their food. They've recently installed a new system and their software is actually constantly updated and pretty legit, offering the newest English, Chinese, and Korean songs. The owner is pretty nice too and on occasion has charged my friends and I less per hour when there are fewer customers.
1	To be fair, I only went here once a few months ago. It was a Wednesday and not a busy night.  It's near where I live so I was hoping it would be good.  I will have to try it again, but it's difficult to try a place again and possibly have another bad experience when we have so many good places so I will likely wait until soemone I know recommends it.Service was poor.  Took over ten minutes to be greeted while staff chatted at bar and kept going to karaoke area.  Was not asked about refill when water and beer were out.  Food (noodle bowl with veggies) was greasy (not in a good way), salty (not in a good way) and bland otherwise. Area behind the bar was less than clean. I walk by often and do not see many customers, even college kids, so I suspect they still need to get their act together.  Hope they do.  Great location.
3	I've only ever ordered delivery from Nam's, so I don't know how it is in person. Their food is impressive enough to make them a regular in my delivery rotation, but pricey enough that I probably won't go for them more than once a month or so. Their lemongrass chicken wings were the dish that originally sold me on the place, with their surprising and delicious flavor combination, but all the typical americanized Chinese dishes I'd get anywhere else have been at least as good if not better than other places I've tried around Madison. I get bubble tea with every order--delicious and refreshing. My favorite so far is the honeydew milk tea, but I haven't tried them all yet. I tried one of their Vietnamese sandwiches recently, and it was too spicy for my taste, but from what I could taste after picking off all the peppers and still feeling like I was martyring my mouth, it seemed like the meat had a nice texture and the sauce was good...maybe just not my thing. Personally, my go-to takeout places are usually those that give huge portions, so I can justify the price by the fact that they give me yummy leftovers for a week...Nam's isn't like this, and it makes me sad. But it's still good enough to keep going back to, just not quite as frequently.
3	Came here for lunch and had their pho.  It was OK... the broth was really salty and tasted like a lot of MSG.  I didn't think it was anything special.  We were the only ones there other than one other group at about 11:30am on a weekday.  It was packed by the time we left around 12:30.  I've heard their karaoke is pretty good, will probably be back to try that out, but probably not for their pho.
4	Great food! Hot & Sour soup is amazing.  Delivery does take a little long but it's worth it.
4	I like nam's. Their portions are big, so I usually end up taking my food home. I find myself coming here a lot (usually alone lol but that's okay because the waiters are nice). I used to usually just get plain fried rice with some sort of chicken... Usually orange chicken. But now I'm HOOKED on their pineapple chicken fried rice. IT JUST IS DELICIOUS. Give this place a try!
2	Food is great...if you receive it. Ordered three times, first time was fast, second time took 1.5 hours on a Wednesday early evening, third time called after an hour and twenty minutes, they said it was almost here, 45 minutes later called them again, said they'd check with driver...all told, no food was delivered. We won't make the mistake of hoping to eat in the future, but to be fair, if you do manage to obtain food the same day you order it, it is good. Ps - watermelon bubble tea is delicious. Good luck!
5	I have been going to Nam's since they opened, over 10 years ago. This spot was a favorite of mine and my hubby's. The food is tasty and the staff is friendly. My favorites are the Nam's fried rice and the chicken stick noodle (similar to a chow fun). We moved out of the state for a while and upon my return I found that their menu has since expanded and they now have many new yummy dishes.  That being said, I love my tried and true dishes.
4	ONCE UPON A TIME I WAS FALLING IN LOVE, BUT NOW I'M ONLY FALLING APART. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO, A TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE HEART!Imagine a little Bonnie Tyler with an elaborate Korean soap opera taking place in the background. That's pretty much what you get doing Karaoke at Nam's and it's AWESOME. Grab a private room and sing your heart out, cuz this place rocks!
2	Went here with two friends for dinner and we were all disappointed. The dining area is pretty small, but there is a cute little bar. Nam's is in the campus area, so it's not where I usually like to hang out. Thankfully it was a quiet night, so service should have been fine. Should have been...My friends got their food pretty quickly and I expected mine to follow within a minute or two. I sat and waited and waited. A good 15 or so minutes passed and our waitress hadn't returned. Finally, another employee came to ask if we needed drink refills. I mentioned I was still waiting on my pho and he was really apologetic and fixed things. I got my meal and drinks for free. This was the appropriate reaction, and I'm thankful for that particular staff member for fixing things. The waitress was all like "Oh, he didn't get his food?!" and that was a bit perplexing.And while they fixed things and I got  free food/drinks, it doesn't really cover up the fact that their food is mediocre. The pho was very blah and my companions complained about cheap quality of the chicken served. We all just felt very underwhelmed by both the food and the experience.All I wanted was a good pho, and man was I disappointed. Should have went to Ha Long Bay instead.
5	Came here for dinner for the first time. I ordered the beef brisket in casserole. Very impressed with how it turned out. The brisket was very tender and  the flavor was excellent. My husband enjoyed his dish of noodle salad as well. Would definitely go back and try other dishes and bring a few friends and try their karaoke.
1	I really want to like this place, but I've had a bad experience every time I've ordered from them. A few weeks ago, I ordered delivery from Nam's and my food took almost an hour longer than the estimated arrival time. When I finally received my food, there was a curly black hair sitting directly on top of my curry. Luckily, I still had my crab rangoons and I was able to eat those, but I certainly had no appetite for the curry... I called Nam's as soon as I found the hair and was told by the employee that answered the phone that he would "leave a note" about getting me a free entree next time I ordered from them. Well, I just ordered food from them again and received a very rude phone call from one of the workers demanding to know why I was receiving a free entree. Let's just say that I am a little insulted that, after I gave them a second chance, they would call me and accuse me of lying to get free food. Side Note: After being reassured that my food would be here in 45 minutes, it has now been an hour and I am officially never ordering from here again.
3	-----------------------------------------***THE GOOD***------------------------------------------The prices are fair and the delivery arrived ahead of schedule (with an asterisk - see the next section)-The egg rolls are AMAZING. Next time I'm skipping the Crab Rangoon (see "The Ugly") and getting a double order of these delicious rolls!-The Pad Thai was solid (maybe a poor choice of words) - I asked for medium spice and for a Midwesterner I'd say it's a pretty spicy medium but it's nice to challenge your taste buds! I could have used more chicken but overall was very pleased.-General Tso's Chicken - really good flavor and texture. The portion was a bit small so I recommend getting some appetizers.-----------------------------------------***THE BAD***------------------------------------------As I mentioned, I ordered delivery and while the meal arrived ahead of time, it required reheating which makes me think it was sitting out on the counter for a while.-By default, they don't include any soy or sour sauces in the bag (besides what comes standard with the appetizers) so make sure you have everything you need ahead of time!-----------------------------------------***THE UGLY***------------------------------------------My Crab Rangoon order was a complete joke. These were essentially just near-empty fried shells with about half a teaspoon of filling. Skip these and, like I say above, go for the double order of egg rolls. Seriously, these were so empty that I posted a photo of them to Instagram because I couldn't believe my eyes and needed the validation of social media to prove I wasn't missing something.-The coupons on GrubHub that they offer are laughable. An order of $25 or more (excluding tax, delivery, and tip) get's a can of soda? $30 or more is the same thing but with bubble tea as an option? Please. The other Madison area Asian food restaurants offer much better coupons.
4	I come to eat at Nam's noodle pretty often. I like vietnamese noodle salad, Pho, and kimchi fried rice. The service is fine. It tastes good in general.
5	Rap music and Asian food. I might start watching football here.
4	"Can you choose? Just bring us an appetizer and a couple entrees to share."When you start a dinner like that, how can you not have fun?I'm really bad at remembering dish names but I'm pretty sure we had the: lemongrass chicken wings, a spicy Korean soup with seafood, stir fried rice noodles with beef and  xo sauce, and pork belly with string beans. Our server was super awesome, and went along with our nonchalant ordering steez. Wish I had caught a name!-The chicken was da bomb. Light, sauceless, and crisptastic--just what I wanted.-The Korean soup was a little spicy for me and I wished there was more substance with the seafood.-The rice noodles were noms. I mean, it's rice noodles and beef and sauce. It's like basic Asian comfort food, and I LOVE RICE NOODLES!-`There's something nostalgic about string beans. Do people not eat string beans in Madison? Because I definitely never see them on the menu anywhere.Overall, we had good times and there was mad rap and r&b on the whole time and I left with a full tummy.---I also had the avocado bubble tea and it was A+. Fresh avocado smoothie with bubbles and while I usually go sans bubbles, their bubbles made me realize that good bubbles exist in the world!It's chill!It's cheap! (If you're a broke biddy, check them out)It fills you up!I'll mostly likely be back to try more dishes.
4	I have to admit I am quite a fan of Nam's Noodles, so a part of me hopes to bump up their star-rating by writing this review. I know, I know, they serve up dishes from so many different parts of Asia, I wouldn't know how to classify Nam's other than Asian Fusion, and they really live up to that name. I have been a regular since a couple of years back, where a co-worker and I would go every week before our night meetings for dinner. We have tried every item on the chef's recommendation list. They used to offer complimentary soup and dessert with every meal, I wish they still have that now. I remember the soup made for a great appetizer and till this day I still miss some of the desserts they make. I don't think any of that are on the regular menu so that's sad.On that what's good currently! They started with Belly Program, you get 5 points per visit, so it's pretty easy to get enough for a free beer or bubble tea (remember to let them know to reduce sugar levels you are not a huge fan of sweet drinks) using Belly Points. Nam's is another wonderful place on campus for noodles and congee. If you are looking for pho downtown, you can go to Nam's. If you're looking for Korean food downtown, you can go to Nam's. Nam's is a good place to go if you and your dining company are looking for different asian varieties. As for me I love their congee. It's only $5.50 for a huge bowl. Avocado bubble tea is also one of my favs! They make it using real avocado!! For appetizers I especially love the lemon grass chicken wings. Plus I like the fact that I get to just walk down on a day I have 1.5 - 2 hours to spare for a leisurely long lunch =) Do note that they get busy during lunch hours, but you can always call ahead if you're just getting something to go.
4	One the few places that have noodles on campus. Reasonable price and a good variety of Vietnamese noodles and other Asian noodles. Lunch specials are also not bad. Service is good. A good place for an originate meal.
4	Had a lot of variety when it comes to Asian food. I got the kimchi fried rice and it was delicious! I've also had the porridge there and tastes just like how my mom makes it. I saw the menu and they have Pho, curry, along with other Asian dishes! I'll definitely go back and try the other stuff!
3	Came by for an 'eat to bite' (name that movie... answer below) and enjoyed a satisfying pork noodle soup with pickled cabbage and a strawberry bubble drink.The rate at which a dish exits seems a bit slow so dont think youll be in and out in 15 minutes but the food was tasty.So a 3-4 syar rating seems reasonable.Answer: Tom Hanks in The Terminal
