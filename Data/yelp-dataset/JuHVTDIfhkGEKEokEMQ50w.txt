5	This Doctor knows what he is doing. did a rotator cuff repair for me, I feel like a million bucks!!!
1	This was a horrible experience w shoulder surgery. I continued to have problems many months down the line. After 4 mos I called the doc. It took 7 phone calls over 3 weeks to get a call back. This was a call from a post op patient having a problem and he doesn't have the courtesy of a call back. When he finally did, he copped an attitude worthy of a sullen teenager. I must emphasize that I am a very polite, compliant patient and at no time asked for drugs. To boot-I AM A PHYSICIAN. It's not how I practiced medicine.
1	After waiting close to an hour in the waiting room, I get called back and meet the doc.  I had an MRI booked already for the next day. After an exam, he said once the MRI results are in (knee) they call me to book a follow up appt to discuss options on where to go from there.  A week went by.  I called the imaging center and picked up a copy of my MRI results.  Knowing I was not going to go back to this place, I waited another week.  I finally called and asked about if this was normal practice, to not call people back who are obviously in pain!  They responded, 'it's the patients responsibility to call and make their appointment after an MRI.'  How are patients supposed to know when the MRI is sent over??!?!? That's a BIG sign right there.  No thanks.  If you can't even follow up with me BEFORE surgery, I am not interested in having you cut open my knee.  Very poor customer care and service.  "Patients don't care how much you know, until they know that you care!"
