4	Great variety of things to do. A definite when visiting this area.
5	360 Adventures has a huge variety of things to do. Whether you live in the Phoenix area or are visiting, want an extreme adventure or a family outing you should check out their website. They offer everything from Kayaking and rock climbing to Grand Canyon tours. If you want to get out, give them a call and they will set you up with a tour you will always remember. The first tour I did with them was Canyoneering and it was an experience like no other. They even took some great pictures of me repelling off a waterfall! I loved it so much I went back to them to sign up for a hot air balloon ride (a Christmas gift for my mom.) A champagne brunch was included. I have also done the Sedona horse back riding and Sedona jeep tour. All highly recommended.
5	I got engaged in Sedona and I knew my fiancee wanted the moment captured.  I had a variety of requirements for the hike - not too long, beautiful view of Sedona, guide who is a good photographer.  Adventures 360 exceeded all requirements.  Our guide, Lars, was a great guy who possesses incredible knowledge of Sedona.  He took us to  an incredible lookout point and took beautiful photos of the entire hike including the big moment.  He edited the photos and emailed them to me 24 hours later.  I could not be happier with 360 Adventures and Lars.
5	Most definitely hire 360!!  What an AMAZING experience I had with Tony mountain biking today!!! 360 is extremely professional, accessible, and knowledgeable.  Tony catered my ride to exactly what I was looking for. Thank you all so much!!!  I can't wait to go climbing, canyoneering, and horseback riding with you. I'll be back!
