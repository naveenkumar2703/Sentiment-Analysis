4	If you think that the Arizona Canal is the only canal with a great bike/jogging path, you're missing out. The Grand Canal, the oldest remaining pioneer canal on the north side of the Salt River, runs 21 miles from 75th Avenue and Camelback Road all the way to Papago Park. You can take your bike or just enjoy a leisurely walk along the path which, thanks to  the city of Phoenix and the nearby residential developments, is landscaped in some areas (especially near where it crosses Central Avenue). The path is paved in most areas, though in some areas it's a hard-packed dirt path. This is also a great place to go bird watching, as many birds, especially wading ones, are frequently seen along the route.
5	The Grand Canal is a great place to exercise, whether you walk with friends, take running seriously, bike or roller blade (yes, I do see people out there on skates). I love the canal because it's great exercise for me and my pup. We enjoy the stretch from Maryland to 32nd. Beautiful homes along the way, the Wrigley mansion and the Biltmore!Some people have said that the trail can be a little sketchy or unsafe, which I have yet to experience. I stick to daylight hours when plenty of folks are out and about.
5	I cannot see Russa from my house but I can see the Grand Canal.  The Canal runs 38 miles throughout Phoenix and is great for walking or biking.  My dog loves it!
