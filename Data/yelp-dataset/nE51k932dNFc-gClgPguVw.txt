3	I kind of agree with Michael R. below about the overall quality of the Food Fight restaurants.  But I do have to point out that Food Fight is based in Madison, and operates restaurants only here, so it is "local."  As for "independent," well, nine restaurants doesn't make a very big chain.  Ian's has three locations and has overlapping ownership with Gotham Bagels, which has two more; is that not an "independent" restaurant?None of which is to say you should eat at these restaurants.  Tex Tubb's Taco Palace is OK, but there's much better, much cheaper Mexican all over Madison.  Hubbard Avenue Diner serves a pretty good breakfast but disappointing lunch and dinner.  Bluephies is good for kids but I'd never go there with grownups only.  And Fresco actually held up pretty well against its peers the one time I ate there -- way ahead of Cafe Continental and a little behind Magnus.
2	The restaurants that Food Fight offers are all subpar, with one exception of Johnny Delmonicos. Aside from the Johnny D's the others all serve incredibly bad food. I tried El Dorado's once and it was terrible, on top of things they charge so much for a margerita served in a tiny glass its ridiculous.
5	I have been a food fight customer and visit all of there restaurants on a regular basis. My favorite is Monty's blue plate. The meatless loaf of the gods is my favorite. Have tried other things and have always been happy. Every year they sell gift certificates and for every one hundred dollars they give you a twenty five dollar certificate. Can't beat that. I load up a gift card with five hundred and eat all year. I would never agree with the people that have bashed their places. Try it you will like it.
