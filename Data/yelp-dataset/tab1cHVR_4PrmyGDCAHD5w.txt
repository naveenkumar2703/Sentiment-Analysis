3	Ahh @DunkinDonuts you wiley scamp you. I had little to do with you and could take you or leave you until I spent some years in the Boston area.  Then I became hooked on your crack in a cup.For God sakes you were every 1/4 mile on route 1, incessantly beckoning with your caffeinated siren song.So I became accustomed to at least one daily "laahg regulah".Well, I've been in the Phoenix area for 3 years now and clearly you are following me.  In a good way.  So it's actually nice to see you appearing in the far corners of the Phoenix area, @DunkinDonutsPHX .Just don't forget that it's all about the coffee.
5	The kids who were working here when we stopped in for some sugar and caffeine before heading home (our last little stop in our 53 day honeymoon adventure) were super nice and friendly! We didn't expect much from a DD in Wickenburg, AZ, but this was just as good as the ones in Massachusetts.  Maybe even better since the employees seemed happy and friendly!
4	Nothing beats Dunkin Donuts! Treat yourself to one of their amazing coffee drinks if you're driving through en route to Phoenix, Las Vegas or wherever.Friendly workers. I'd be back there frequently if I lived in the area.
3	Was so happy to stumble upon a Dunkin Donuts on my way from Vegas to Phoenix, as I wanted a gingerbread latte.  I got one, but unfortunately it kinda sucked.  Maybe I'm just used to Starbucks version, but I swear the DD one normally tastes better.
