4	Looking for a fast mexican food with all the traditional flavor this is the spot. Me and my family have been going for over 7 yrs:)
2	I hate to give local businesses bad reviews, but this place is fuckin uuuup!Gave this place's menudo a shot while experiencing the hangover from hell on a Sunday morning. The restaurant has a beautiful menudo poster on the window. Large pieces of honeycomb tripe, fresh lime, crushed red pepper and cilantro...To a Mexican with a hangover, there is no better sight!  So I walk inside and order a bowl, about $5, standard price. I take a seat and a few moments later, I'm greeted with a  heaping bowl of hominy and a few shitty pieces of tripe. The red chile was a deep, dark red and looked very old. Shocked that my menudo looked absolutely nothing like it did on the poster outside, I dug around in my bowl, looking for some kind of hope that I would find a mere trace of what was advertised outside. A few panicked spoonfuls of hominy later, I gave up and went next door to Fry's for a can of Juanita's menudo.
3	Decent Mexican takeout. If I want a little more substance than fast food but don't quite have the time to head to a larger sit down place, I'll stop by for an order of 12 rolled tacos to split with my wife and/or a chorizo burrito.
5	Excelentes precios!! Y la comida esta muy rica. La limpieza es excelente y las personas que atienden son muy amables
4	Got the mexican flavor burger. Was great, but all ingredients seemed store bought. Other than that, another good burger.
