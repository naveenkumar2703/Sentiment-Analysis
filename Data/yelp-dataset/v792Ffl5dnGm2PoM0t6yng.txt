3	Funky interior, decent music, very pleasant staff and customers and, bizarrely, Cumbrian dancing being practiced in the back bar. A delightful find.
4	For picking a random pub to listen to some of the music which was being put on as part of the Leith Gala, I couldn't have picked a better place than The Village. Thank you bar staff for not hating the cheapest table ever with one non-drinker on tap water, and 2 on fresh orange, although some more smiles would have been nice - some seemed to be quite bitter with their lot!Otherwise, the music (the music of folk that is, and it seems from the ole interwebs that this is seems to be a folk-music driven pub) was excellent - we did pay our fiver to listen and watch from the back area, but found it much more amenable to sit and chill in the front bar to catch up with an old friend. Definitely the kinda pub I would frequent if I lived in the area. Not sure if it does food. Definitely recommended!
4	Based on my one visit so far, this seems like a nice neighborhood pub. I went on a Tuesday night, and there were about six people, all obviously regulars, drinking at the bar. Friendly, mellow atmosphere. Pleasant noise level, not too loud to have a good conversation. Lots of announcements of community events posted on the walls. The bar has a large back room that apparently is set up for live music (and has lots of pictures of performers on the wall), but that wasn't happening when I was there.They only had one beer on cask (they had a number on tap), but it was unusually flavorful, so I was happy (I'm used to U.S. West Coast IPAs, which tend to pack a lot more punch than what I've been drinking in England).
