1	Save your time and energy and head to the Arrowhead store. My husband and I walked into this store and were totally ignored while it wasn't even busy. The employee at counter was talking about how he is only "faking being nice" to customers. The other employee proceeded to pass by us to help a new customer that just walked in. We had enough and bought our 2 phones at the Arrowhead store which was polar opposite to this place....busy, professional and helpful.
3	Uriel is a fantastic Sprint sales rep here but the rest of the staff I interacted with really need to be trained or replaced.  Why have 4 reps on staff if 3 of them constantly say ask Uriel.  If they had 4 Uriels on staff, I would rate this place 5 stars.  I am a sharp, savy tech buff and I HATE it when people representing technology don't have a basic understanding of the tech items they are selling.
2	Buyer beware. Be prepared to fight often. You will not be told that your bill is due every 30 days, which means a different due date every month. Plus they will put you on the insurance plan, even when you specifically say you don't want it. They will also try to charge an activation fee months after you started your service... out of blue. And of course you will be faced with super heavy non American accents when you reach the foreign call centers.
1	No help.
