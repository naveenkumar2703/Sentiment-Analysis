2	This location doesn't seem to have a good selection at all. All of their comedy, action, and drama movies only fill about 5 aisles in a small little section in the right side of the store. The rest of the store just has video games and an abundance of new releases or movies that just came out in the past year and a half. The employee on duty wasn't necessarily rude, but he was a little annoying. He was helping out the lady in front of me and instead of just telling her things, he would ask her questions like, "You know this is blueray right?" "You know this is rated R right?" I don't understand why he couldn't just inform her, but maybe that's just his customer service style. Since they didn't have the movie I wanted (I'm sure they don't have many of the movies I want), I just left. Luckily this isn't the closest Blockbuster to my house, so I have the option of avoiding it.
