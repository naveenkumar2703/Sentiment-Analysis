3	I registered here a while back. I never been so overwhelmed. Even with my mom, looking at the walls of paci's and bottles was wow. I didn't know the difference between them all,yet, there was so many to choose from. Then you get to the big items: cribs, strollers, carseats. Not a whole lot to choose from. Baby tub, nursery decor, matresses, and changing pads had a small selection as well. They are good everywhere else though. I walked out and went strait home to lay down, I think I only registered for 30 things haha. I was told I am going to need a lot more though eek.
4	The store is clean and the products are easy to find.
2	I like this store, I think I enjoy it mostly because it's also attached to a Toys R Us which we tend to use more these days.  The store is clean but the customer service is simply not there.  And in reality you'll find almost anything in the store at a lower price somewhere else.
2	Babies R' Us is the closest MEGA baby store to me.  We've been in a few times as we are preparing for our first born, and each time I leave I'm overwhelmed.  Everything is overpriced and disorganized.  Many times I can find the same item (car seat, stroller, clothing, breast pump, etc.) for much cheaper somewhere else.  If you live nearby this store, I recommend stopping by to try things out, then searching online or at other stores for the same product.  You'll be shocked at the price difference.  Seriously.Interested in cloth diapering?  You won't find any options here.  For clothing, you can pretty much only find Carters or Babies R' Us brand. I'd much rather drive to Zoolikins, Buy Buy Baby or Baby Town for their variety and prices.
