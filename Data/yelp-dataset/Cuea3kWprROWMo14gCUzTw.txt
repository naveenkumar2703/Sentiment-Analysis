3	***yet again, ANOTHER update***I docked this location one more star, down to three. The man that runs this store seems to follow whatever hours he pleases. I have now driven out to get boba a total of three times, two of which he wasn't even open (during his posted business hours), and the third of which he didn't have any boba ready. What an idiot.  Please don't make me dock you a fourth star. ****UPDATE*****I have demoted Lollicup by one star, sadly. They open at 10 am daily so I thought this morning, "hey, I'll grab the boy and we'll get some boba after work this morning". So I run home, grab they boy, and we make the trip to Avondale for some delicious milk tea. We get there around 10:10, I can hardly contain my excitement as I run up to the counter, "two boba milk teas, please!"....only to hear, "Oh, no boba right now". *jaw drops* "WHAT?! are you out? what's going on?""No, no, it's still cooking""...oookay, when will it be ready?""At least 11""ELEVEN?! Are you serious?!""Sorry.."Okay, HUGE letdown. Seriously though, why the hell do you open at 10 when your product isn't ready 'til 11?! Why can't he start making it an hour earlier? I just don't understand this. At all. And I was super pissed cause I spent like $5 on gas and went home empty-handed. Seriously. Seriously. Oh! They're also closed on Mondays. So if you're in the mood for some boba, make sure it's Tuesday through Sunday AFTER 11 am. *******I've already put in my two cents about Lollicup and how wonderful their boba is. HOWEVER, I just discovered this location and it's 8 miles closer to my house than the Chandler location. Hello BOBA!
1	For right now I would have to rate this specific store as a one star. I have driven out there 5 times during business hours and the store was closed. I called today at 8pm, but no one answered the phone. I'm not sure what the hours are for this place and it's frustrating when they are not open when they should be.
4	This is definately out of the way for me but I still make it a point to drive all the way to avondale just to get a cup of honeydew slush with boba, they do have quite a bit of selection as far as flavors go and you can choose different flavored jelly. it's kind of quiet and makes me wonder why it's still open but then again i never go in and sit i always take my drinks to go. overall it's a nice little place with good drinks and toast (strange i know)  oh and my little sister loves this place I am not allowed to go there without her she is 8 so i'm assuming all the kiddies love this.also I do believe they only do cash so be prepared because there is only a bank of america bank in the plaza
3	I first discovered Boba at a place in Tempe called Aurora Espresso.  Unfortunately, that place no longer exists, but Lollicup is a satisfactory replacement.  The tea and boba are great, well worth the trip when I am in the mood for boba.  The jelly and pudding are also quite good, but I enjoy the boba the best.  The smoothies are also good, but I usually avoid them with boba, as it hardens and is not as good.  I also like the stamp card, as I like to make multiple visits.My complaints with this place pertain to some logistical things.  First off, not having the ability to use my credit card is frustrating at times.  Also, there have been times when I drove all the way over there during business hours only to discover they are closed, that is quite irritating.  Realistically though, it is still a great place to get some boba tea.
4	Best place for boba that I have found in the area. I love the spicy chai tea with boba. I will drive 20 minutes to get this drink. Yum!  They are closed on Mondays and boba is not always ready when they open in the morning.
1	CLOSED! Out of business
1	CLOSED. I wanted to try this place. I planned and look forward to it all week. I arrived at the place to find the sign ripped down but the stuff still inside. The landlord here must be a real peach. Everything I love in this shopping center leaves. Property is always Being locked away. Next pay period I guess I'll try Chandler. I love Arizona. *gag*
