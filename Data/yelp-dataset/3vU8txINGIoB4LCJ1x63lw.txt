1	Legacy Suites is an 'average' hotel that would be fine... unless you want to sleep beyond 7 am or get internet. They only have internet in the lobby, so unless you get a room within 100 feet or so of the lobby, you won't get any internet. Worst of all, they have the gardeners show up at 7 am with leaf blowers and lawn mowers. When I complained, they simply said that is the time that they contracted with the company to show up. They do this on purpose and know about it. It was not simply a one time oversight, but a known problem they choose to not have fixed for the comfort of their guests. So saving money on gardening is more important to them than your sleep. The free coffee in the lobby is terrible too, and they only have the powdered creamer instead of the little cream packets. Yuck.  I will never go there again.
1	Let me just say, I had a loaded gun in my room and within reach at all times. I was afraid to go to the fitness room and someone offered to sell me morphine at the pool. This place is scary. The room was nothing special, not the worst but not even close to the best I've been in. You pay extra to have sheets and towels in your room. We went to Walmart and bought our own instead of renting the nasty linens that were here. We asked to have the bed replaced, about six times, and someone came to the room and pushed down on the corner of the mattress and said he would see what he could do. I never heard anything else about it. My advice, look somewhere else. The other Legacy Suites is even worse. This is a scary neighborhood.
1	I felt like I was staying in a "crack house".  Would never stay there with my kids.  The mattress was so loud and creaky, I couldn't even get any sleep.
