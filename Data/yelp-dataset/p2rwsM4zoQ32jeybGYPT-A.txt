1	ER was slow... Checked in at 3:00pm and left with no doctor visit after 5hours. Ppl being seen before me were in there for hours! And only 3 people got to see the doctor with in that 5hours. I don't know how long they've been waiting either.
1	Horrible customer service. I'm shocked how they employ people who have such limited vocabulary and no common sense. Horrible attitude from the front girl "Lucille". Showed no effort in helping or listening to anyone. I did see her chuckle away every time she glanced at her phone. I assume her texting or Facebook was much more important than injured people seeking help. The gentleman sitting next to me has a broken finger and he's been sitting here since 11am ( 7 hours ago ). I'm heading to another hospital and giving this gentleman a ride to get seen.
3	I am not a Native American.  I've ended up spending a huge percentage of my life among Native people.  I've spent hundreds of hours in this hospital, many of them waiting for intake via the emergency room and the triage procedures practiced there.    If it weren't for the Phoenix Indian Medical Center, my sister-in-law would not be alive.  Among seven or so medical facilities in a period of three years PIMC provided her the most compassionate and best overall care of any of them.  Thank you PIMC.
3	I'm here with family in the ER for high blood pressure . Same as usual slow..but I will say if it is an emergency they will send you back faster at least. But you will still be there until late at night.
