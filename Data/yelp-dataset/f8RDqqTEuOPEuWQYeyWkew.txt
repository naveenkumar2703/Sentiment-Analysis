4	Not bad. I mean it's a national chain so it's pretty baisc stuff. But compared to other pizza nearby, I get my pizza here.
5	This is the best chain pizza in Buckeye!
5	By far the best pizza in town!! Drove an hr just to get a pizza from here!! And let me tell u it's worth it! It's literally better ingredients better pizza!
3	Un fortunately this is the best pizza in the area.  Just had it tonight because the dbacks won yesterday so it's 50% off here.  Chicken poppers were good tonight.  Not great food but not terrible food either.  Good for half off
4	Not a bad papa john's and is super hard to beat the value and have specials all the time.  I regularly get  2 2-topping pizzas for under $15
