5	I absolutely love this place.  I've been eating here since it was down the street a little bit in a small 10 table shop.  Another one of my favorites for lunch.  I eat there at least once a month.My favorite dishes are:Garlic Knots - A must have for anyone who eats here.  Think pizza dough with butter and garlic tied into a knot.Pizza - I like the 2 slice cheese lunch special when I'm in a hurry.Baked Ziti - Unbelievably good.....large serving.  I definitely need a nap after eating this dish.I take clients and friends here whenever possible.
4	This is such a quaint little Italian deli, the counter is so cute and there is so many things to choose from! I highly recommend this place especially if you have cravings for good east coast Italian food. Although these guys have been here a while, they have not strayed from their roots.The garlic knots are to die for, I don't live on that side of town so I absolutely gorge when I go over here. Must go to gym more often so I can eat more Montesano's!
5	This place is the only reason why I miss living in Vegas.  It's myf avorite italian joint in the whole wide world.  They have the best pizza, lasagna, everything!  The deli rocks and the desserts are so delish!  I miss this place so much!!!
5	It's been 3 years & I'm still thinking about the last time my taste buds did the happy dance while snarfling down yeasty salty garlic knots & gorging on velvety epiphanous baked ziti (How else would you describe tender ziti bathed in a creamy, tangy, garlicky ricotta marinara sauce?  That's right, I'm pretty certain some minor deities were involved.).  Sigh.  Not to mention inhaling the chocolate chip & ricotta-filled cannolis from their in-house bakery.  Oh & just in case you're curious, their toothy old school deli sandwiches are nothing to sneer at either.  Sigh.  [drool]Yup.  I'm so far gone that I'm actually contemplating a trip to Lost Wages just so I can root around in a ziti-garlic-knot-cannoli-induced haze.  I wonder if they use FedEx?  Or even better, is there anyone in Las Vegas willing to negotiate a food exchange program?  Could I interest you in some tapas http://www.yelp.com/biz/toro-bravo-portland#hrid:5encXDc9LaFfQjKnfRwFoA or Marine Stewardship Council certified sushi? http://www.yelp.com/biz/bamboo-sushi-portland#hrid:T6h06m_n3mj__NJrPGIhIQ  How 'bout a Tom Kah cocktail? http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-observatory-portland#hrid:B4LA344HygZL0hk-SKfg1A  Don't decide now, just have your people get back to my people.
