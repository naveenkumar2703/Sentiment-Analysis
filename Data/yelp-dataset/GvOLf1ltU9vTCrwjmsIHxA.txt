4	This Ross store has been my go-to store for the last 5-6 years... since they open. Very close to my house, no need to travel farther to find the same chaotic scene at the toy aisle.It is very well stocked, but just like any other Ross store, you have to go through every single item on the rack to actually find the correct size on the wrong hanger size. I've always loved the little gems I've found in the kitchen utensils section, you never know!! Some days are better than others, one day the store looks very clean and organized, and others it's just a mess on the floors. But I guess it is not the store's fault but the clientele. I always try to pick up the toys from off of the floor just so that I can pass, but other people don't care, they let their kids go crazy. I've heard the staff members over the sound system ask the parents to keep their little ones by their side... they might think it's the play area at McDonalds or something!
