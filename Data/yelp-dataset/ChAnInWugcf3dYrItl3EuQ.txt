3	Set at the very top of the castle in the castle square, I found this little cafe the perfect spot to take a breather after working my way up the castle seeing the sights.It's set in the Queen Anne building, hence the name.It's rather small, with a normal dining room in the front followed by a second dining area in the back with a glass ceiling/skylight which definitely makes for a better dining experience.  Kitchen closes at 3, though sandwich items are available until 4.Prices are a little high, but then again this cafe's business is all tourists so it works.Order the special: half sandwich, soup, and crisps... seems to be the best deal.
3	Good view to have lunch if you are need of a snack while touring Edinburgh Castle. Definitely get in early as they pretty much only have the undesirable sandwiches left for you to pick on if you miss lunchtime. However, the have pretty good desserts to choose from and that is what we did. The carrot cake was damn good as was the strawberry tart. So coffee or tea with a sweet while overlooking the city from up high was a nice finish after touring the castle.
3	Popped in here to get out of the cold. But it was actually quite sweet. There's a cake table where you can choose a dessert with your tea. Or have a warm soup with bread. I enjoyed my Tea and scone. Seating is all interior. I got some shots of the sunroof room. Afternoon tea is served here too.
