4	This is a Starbuck's concession in Von's. Similar to all the Von's Starbuck's it is a conducive spot to relax. Never a problem waiting on a table. The tables are spacious. And the Starbuck's coffee on the table hits the spot.
4	Kristal might be the barista to make me take back all I have said about every Starbucks being the same. She made my Venti Iced Americano exactly the way I like. It was strong, dark, and had a generous amount of ice which would melt down when the espresso hit it. Instead of just loading my drink with water and a little ice, she did it the right way for beverage with the strength to keep me going for the rest of the day.
2	The girls are great, but their scheduling leaves a lot to be desired. Standing here at 7:45am and there's only 1 person working and 4 people in line.
3	Very friendly staff! My drink always tastes great and exactly as I ordered it!
