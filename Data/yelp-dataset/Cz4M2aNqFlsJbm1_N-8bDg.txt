5	La Tradicion is in a grubby strip mall, even looks a bit seedy to my taste. Deep on the east side of Las Vegas, I consider this a little hidden gem. I guess I am adventurous and enjoy meals cooked by the people who are really from the dish's origin. Well the chili verde plate I had was nothing short of spectacular. The pork was about the tenderest most flavorful ever. If you want an adventure, step out and give this one a try. I liked it a lot! It will really help if you Spanish is above average.
5	I have only had tacos from here.  This is a restaurant but at night they also sell tacos outside.  I don't know if they do this during the week or only the weekends.  I have always gone on weekends.  This is one of my favorite taco spots in Las Vegas along with Las Taquizas on Lamb and Bonanza. My husband also loves these and he is soo picky with his food.  The meats have soo much flavor and are tender.  They have a condiment section and you can add any of the selections on your tacos.  They have a green salsa that is very good but super spicy.  The first time I had it my nose was soo runny lol.  I hope you guys give this place a try!
