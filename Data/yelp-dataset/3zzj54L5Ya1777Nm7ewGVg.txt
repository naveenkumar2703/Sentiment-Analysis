1	DIRT PIT.  If I could give them a zero I would.  Thanks to them I'm fighting a moth infestation in my house.  Their dog food is all contaminated...especially Pro Plan.  I contacted them about it and barely heard a peep from them.  Tried them again on a follow-up visit and the moth infestation was worse.  Even upon returning contaminated dog food I was getting swarmed with moths.  TERRIBLE.  Stay away until they do something about this place.
3	I have been going here for grooming and dog and cat food since before the store moved to Riverview. I always had a good experience until the last couple months, when the grooming department starting losing my appointments. The first time it happened they went ahead and took my dog anyhow. The last time (2 weeks ago) they sent me away, saying my appointment was on the 25th of February. So this morning I call to make sure my appointment was scheduled and guess what?! I was not in the computer AGAIN. They did go ahead and make me an appointment and I spoke to the manager for the 2nd time and she gave me a 50% discount on the grooming, but this is a huge issue for me. So I read some Yelp reviews on some family owned grooming places in Mesa and will be trying one out next time. Good-bye Petco grooming.
4	My husband and I went here over the weekend to get fish and more aquarium supplies.  The (new) girl that works there, I wish I could remember her name, but she provided excellent service and I appreciated how she took her time to help us out with all of our questions.  She is very knowledgeable :)
5	Very friendly customer service in grooming  , Jamie did a great job with my puppy , I will be bringing my dog back .
