2	I'm from NY and have only found a few places that come close. Just bought my house by this place so one Saturday morning we decided to try it! Waste of $! we spent $34 for lunch, my wings where under cooked and slimy and had feathers in them! Mozzarella sticks where not even cooked all the way! Will not go back!
1	We ordered delivery and was greatly disappointed! Chicken fingers were horrible and my Philly steak was soggy and nasty.  When I called back to complain staff was very rude and said no one ever complains and that is what a Philly is.  She was a major bitch and has no idea what customer service is.  I hope they are out of business soon!
