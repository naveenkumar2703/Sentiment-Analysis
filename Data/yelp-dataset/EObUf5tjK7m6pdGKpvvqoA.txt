1	I love going to Payless to get shoes. I try to match my shoes with my outfits, but this particular store does not always have what I need. I have to go to other payless shoe stores or other shoe stores. Occasionally I will find what I am looking for, but majority of the time when I do go, I walk out empty handed. Yikes!

No, I wasn't followed around the store like I was going to steal something. Star #2: The aisles were clean and easy to navigate through. Star #3: When I did need assistance, it wasn't a hassle to get help. Star #4: I'm a big girl with big feet. And it is very hard to go to any store and see a decent selection in size 11. This location actually had a decent selection in sizes 11, 12, and up. I couldn't believe it. Last week at work, I told one of my coworkers that she smelled good and told me she got her perfume at Payless. I couldn't believe it. So while I was there, I smelled a couple of their testers and they all smelled pretty good. If I hadn't just restocked on perfume I probably would have picked up a couple of bottles at BOGO 50%.

No stress about scuffing them or wearing them out since I paid less than I would have at a  higher end shoe store. This location is clean and well organized. The staff has always been pleasant,courteous,and helpful. The only downfall for me is the small selection of my size 7 shoe. It doesn't even take up an entire side of an isle- I have tried to squeeze my feet into 6 1/2 but it just wont' work. So often times I order online and then the items are shipped to the store for easy pick up.
