4	Taco Bell what??!!! Those two words aren't even in my vocab when it comes to this place!! Great authentic Mexican food at good prices and open 24hrs!! Love the rolled tacos and the California Burrito is too good for words!! Tamales are the best you can get if you can't wait til your best friends Latin feast at their house during Christmas:-)
2	Ghetto @ROBERTOSINVEGAS right off Twain & Swenson.Same menu as every location,same food sadly. Myself I like Ground Beef to be like a seasoned maidrite not Shredded Pot Roast with NO flavoring.TOO Greasy and bland for my tastes!!I prefer Victors next door
5	Great food, one of the better Robertos in the valley. Meat is cooked on the spot as opposed to being pre cooked like other places are known to do. The food is great overall, with every item having a distinctly different taste from the others in the chain. Definetely worthy of 5 stars.
3	Came here on a Sunday after a long weekend in Vegas, im sure we all know how we feel on those Sundays after these "type" of "long" weekend in Vegas haha.I needed something oily greasy and Mexican to eat haha so this was the right place. The Horchata was not only refreshing and delicious but above average. I understand that the way Horchata is liked can be totally subjective so just as an FYI i love mine extra gritty however not to sweet. (sounds like my last relationship)The rolled tacos were also very yummy. Burrito was a plus too!
