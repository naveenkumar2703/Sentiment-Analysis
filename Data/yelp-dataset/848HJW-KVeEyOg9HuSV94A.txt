5	This place is hardly hidden! the bright neon lights will scoot your shuffle in a hurry through the door if your not careful. I especially like Dion's services. Whenever I feel bushy-centric I have that artist do a new number on my "do". I have never gotten so many compliments on a twisty landslide like that since before I was married!
4	This was a good experience for many reasons...I took my 15 year old brother in there to have a facial and they were good with him, and educated him on skin care. It was fairly priced... it did not have all the bells and whistles of a fancy resort spa... but I don't always have all day to hang out and enjoy what they charge.A clean comfortable facility... it had a plush feel to it, but still a nice medical clean aspect.
5	I had a great facial at Mozaik! My skin looked and felt so hydrated.  Excellent customer service.
5	Ti is AMA-ZING!  It's hard to find a good lash tint gal and the tint lasted me 4-6 weeks.  Comfortable and in an upscale spa. Enjoy!
5	I was there for their Rhonda Allison Signature Event on July 31 and was thoroughly impressed with the atmosphere and professionalism of all the employes there.  The chair massage was amazing and my friend was very pleased with the aesthetician there.  I would highly recommend Mozaik to anyone that I know.  Prices were very reasonable too.
