4	A cozy little community library that's oh-so-close to home.  It's pretty small when compared to the other libraries, but I like it that way.  The employees are really nice and helpful and like to chat about the things you are checking out.Don't expect a large selection, but it's a nice place to go study or have a community meeting.  It falls under the North Las Vegas Libraries, so it follows a different schedule than the rest of the Vegas libraries.Right next to the Discovery Park.
1	I an a mother of a 2yr old. and i make my daughter learn at an early age that education is IMPORTANT. i use to attend toddler time at the WINDMILL location and they are amazing. i attended library time for my toddler at this location and it was terrible. They provide service for toddlers, a time for learning. and those who are parents should understand the importance of educating your children the right way. this place was not structured for a place to learn. the "story time" teacher was terrible. NOT A PLACE TO BRING KIDS TO LEARN AND TEACH BEHAVIOR SKILLS
2	The facility is clean, and well kept. However, the selection is really small, and the very few study areas offer no privacy at all whatsoever.  I found the library to be pretty loud, as there was a large number of mothers with their kids.  The "quiet zone" tucked in the corner does very little to shield the noise.  Also, there aren't any outlets in the seating areas, in case you want/need to study with a laptop.
