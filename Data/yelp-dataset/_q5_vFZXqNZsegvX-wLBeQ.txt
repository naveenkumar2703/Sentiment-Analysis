4	Freshly opened on Portobello High Street, Annie & Belle is part cafe, part gift shop, exuding considerable charm across both aspects.Overall, we said: "Annie & Belle is a completely charming little cafe. I can see it being a real success over the coming months and years. We'd recommend you go along, try the soup, and, when you have a little more time than we did, succumb to temptation and let your tastebuds run riot with their cakes."
5	Amazing afternoon enjoying some homemade sweets and great coffee! Would highly recommend this friendly cafe as a place to visit.
4	Unfortunatly this lovely cafe is now closed :(
