5	I think Crabby Joes is a great family restaurant and has an awesome  atmosphere I started with the bar its a sports bar at its best ,and the owner is a halves fan I'm not going to hold that against him. They have beer on tap and in the bottle. The waitresses are top notch  The menu  is great not only in variety but quality and value. I recommend this place a must see
4	Crabby joes is the perfect place to grab some drinks and good pub grub with family or friends for lost occasions. They're exactly what they say they are and provide it perfectly. If you're in the mood for solid pub grub and wet beer you're in the right location! If you're looking for a perfect steak and some wine go else where, and fret not they'll tell you the same  Crabbys has long become the "go to" after hockey for drinks and a bite!Specials: Tuesdays are cheap wing night and every night after 9pm 1/2 price apps! You can't go wrong there
1	Came here tonight at 9:30 during the first stanley cup game. The restaurant was NOT busy, and all the wait stuff were extremely rude. We were not greeted by any staff for a solid five minutes. They were unorganized and not communicating to each other clearly. And when we were addressed we were told we could not even be seated for "a bit of a wait." After asking three times what "a bit of a wait" was, we were informed it would be at least 15-20 minutes. To be seated. In a restaurant that had over 50% of it's tables empty. We offered to seat ourselves and were declined. They did not want our group of seven in their restaurant. I understand stress, and customers and etcetera, but it doesn't excuse customer service and professionalism. Very unimpressed with our reception here tonight. Won't be coming back here ever again. I wish a manager had been there tonight to report his/her employees.
