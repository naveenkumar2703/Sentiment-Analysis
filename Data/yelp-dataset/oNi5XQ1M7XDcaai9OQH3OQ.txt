2	The bank's setup is much better then the former Washington Mutual, but it still seems very "cookie-cutter" with a focus on financial services.
4	I have been to this Chase location multiple times in the past few months due to purchasing a home. While I am not doing my mortgage through Chase, I do bank here and needed bank statements and documents notarized. Every time I've gone, the employees were quick to greet me and ask what I needed. If they couldn't help me, they would direct me to the correct person. Every time the employees were friendly and courteous. I was able to get in and out relatively quickly and always with exactly what I needed. This was a great experience. I have also used this bank as a quick ATM (which is inside) or as a quick deposit through the drive thru. My wait has never been long and I like that. The employees know what they are doing and are able to help customers efficiently.
4	Great bank location in a busy shopping center off Loop-101 and surrounding Best Buy, Home Depot, Staples, and many other shops.  Only been here few times and always a happy customer.
