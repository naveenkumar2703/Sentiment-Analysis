4	This is a nice property with nice rooms.  Located next door to Denny's, the gym, Starbucks, and some restaurants.  This is a timeshare joint, with a small fitness room of its own, mini golf (which is a joke), 2 pools, and a hot tub.  Free continental breakfast during the week, with the addition of waffles on the weekends.  They provide a shuttle which goes to the Strip (about 2 miles), which I have never used.  Minus 1 star for the unprofessional front desk people.
4	**Great cheap alternative to Vegas hotels (if you're not a gambler)**First off, there is no gambling at this Vegas establishment. If that's a major concern for you, stop reading now. That being said...-The place is immaculate and the staff are helpful and easygoing.-The concierge service is top notch and provided me with a gift bag upon my arrival and passes to various VIP passes to some hot Vegas clubs (example: Pure). On top of that, they offer rental service through budget for dirt cheap which I suggest being that you're off the strip.-The pool is open 24 hours but they do have request quiet time from 10:00P-7:00A.-My only gripe was that the hot water in the shower doesn't get a hot as I normally like. But then again, I take steaming hot showers.I'd definitely stay here again but I have a couple of disclaimers for other travelers. This isn't a Vegas hotel, this is a time share and they will offer you to go on a tour of their new facility. It's purely optional. But...I went and bought a vacation package. :)Additionally, don't expect the typical hot Vegas skirts and heels in this place. It's a family type spot. Party somewhere else, and crash out here when you stumble on in the morning.
4	I came here about 2 weeks ago for a mini vacation with some friends. I was a Vegas Virgin at this point and had no idea where this was in location to the strip. But that didn't really matter as this place was so great we hardly left!The weather was so nice we stayed poolside for 3 days! It wasn't very crowded so getting a spot at the pool based on where the sun was, was very easy (read...we moved when the sun shifted). There are 2 pools both with sand bottoms (only the kiddie end). The pools were warm which was a bummer because I was so hot I would have liked to cool down. There was a wading pool with a waterful which seemed to be the popular kid hangout...i stayed clear from there! Also the hot tub was pretty sweet as well.The rooms we had we nice. The beds were comfy. We had a suite, so we had a full kitchen, living room area with pull out couch, 2 large bathrooms and 2 bedrooms. It was perfect for us! The location was ok food wise. Tahiti is located next to a strip mall, so we were able to get denny's for breakfast, Qdoba for lunch and walgreens for snacks. However...no liqour stores!!!! The staff was super friendly and gave us a welcome package. There is also a shuttle that drops you off at the strip but stops running around 11:00pm. Cabs from here to the strip run about $15.Overall I would come back here. Its serves it purpose and we all left pretty happy!
5	My friends and I were there from 6/4 to 6/6 to celebrate my b'day.  We reserved a Master Suite which is basically a 2 bedroom.  Which in all my searching they offer the cheapest 2 bedroom near the strip, hence why I made reservations there. When they say they have a full kitchen, they literally mean full kitchen.  They had everything down to a strainer and a wine opener, so no need to bring your own. I liked that it was a bit off the strip but close enough where it wasn't an arm and a leg to pay for a taxi.  I think we paid $15 to go to the ARIA.  We spent all Saturday at the pool and we used their gas grill to have a barbeque. I loved having a barbeque! People are still talking about how much fun they had. They also have jet tubs, which is awesome after walking around in high heels all night. The only bummer is that check-out is at 10 a.m. which is pretty darn early for Vegas.  We got a late check-out for 11 a.m.  Overall great experience.  When we go back to Vegas we'll definitely stay here again.Tip: If you end up staying here and take a taxi make sure you tell them that its the 'Tahiti on Tropicana Ave.' or else you may end up at the Tahiti Village like the couple we travelled with.
3	The pool is good, service is fine, and rooms well kept Overall It's a nice place to stay.Here come some of the surprisingly bad reviews. It's the year 2010 and they still want to charge their guests for logging onto their Wi-Fi! Are you kidding me? McDonald's down the street offers FREE Wi-Fi. Also they want to charge us to use the pool table. I hate to complain about free stuff but the continental breakfast was a small pre packaged muffin, water and/or coffee.  Come on Tahiti I want to praise you as a fine resort and want to nickel & dime your guests like we're staying at some shady roach motel.The Tahiti is a fine place to stay, it's just to bad they feel they need to charge extra for common hotel services.
5	Absolutely loved it!  This will definetely be our spot when we go to Vegas from now on.  The check in time is 4pm, we arrived at about 2pm.  We asked if we could check in and he said we could, but it would be a $25 fee.  That was the only thing that I would change.  The hubby and I were in the studio with a king bed. The room was spacious for us.  Our room had a kitchenette - mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, toaster and sink.  It was also stocked with plates, bowls, glasses and utencils.  The bathroom had a nice whirlpool, I made use of it after a night of dancing!  We used the complimentary shuttle, which was nice.  The driver was nice and very informative.  The shuttle brings you to NY, NY and Treasure Island.  However, if you want to go to TI, you have to wait for the shuttle at NY, NY that goes to IT.  We liked being off the strip away from the hustle and bustle.  It is on the west side of Tropicana.  The property was quiet and well maintained.  and the staff was nice and friendly.  We went to the pool and enjoyed it.  It wasn't that crowded so it was easy to find a spot.  The pool and hot tub is open 24 hours.  If our stay was longer, we would have grilled up some steaks too!  Walgreens and Dennys is just next door along with a gas station and In n Out down the street.  We can't wait to stay next year!  Hopefully the rate will be in the same price range.  We paid $55 dollars and night and was by far the best bargain!
2	Wait a darn minute!  I thought it was called 'Tahiti' but I felt like I was in Cuba?!  What gives?  Wait... I'm being punked... Wait. No? GrrrrrMy buddies and I wanted to go to Vegas for a few days and my friend said he had a 'Time Share' that we can use.  We thought GREAT!  Let's book it.  So we did.We get there and the only thing that looked like it was from Tahiti was me!  Well, I'm of Mexican decent but I think I can pass for a Tahitian.Overall it's your average looking hotel.  Like Yelper Myles B. said in his review "It's about the same {quality as} a Ramada inn"My complaints:The 'free breakfast' in the morning are prepackaged pastries, and assorted mini muffins.  To drink you have a wonderful choice of Water/OJ/Grape Juice.No Housekeeping for the 5 days we've stayed there.Often confused by taxi drivers with "Tahiti village" (we got dropped off there when we go off the airplane and told then guy)I had a hard time operating the AC and it kept blowing in my face when I slept on the sofa/bedOh... The beds!  I didn't have an opportunity to sleep on one because I'm the youngest and I sacrificed the older ones to have the beds.  The sofa bed had to be once of the worse ones I've slept on.  So I ended up just sleeping on the sofa without pulling out the bed for the rest of the trip.My praises: The staff was ALWAYS helpful and nice.  :oD To bad they can't change the look/feel/comfort of this place.  Nevertheless, they were awesome in pointing me to the right direction and giving me great Vegas tips.  This place is about 3 miles away from the StripCheers and Relax Responsibly!
4	My husband and I stayed here for the Memorial weekend. It's a good thing we stayed here because traffic was hell on the strip. This hotel is located approx 4miles off the strip, away from all those cars and crowd. We were able to take smaller streets to avoid EVERYONE.The front desk and concierge were very friendly. The studio room we got was pretty clean. The jet tub looked clean but we soaked the tub with hydrogen peroxide. No fizzing, which I guess is a good thing, right? Well better to be safe than sorry! BTW.. we used it each night of our stay. =DThe hotel was also very quiet. Which is great because we won't be disturbed during sleeping time! =DAlso, there's 3 pools for kids to enjoy. Unfortunately, that's all I got..we didn't spend much time in the room! =POn a side note...The whole feel of the hotel sort of reminded me of Cancun Resort in LV..
2	We mistakenly booked this thinking it was the Tahiti Village resort in Vegas. Though this place was fine as just a hotel, note that it is away from the Strip (that can be a good thing) and not a resort at all.No restaurant there. No bar for drinks. A very minimal continental breakfast (not sure which continent it was based on - not North America)  I found myself walking next door to the Denny's and the Starbucks a bit too often. The pools are small but okay.They do have an hourly free shuttle to the strip but depending on what part you're headed for and if you're trying to make a show, it can be awkward and require an hour+ of negotiating. We ended up using cabs a few times.The concierge services were useful.It was a clean, fairly up to date place to sleep and stay but nothing special beyond that.
5	I would give this place 500 stars if i could. It's not one of the best hotels i've stayed at, but it did have some of the best staffs I've ever met. Ok, so this review is going to be kinda long so grab some popcorn. A few girlfriends and I decided to plan our very first trip to Vegas and I'm glad this was the hotel we ended up staying at. First off, I would like to send a great big THANK YOU to Tia and Kameron who worked at the front desk. They were two of the nicest people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting! Due to one of the timeshare benefits, we stayed at this hotel for free, so I really couldn't have complained if it turned out badly, however, this hotel was beautiful! Check-in was a breeze, and right after, we were sent over to someone (sorry i forgot your name) who gave us so many free tickets to shows and clubs and gave lots of great suggestions of things to do and places to see. We had a big king size bed and queen size pull out couch which was more than enough for four girls to sleep on. It even had a nice little kitchen area and I immediately felt at home when I was there. We stayed on the ground floor (easier access to the pool) and the pool was amazing!! The 1feet area of the pool had sand on the bottom floor and you could even drag a pool chair into that area to relax and get some sun. The clientele were mostly of the senior citizen age, but they were very friendly. They had 3 pools and a jacuzzi/hot tub (which I utilized at 4am), it was seriously nice!! Complimentary breakfast wasn't all that great (mostly just a bagel, some fruit and coffee), but since we were hardly up during the bfast hours, I didn't really mind. (There's a Denny's right next door if you're desperate). This hotel is off the strip, but they have a free shuttle that goes to The Orleans and New York New York 10 mins after every hour so you can always take it and walk from there. There are also shuttles that go back to the hotel, but we never used it so I can't comment on that. Ok, the real reason for my enthusiasm about this hotel is mainly because of Tia and Kameron and I will tell you why. While waiting for a cab to take us to the airport and then back home, these two (who totally deserve a raise btw if anyone from the company is reading this!!) were one of the funniest, most fun people we met on our whole trip. They kept us entertained as we waited for the cab, but then our day went from great to worse in 5 seconds. Right as soon as the cab pulled up, one of my friends developed a severe allergic reaction to something, hives every where, tongue swollen, so we had to call 911 in case it started to affect her breathing. They did not panic at all, which was much appreciated. Security was called over, the ambulance came and so did the fire dept and our friend was taken to the ED. My other friend and I were left to figure out what to do about our flights. We got the "pleasure" of flying on Spirit airline (who I will happily bitch about on their yelp page and file a complaint with the BBB). Anyway, back to the awesomeness of the front desk staff. I wasn't sure where to even begin, but Kameron offered to help us figure out how to change our flights that we would obviously miss.  Helped pull up our confirmation number and called customer service of the airline. He even talked to them on behalf of us when I was given the runaround. Although unsuccessful, the thought was very much appreciated. Tia started helping my other friend look up later flights that we could possibly take and due to the circumstances, offered to comp our room for the night if we ended up staying an extra night. I was told to go the airport ticket counter to see what they could do in person, and without hesitation, Kameron told us he would drive us there. He was already off the clock while helping us so he did just help us out of the goodness of his heart. He drove us to the airport, waited almost an hour while we sorted out our situation, even offered to drive us to the hospital, but since our friend was doing better, he just drove us back to the hotel again. Seriously who does that?? Nicest person I ever met!!!Tia was also pretty great! Whatever we needed, she was right there to provide or help with. She assisted us right until we left for the airport for the final time. Anyway, that about sums it all up. You know how they say service makes all the difference, well at Tahiti, it really did!!!Not to be confused with Tahiti Village:) Thanks again for making our vacation a memorable one!! Will definitely be back!!!If you got this far, I hope you enjoyed the novel.
4	If you are 40+ the odds are you will love the place. If you want the "party-till-u-drop" type atmosphere, you should stay elsewhere.One star subtracted because you have to stay around the lobby area for free WiFi (ask for login code at the Front Desk) which is very slow to download. I had to cancel my Apps download after trying for 30 minutes. This should have taken 5 minutes max. I am glad the Front Desk person advised us not to connect to the paid room WiFi service company mentioned in their property book because the service is very unreliable. This saved me that frustration + $10, at least.  AT&T phone service sucks here. Unable to send emails or IMs via an iPhone 4S or 3G. TV has basic channels only. With no room high speed Internet service my DirectTV HBO TOGO service or any TOGO TV service does not work. Loved the king size beds and the space. If you like protein for breakfast go someplace else. The AC is literally a "blast". In the living room there are 2 large round vents that can not be adjusted. If you sit or sleep on the couch a vent blast the couch, as the AC cycles. B-r-r-r-r! If you adjust the AC to use the couch the bedrooms get hot. If you adjust the AC to get comfy in the bedrooms, the couch area is to cold. We clipped a face towel to the vent using 2 office alligator paperclips to deflect the air stream toward the floor, since the vents do not move. (See my photo). It worked.Breakfast is a carbohydrate laden affair (big bagels, sweet pastries), strong coffee (Starbucks is next door) and watery juice. I did not see the fruit mentioned by some others. Take the room coffee cups over or you have to use the small Styrofoam cups provided. If your stomach is on east-coast time, the 8AM breakfast start time is to late anyway.Very nice pools with sand. BBQ area and tools are a nice touch also. The bus transportation to the "strip" and a few other casinos is very useful.
4	PROs:1. Affordable. Got the spacious studio suite with kitchenette which came useful for storing and warming up leftovers.2. JACUZZI TUB! So spacious and with jets! One of the best bathtubs I've taken a bath in. 3. Large pools and hot tub. 4. Continental breakfast included (bagel, apple slices, danish, coffee, tea). 5. 1 mile from strip. Offers free shuttle rides until 1am(?). 6. Concierge is friendly, funny and honest. Offers suggestions for free and non-free activities. CONS:1. It's mostly a peaceful, quiet property though I had to put my earplugs in as the A/C ventilation in someone else's room kept on going on/off. Though we got a top floor room, my friends who didn't said they had trouble sleeping b/c they could hear their neighbors above them. 2. WiFi is only offered in the lobby area. Otherwise, it's ~$11/night.
3	One of the better "average" time shares we've exchanged into. Very helpful friendly staff. Clean, pleasant -- though definitely "dated"--surroundings. Good shuttle service to the strip. Easy walk to shopping --including a marvelous and cheap international (food) market. And a shuttle to a full grocery store. To make it better (in addition to some modern in-suite decorating) they need wi-fi in the rooms (now only in the lobby) and a shuttle to the airport. I appreciated the free bagels and cream cheese (unusual for a time share in my experience).  (We bought lox and juice @ the nearby grocery and enjoyed a great breakfast for a fraction of the usual cost.)
5	This place a amazing... although it is not on the strip the place and people make up for that. This resort is located 5 min away from the strip. Jesse the gentlemen helping us was amazing.. Very professional and accommodating.... Made us aware of the amenities they had.. Continental breakfast from 8-10am.. which included bagels, danishes and beverages. They also had movie rentals for the kiddos, a mini put put (golf)...  sundae ice cream at noon(Sunday).  The room it self was spacious, a washer and dryer inside, a kitchen with pots and pans to cook as well as plates and cups..  They had a pull out couch which is so much comfier than sleeping on the ground and cots for us to.. Will be back next time I'm in Vegas!
4	Great place close to the strip. Very clean grounds. Very nice staff. The pool area is clean and playful with a fun vibe. I dig the place for what it is. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I have to reserve 5 stars for places like The Cosmopolitan. :-)Stay here. You'll be happy you did.
4	Great stay! Gonna be there for a "Vegas 2" trip and if I have as much fun as '10 then round 2 should be a blast!
5	Stayed in the 2 BR condo. Great experience. Sure its a little older, but very clean. Bathrooms are modern and roomy. Our rate was $218 (again, two king beds, 2 full bath, and a living area with a pullout and full kitchen) so I'm giving this 5 stars. You absolutely cant beat the value. Nice pools, but small. So dont think you can dump the kids there all day. We used it as a homebase away from the strip. 2 couples and 4 kids under 3. Had a blast. Will stay here again. The TV in the living room is not HD... its an old CRT. But hey, you're in vegas so get off your butt!
3	How is this place a resort? Only good thing was the 24 hour pool. We were here for 7 days with NO housekeeping services. Had to dump our own trash.
2	Not great and not worth the money. The appliances were leaky. When we asked for fresh towels for the bathroom, housekeeping knocked on the door and dropped off a bag without even folding them and putting them away. The continental breakfast is a joke, they don't even have real milk for the coffee. The pool is not very big. This place is located in a sketchy part of town. The bed was comfortable. The TVs are old and not even flat screens. They said they were going to give up a room with a view of the pool, all we could see are the trees. Do not mistake this place for the Tahiti Village, which is a bit nicer. I would not stay here again. It is way less than average.
4	We love this place. It is not elegant but it is a very relaxing place to vacation. We have stayed in some of the most beautiful casino suites which are nice but there is something to be said for an off the strip hotel. Our pool was open 24 hours. There were grills, hot tubs, and two pools. We loved sitting on our balcony over the pool each morning. No waiting for valet, centrally located by a grocery store, pharmacy and access to the freeway to get to Casinos within 10 minutes. The staff was excellent. We are staying again in August.
3	** bad network connections **Stayed here as part of a timeshare exchange with Interval, the rooms are nice , there are a few minor issues with the shower and ac but nothing insurmountable. The primary issue I found was the total lack of AT&T coverage, the crappy wireless in the lobby that can't sustain a Skype connection, the in room wireless is overpriced and also horribly  slow. Lovely place to stay but not if you want to keep in touch with anyone in the outside world.
2	Stayed here for 3 nights.  Overall, I found the hotel itself amenable to sleep - but the staff were entirely clueless and unprofessional.When we checked in, our first room had an *overpowering* smell of cleansing material - so much so, we had to move rooms.To make matters worse, my wife cut her foot in our (well, their) room and the staff were virtually apathetic to helping her. They offered us a new room, but we needed to leave the next day - thus, no good.  I felt like I needed to argue to get some kind of financial comp for an issue that was not our - this to the hotel  manager, Ashley.I was left disappointed and would not recommend this hotel.
4	We definitely had a great experience and can recommend this for a relaxing trip to Vegas. We traded a time-share and phoned the desk. They were very helpful and allowed us to upgrade our room. When we arrived at noon, they were very gracious and we checked in immediately- 4 hours early. The Concierge (two different ones, actually) were extremely helpful and never once strong-armed us for any time share crap. We were logged in for the free Red Rock Canyon trip and also were able to purchase a great discount dinner.show package without the need to talk about or look at the "property".The room was very clean, overlooked the pool as we requested, and quite comfortable. Ice machine was close by (even though we had the full kitchen) and the complement of dishes, coffee maker, etc. was great. There is even a free continental breakfast (very skimpy but totally unexpected and free!) and the pool and hot tub are open 24 hours. They keep to a Quiet Time which is posted prominently and Security walked right out to tell some kids they were making a little too much noise.It's close to some shopping and some quick food and the free shuttle to the strip was on-time and the drivers were great!Overall, we would go back to here OR their companion property (Tahiti Village, since we had stayed there about 18 months ago) without a second thought!
2	We stayed here for a week for our anniversary. The hotel was nice, a lot better then we were expecting. We are a timeshare owner and were staying here with our bonus time. We thought we had booked at Tahiti village.. and were excited because of the pool. We were bummed when we realized we had booked the wrong hotel but we went with an open mind. The pool was not really that great. It was small and not that fun.We enjoyed the room, there is nothing really bad to say about the hotel besides that it was far from the strip. Taking the shuttle was a pain. You had to plan your day around taking it and making sure it was going to the right end of the strip.One thing that was VERY annoying was we booked a shuttle to Fremont street at the hotel. The lady at the hotel forgot to reserve our seat on the shuttle.We had a show at 6:30 and she said if we took the 6pm shuttle we would be there in plenty of time. At 6:18 we still had not been picked up. The hotel said to pay for a taxi and we would be reimbursed. Well we asked for the manager to call us, I left a VM and still no call back. We are out the $30 for the taxi...But only $250 for a whole week to stay I guess you cant beat that. But I would never stay here again. Too far from the strip. I will stay at the Marriott on the strip next time with my bonus week.
1	We had a great time here and the service was great at the beginning. The room was nice and very clean. Due to problems with them giving us back or deposit the manager Charles was very rude and hung up on my wife. He was so unprofessional how talked to her. For that I will never stay here again. If you can't resolve a matter with respect then you don't need my buisness. So I don't recommend staying here again.
4	We had a great stay here, except for the wifi not working, which really wasn't a big deal for us (there's a Starbucks next door). The room was clean, friendly service except for the front desk girl when we first arrived... she was a little grumpy... but it was nice to stay somewhere where the sounds of slot machines didn't reach our room! Very quiet and peaceful... would stay here again!
4	Great place to stay in Vegas but not feel like your staying in the craziness of Vegas. Very calm and quiet property with great decor. 2 pools and a fitness center open 24 hours. Had a small hotel size room but great little kitchenette and all the supplies you would need to cook up something good on the barbeques by the pool. one thing to note is that there is no restaurant or bar on-site. so don't think that you will order a little drink by the pool. there is an extensive room service menu and plenty of places close by to eat if you are not cooking yourself. also I would recommend they get a second jacuzzi ...the 1 for such a big property is not adequate.
5	Great place to stay in Vegas. You can get a Hotel room anywhere in Vegas, what you are getting with this Resort is SERVICE.   Everyone at the Resort was so helpful.  Any problem or question we had was answered quickly and professionally.   We had an injury and they quickly provided us with a wheel chair and helped us rent a walker within minutes.  We had a lost piece of luggage and the resort staff said go to you rooms and enjoy yourselves, let us deal with this and get your luggage for your.   Wow, so nice!   Their maintenance staff provided excellent service also.  Even when it was our problem and not theirs.  The rooms were perfect, the place was very clean, the location was great.  The Denny's beside the resort provided quick meals.  The park across the street was a nice change from the casino views.
4	I would stay here again, I was really bum that we couldn't stay at Tahiti village this trip and had a sour attitude about staying at the Tahiti but over all it was a nice place. The pool was nice, refreshing and not crowded at all. They had a nice BBQ area with fridges so that made it convent to have a nice get together and BBQ with our friends while we swam.The whole hotel had a very nice and clean smell thru-out. The jacuzzi bath tub was a nice treat. Everything was 24 hours and the staff was extremely friendly.The activity center was updated and clean. They have movies to rent for free which was nice for the kids.They had a continental breakfast 7am-10am that consisted of plain bagels with cream cheese, blueberry waffles, bananas and apples... Coffee, tea and orange juice. I felt that was a nice treat considering other hotels don't offer it.They have a small putting green, NOT  MINIATURE GOLF... This could be why people had a bad review about "the miniature golf course"I'm giving this place 4 out of 5 stars only because I've stayed at other places that are better and have more to offer but this place was enjoyable.
4	I would probably rank this as a 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4.My family and I stayed here for about a week. Tahiti is not on the Strip, so if you want to go and not deal with the madness of driving, you should take their shuttles to and from. The shuttles aren't bad - the drivers are friendly and rather punctual, but you do have to plan your days around the shuttle schedules.The rooms themselves were not bad. We had two rooms connected to each other, so it was indeed very spacious. The one bedroom had a decent kitchen. However, the one bedroom bathroom did not have an air vent, which was weird.The WIFI is sometimes spotty, but at least it was free in the room (AT&T).The lounge area is pretty spacious but you have to pay in order to play foosball or pool, which was a bit of a bummer.The location is okay. It's next to a small plaza, including a Denny's and a Walgreens. However there are panhandlers in the area so be careful.
1	2 words: BED BUGS 2 more words: TERRIBLE STAFFI stayed here for NYE 2015. We were there for 6 nights. On the 5th night I pulled the sofa bed out only to see a bed bug scurrying across the sheet. I immediately trapped it in a glass to show management. How did they deal with this? Put us in a different room and that's it. Security came to our room with keys. Not a hospitality member. They only have one manager per day and he's only there from 6am - 4pm. God forbid you need any assistance after 4pm. They claimed to have checked the room for more bed bugs but didn't find any other than the one I did, which I took a video and picture of. Seems to me like they just don't want to pay someone to remedy the situation.We requested that management dry clean  all of our clothes and luggage, they made no effort to help us. They said take it to a dry cleaner and they would foot the bill. Never heard back from the manager. We ended up using vacation time to wash all of our own clothes so that we wouldn't bring the bugs back. We lost an entire day without compensation because the staff here is so incompetent. It was cold so we didn't get to check out the pool which seems to be the only enjoyable thing at this hotel since they want to charge guests to use any of the activity center games as if they are on the strip (3 miles away). I'm extremely unhappy with my entire experience at this hotel. DON'T STAY HERE.
