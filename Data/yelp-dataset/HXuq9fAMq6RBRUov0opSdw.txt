4	Went here last November and was really suprised at quality of food , service was quick and server was very attentive even though we had kids on tow. Special offers on food at certain times of the day , never seems to be packed but does get busy before and after theatre events next door to Omni centre at the Playhouse. Kids are more than welcome as well which is good as it's a really nice place to take them for a meal.
