1	Rude and obnoxious people work here! I will never go to this store again.  ESP when they are not even familiar with their products and are more interested with chit chatting with one another than helping customers.  I felt unwelcomed entering the store and very uncomfortable. It's a shame because I always enjoyed shopping at the Body Shop in the past & love their products.  Oh well at least I can order online
5	I had the best experience here! I was immediately greeted by an employee. She was very nice and helped me match foundation to my skin type. She was very helpful when I had any questions. She also let me know that I received $10 off any item in your birthday month. My luck! :)
1	I was so disappointed with my visit to this store tonight .  When I walked into the store, there were three employees all standing behind the cash registers talking and talking and talking. Only one other customer was in the store. I was in the store for at least 20 minutes and did not receive a single acknowledgment.  The three employees remained behind the registers. I heard one employee identify herself as Debbie. Terrible customer service, employees obviously need more training. I don't plan on returning. I'd rather go to Origins - I've always received fantastic service and friendly employees in their shop.
