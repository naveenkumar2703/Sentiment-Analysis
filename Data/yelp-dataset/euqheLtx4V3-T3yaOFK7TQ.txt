4	Ah Phat Cat, 2 Gyro's for 6.50! Now that's a deal that can't be beat. The Gyro's aren't half bad either. And the service, well once you get used to it (you'll see what I mean when you get there) it's a unique experience. Overall, I think Phat Cat is my current favorite place to eat in Waterloo.
5	Pretty good place. Its an exact replica of MacDonnell Village since he got his training from that owner, and same suppliers for Gyros and Fallafels. The owner of MacDonnell (Across from Laurier beside Pizza Pizza) thought he couldn't make money beside Waterloo, and boy was he wrong. So the owner of Phat Cat took a chance, and its been really successful. I liked it when I was at school. When I was there it was 2 gyros for $5, and a medium pizza for $5 as well. lol.
3	Just another way to take advantage of us poor Waterloo students. Gyros are frozen (I have seen them being replaced). The pitas are "real greek" from Chicago...according to the owner. The pitas are actually pretty good. When you order the 2 pitas for 6 bucks, you are only allowed about 3-4 toppings because the lady working is consistently on her period and is being slaved by her abusive husband/owner. So I can't really blame her.
2	First had this when I first came to the university. The gyro is too salty for my tastes, although quite affordable. The gyro plates tastes ok, but the gyro themselves are again too salty. It is also quite expensive for a plate. Overall not the best greek restaurant
