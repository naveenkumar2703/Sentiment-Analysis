5	This shop isn't about just selling bikes, it is about the culture around bmx. The owner is a long time rider himself and personally text the time to find out about the customer. Personally, I am a new rider who came to serenity in search of my first bike. Tyler spent the time with me and find tuned the bike to my riding style. I felt comfortable to have someone who was so passionate about this sport take the time to show me what I wanted to learn. Even if your not in to bmx you should def check out the shop. The clothing selection is amazing so many different styles and choices. Everything from art to fashion to riding this is a one stop shop. the sign on the door says culture boutique and that is exactly what it is!
5	Best BMX shop in AZ!  Check it out!
5	Why would you go anywhere else!! This place is the BEST! Tyler knows everything there is to know about BMX and can hook you up with the best parts. I have been going here since they opened and couldn't be more pleased. Keep up the good work!
