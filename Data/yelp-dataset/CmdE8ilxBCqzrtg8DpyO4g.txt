1	Young lady on the line was very disrespectful. Food took 2 hours to deliver. Ordered the Brown stew chicken. There is chicken, but where the stew? More light brown that brown stew like my moms used to make. Oxtail is OK, again colors off, taste is ok. Real Jamaicans cooking, just not very well. With the 2hour wait for food it ain't worth the bad customer service.
1	This place sucks...point blank period!!! Growing up on the East Coast; living amongst Jamaicans...I have had the opportunity to eat real Jamaican cuisine...and this is not it. The rice and peas tasted like crap.The texture was overcooked and flavorless. You cant tell me they did'nt use 10 Minute Boil a Bag rice!! The curry chicken was made with chicken breasts, not a whole chicken that gives it flavor when its cut down to the bone marrow.  The curry was bland! My curry chicken tastes wayyyyy better. The cabbage was soggy and again the common blandness. I had high hopes for this place. I feel sorry for these poor Phoenicians who think this is authentic island Yard flavor. Will never go here again.
1	been there a few times,  was not bad the first time I went.  only complaint I had was  their was more side dish than main course.  So I felt like I was getting a sample of the main dish (curry chicken, goat, etc) while paying full price.  went again and didn't even finish my meal.  I guess they were having an off day with the flavor. So I'll be looking for another restaurant soon.
