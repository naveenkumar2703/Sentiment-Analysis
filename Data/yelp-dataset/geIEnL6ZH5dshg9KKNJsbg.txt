4	Whoever is in charge of ordering for this shop should get a medal!  Devine Memories is a small shop with big heart!  While this scrapbooking store is tiny in comparison to others located in Mesa  every inch of the store is filled with quality products many of which I have not see anywhere else!  Devine Memories also has a very large selections of metal embellishments that you can buy one at a time!  Good buy 17 extra purple brads, hello Devine Memories.

Its not huge, but seems to cover all the ground that one would need to get thier scrapbooking groove on.  They even had a lab to work in!  Lovely little store.  Closed on Sundays though.  yuck.
