3	CRISPY ALMOND FRENCH TOAST - delicious - crunchy - buttery - fattening - delicious (but depends on the cook really, I've had it a few times and the last visit was kind of bleh)Service is slow and wait staff isn't the best but the food's decent, the slots pay out and it's in Silverton which is fast becoming a great hotel to stay at when you're in Vegas.
3	This is a great place for a cheap breakfast.  The portions are great and the waffles are even better.  I also like the huge ham steak and eggs breakfast.  The service is hit or miss.  The keno runners are super nice.  If you are staying at the hotel I recommend this dinner type place..
3	During my hotel stay at Silverton, I ate here 3 times. I could not pass up the deal at the time. It was buy one entree, get one free. How could anyone resist? The food and service were average. The first meal I had was a pepperoni pizza. It was nothing special. One cool thing was it was a huge serving. The second meal I had was this weird  burger wrap. The thing that sold me on it was it came with a chipotle sauce, but when I tasted the wrap, you could barely taste it. All you could taste is the bland ground beef. The third meal I had was a Caesar Salad Wrap and that was surprisingly good. The dressing was perfect.I would only recommend this place if there is a deal going on or if you are staying at this hotel. It is super convenient and is opened 24-7.
3	A-OK coffee shop. Since we wanted to take advantage of the BOGO deal going on we went here for breakfast. We got the basics bacon and eggs with coffee. Everything was good except the house potatoes or whatever they were called, more like dry, hard, cold chips. The sour dough was great and our food was served quickly. The service can be hit or miss here. We've come on other occasions and enjoyed other meals too. The ham steak and eggs is ginormous. Prices are also reasonable and with the free offer we paid $10.70 for breakfast!
3	I love the decor in the Silverton, and the same holds true with the Sundance Grill which is located inside. I have only had breakfast here, and it is pretty good. I don't know if I was lucky, or if Dita was unlucky, but I ordered the house potatoes with my breakfast, and they were hot and not overly hard. Not bad with a little ketchup & tabasco added. The service is so-so, which is pretty standard with 24-7 places. Overall, this place is A-OK.
5	I'm giving this place five stars because the decor is cool, the ambiance is great, the service is fast, and the PRICES are CHEAP!!! I stumbled into this little gem of a coffee shop after learning that the Silverton buffet is not open for breakfast. That's O.K. because they have this great coffee shop instead. My boyfriend and I ordered up some tasty omelettes that came with toast and hash browns. We also got orange juice and coffee and the bill came to only $20.00. That's cheaper than a Denny's but with much better tasting food!!! I was actually so impressed with the Silverton that I'm planning on staying here for my next Vegas trip...and their affordable but good quality restaurants are a big reason why. Give this place a try you won't be disappointed and you'll have some extra money to spend on gambling!!!
2	Above average ambiance.  Maybe slightly better than average food. I didn't feel the prices were in line for an off strip joint.  Service we got there was slow.  Took about 2 hours to get in and out from putting our names down to getting sandwiches and omelets during a weekday. It was pretty much the only full restaurant open in the place for lunch when they have like 5 of them.  Cutting service so much won't get more people into your casino.
2	Dry tasteless salmon.  And...we waited 20 minutes for this  fish, without any drinks...because the waitress forgot what we ordered.     Gosh and I  was so starved after the long drive, and this place appeared to look good.   Nice waitress...but she forgot everything everyone ordered several times.  She forgot the drinks and silverwear.  I used the silverware from another table.
1	I used to like Sundance when it just opened, but it has really gone downhill. The service is awful and the food is just as bad..
3	Had a few different experiences at this restaurant, but overall the food was good...pretty much what lacks here is the service. The last time I was here the cook had to double check the order to make sure it was made correctly (thank goodness) and the manager brought out the food... can I tip them instead? The first time I came here I had their surf/turf 3 meal special and they forgot to bring out the wine. the wine! gotta have that! but it's open 24/7, food is good and decent price... so.... I'll return :)
2	Horrible Service. Extremely slow to seat us... and feed us... and water us... and bill us... slooooow.We won't be going back.
3	I have been here several times.  Once, I had great service, another time service was just ok.  The last few times, service was horrible!!  The server forgot the fries with my burger and tried to say that I told him I didn't want any!  I think the food is decent and I usually take my kids here and we head over to the aquarium and Bass Pro Shops after we eat.
4	Most of you know I'm a chicken fried steak junkie.  My friend told me this one was good, so I visited to see for myself.  I asked the waiter if it's freshly battered and he said it's not.  I got scared it was going to be like spam meat like Mimi's Cafe.  When the steak arrived, I looked good and it didn't look like it was a frozen steak and it wasn't like spam.  It was a large flank steak tenderized, breaded and deep fried crispy.  I think the waiter meant it wasn't battered right before it goes into the fryer.  I think this steak is prepared in advance on the premise and put into a container for quick cooking later in the day.  I don't think it's a frozen steak pre-battered shipped in a cardboard box.  The steak was so big, they have to cut it in half to put it on the plate.
2	The Positive: Open 24 hours and served breakfast all day. Also had Keno to play while you ate. The Negative: The service was just ok. Waited 25 min for a table in a half empty restaurant.  Food took a long time and the ruben sandwich was dry and tasteless. Homemade chips where fresh, not greasy but had no flavor like everything else. I had to pour the salt on. I was also a little annoyed that the server made us pass out our own food instead of placing it in front of us.
3	We had no problem with service and more than adequate breakfast food.On my last day I had to try the chicken fried steak smothered in gravy served with 2 eggs  home fries toast coffee wow it was great.We only had breakfast food there all was good.
1	My wife ordered a steak salad and I had the sirloin, both ordered medium rare.  And of course, both were medium well.  We don't usually send food back, but we're going to do so from now on, and we did.  Our new meals were similar to the first ones, but the wife ate hers anyway.  Mine was cooked MORE than the first one, so I just ate the potatoes and veggies.  When the waitress came to take our plates, I said "the cook REALLY doesn't know how to cook a steak, does he?"  She didn't apologize, didn't take the charge off our bill, or anything.  All she did was shake her head and hand me the check.Never again...
4	Loved this place for breakfast.  Nice menu. Cool atmosphere and even great lighting for a coffeeshop-type place. We shared two items, including a veggie egg scramble with spinach and chicken sausage that was excellent. Next time I'd go before 11 a.m. to score some deals. Not only that - but they serve very good coffee!
3	**Summary**       - Meat - I've tried 3 of their meats and the rib eye was the only thing that I'd order again. It's also a really great value for what you're getting.       - Meal vs. Entree - With the exception of the Surf n' Turf, the other entrees let you get a drink, dessert, and soup or salad for $5 bucks more.**Ordered**       - $14.99 Surf n' Turf - Ordered medium rare. Steak was soft but super dry. The deal does come with a drink, dessert (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8umkLwMkM0vP5B8oPiozQ?select=EcrK2N5SP4f_EQkRh2I-Pg), and a soup or salad, so it wasn't a bad deal (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8umkLwMkM0vP5B8oPiozQ?select=ZTtJfOIzkl3Yx2lgYxGCOw).       - $15.95 Rancher's 16oz. Rib Eye - This has been the only meat I've ordered from this place that hasn't been dry. The seasoning is really good and the meat is tender. A great value for $16 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8umkLwMkM0vP5B8oPiozQ?select=XVnwdtHVFBux7aWlTbgesw).       - $15.95 15oz. King Cut Roast Prime Rib of Beef - Ordered medium rare. The prime rib was nice and thick but super dry and a huge let down.**Recommendations**       - I'd recommend this place for their rib eye. It's delicious, big, and juicy. The other steaks/prime ribs I've tried have been trash.
1	Horrible dinning experience from beginning to end. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE if that what you call it. really needs a ZERO STAR RATING MAYBE NEGATIVE. They have a wait to be seated sign at the entrance. stood there waiting for around 10 mins, no one there. walked around but kept watching at a distance to see if anyone was going to return to the counter. NOPE. when the rest of my group arrived, we all store around again waiting. a guy in a suit finally came by, probably a manager with no explanations or apologies, and gave us one of those pagers and said we had to wait another 15-20 mins, NO VIP treatment for elderly and handicap here, walking canes wont even save you 10 mins of waiting. A man with a motorized cart, arrived after us the "manager" even gave him a hard time, but eventually he got in before us. this manager sucks a. i could be a suit too. when we finally got in total 1 hr wait, I was very pissed off to see that there was a lot of empty seating even a bar dining area that we could have ate at. they had coverage lots of it. as we ate dinner more seats started to fill . WTH so why the long wait!? the girl taking our orders had little knowledge about the menu, specials or any recommendation, clueless. we all ordered food that came with salads, the meal, and desserts. The Surf and Turf around $15 and pasta meals around $13. the rolls were cold and bowl of salad was good portion but regular. maybe a min later into our salads they brought out the food, good if we didn't have any salad, but really felt like they were rushing it, the concept of enjoying your dinning expedience is ENJOYING it. I wanted out now. Most of our steaks were burnt and tasted microwaved. The fried shrimp was the only good part about it. The pasta looked and tasted like it was left out for a while, one that you'd microwave from 99cent store. When it was time for dessert we waited and waited, Slice store bought apple pie and white sauce which I'm pretty sure was suppose to be ice cream. Refills on drinks slow, asked for steak sauce never got it, empty bowls and glasses still on the table piled up. the receipt came out fast, i guess they wanted me to pay for this. I AM NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN. Silverton has other places to eat.
2	We've been here numerous times and the food and service  have been pretty good (with food better than service).  But this time, oh my God!  After we sat at the table for a few minutes, the waitress arrived and said:  "Whaddaya Want?"  AND she said it with all the charm and personality of a prison matron.  And it went downhill from there.  Of all the waitresses we ever experienced, she's in the Top Three of the worst of all time.
3	So me and my family came here for a Christmas dinner. The place wasn't packed and it was around dinner time. Everyone seemed to want to hit up the buffet which is expected in Vegas.  There was a prefixed Christmas dinner which wasn't bad. It came with a choice of salad/soup, prime rib n shrimp, and choice of strawberry shortcake/pecan pie.   Our server took awhile to get to us but we didn't mind it since their menu was huge.  I had their prefixed menu and the prime rib was good and big.  The meat was juicy and shrimp was good but it had this green sauce on it that kind of threw us off but wasn't bad.  The strawberry shortcake was delicious and served with ice cream.  The server who served us was sick and had mentioned it but I found it a little disturbing as he is serving food. Not to mention I am pregnant. We had to wait awhile for our refills which he forgot half of the table.  He was nice though.  I would definitely come back for the shortcake.
3	Surf n Turf for me @ Silverton Hotel & Casino and an Asian Chicken Salad for my companion.  Inexpensive, nice setting, not the greatest, but no bad either.  Good place to grab a bite if you're on your way out of Las Vegas and don't want to head to far off the I-15 nor head back to the main strip.Have been there for their breakfast which is pretty good except that their Bellinis aren't quite what I am used to.  But can't beat the price.
3	A very average casino cafe. The service is pretty good, although when we arrived there was a 15 minute wait and the restaurant was practically empty. I assume they understaff this restaurant when they don't expect a large crowd, but other than that, I had no issues. I ordered an omelet and it was very regular. Tasty, but nothing spectacular. Our server was incredibly friendly and our glasses were always refilled. Definitely don't go out of your to come here, but it's a good alternative if you're in the area and don't want to spend too much on a quick bite.
4	I had breakfast here alone after checking out Sunday morning.  There was a long line and there was no hostess.  After several minutes she finally showed up and told everyone that the wait would be around 10-15 minutes even though there were a ton of open tables.  Since I was alone she wanted me to sit at the counter but I HATE eating at counters so I told her I would wait for a table instead.  She seemed disappointed.  Oh well...and the waitress didn't look to happy to serve a table of one either.  I ordered an omelet and a coffee.  The omelet was good but it was served with a small portion of hash browns...not like I remembered from before.I gave the waitress a big tip since I was dining alone and I know that she could have gotten a bigger bill from a party of two or more.  I would come here again though and the prices are decent.
3	My husband and I both got the 16 oz. rib eye steak. My steak was cooked right but his was way under cooked. Service was good but regardless of tonights dinner ill probably come back in the near future.
3	The good thing about this restaurant is that it's open 24 hours. There were lots of seats available during a Friday night around 9 PM. We came in with a group of 7 and had good service. I had the teriyaki bowl/plate. The veggies were fresh, but I should have known NOT to order Asian food at a restaurant named Sundance Grill. Two others in my party had salads that they raved about.If I were at the Silverton Casino during odd hours, I would go here, but it is an average casino cafe. It's not bad, but not that great either. There's gelato near the entrance/exit, but I didn't try it. You purchase that separately, I think.
1	Disaster start to finish. Long wait for a table, really long wait for service, one order was wrong, one had guacamole that was grey/brown. Manager tried to defend it, which was just sad. In the end, to be fair, they comped our food, but if I'd eaten it, no comp could have made up for what would likely have happened. Eat at your peril.
3	Come here only for breakfast and order one thing only. Order the barbecue brisket skillet with hash browns and eggs on top...topped with onion straws.This dish is a game changer and so damn tasty. Go check it our for yourself. So next time you stop at Bass Pro shop mozy on into the casino and check out their casual restaurant and order this!By the way only three stars because everything else is just ok.
4	You get a great deal for the money here, especially if you get one of their dinner combinations. The roast turkey is usually my go-to on this menu. Service is generally good, only had a problem once. Staffing has been improved. One thing I used to find very aggravating was to arrive and be told that there would be a 20-30 minute wait, when I could see vacant tables from where I was standing.
4	Open 24 hours and a real beautiful place. Party of 12 (includes 8 kids) eating @ 10:30 at night after a movie. Real good food for reasonable prices and okay service (our waitress was not on point and not ready for us). Anyhow we enjoyed ourselves especially our food and we will be coming back.
3	typical casino cafe, I really do not have anything bad to say about it. nice decor, friendly staff... I ordered  the omelet with bacon and spinach and It was a pretty good  choice
1	One star is saying alot.  I am a frequent customer here because of comps from my gaming, but quite frankly I cannot bring myself to go back.  A few weeks ago on a Saturday night I was alone and sitting at the counter.  It was 10PM and I ordered the shrimp with linguine.  After waiting 45 minutes I said something to my server.  She said they were busy but my shrimp were on the fire.  15 minutes later I still have no food.  Then some friends came in and I moved to their table, and after they ordered their food my food finally arrived.  There was no linguine only over cooked spaghetti, a few overcooked shrimp and no garlic bread.  Well this past Saturday night were were in there again and I ordered the Jumbo Shrimp cocktail to start.  After ordering our waiter came over to say they were out of shrimp and it would be a few minutes before they cooked more.  Then the waiter comes to our table with a plate of the worst looking shrimp which were below par of their buffet ones and I promptly told him to bring them back, there was no way I would pay $11 for that.  About 10 minutes later waiter comes back to the table with their version of Jumbo Shrimp, warm and not very good.  I was insulted they would even serve that to me, a high level player at that casino.  I had informed the manager when I paid the bill that they never should have served the shrimp and he politely said he knew.  If he knew why was it served to me?  Bottom line here is that a comp isn't even worth it!!!  Service was OK, but the rest of the meal, including my rib eye which was ordered medium and came out barely cooked, was awful.  I did not send the steak back because at that point in our meal I thought I will just take it home and eat it tomorrow.
3	4 Stars for their Food2 Stars for their ServiceI have eaten here about 3 times and every time I have had the worst service. Here's today's experience.  We initially get seated and asked what we want to drink.  Drink arrives fairly quick and I ask the question "What's the Soup of the Day".  Waitress responds that she doesn't know and will ask someone else.  Another waitress arrives and ask us what we wanted to order.  We asked for a minute, which means, come back in about 5 minutes.  This doesn't mean ignore us for the next 15 minutes while you chit chat with another guest.  The waitress must have noticed that we were beginning to wait impatiently.  She arrived at our table and asked us if we were ready.  I responded yes and she immediately said she'd be back. ???????Finally came back and took our order.  I had the Country Fried Steak, Eggs, Hash Browns, and Biscuit/Gravy.  Eggs were a bit runny, but the rest of the food was perfect.  Portions and price are good.  Big portions and fairly cheap.  Besides their eggs, the food is always fresh.  It always seems to take some time for them to take your order here.  Happened to me all three times I've been here.  But the food almost makes up for it.
2	I had the fried chicken, which wasn't impressive.  A little bit of seasoning or something would be nice.  I had the meal, which included dessert.  While I was working through the chicken, the waitress brings my dessert!  Which had ice cream in it!  I was nowhere near finished with my chicken, what in the world would compel you to bring my dessert so that it could melt while I'm eating?!I mean, come on... it's not rocket science!
4	Went to this grill twice last week. After a long day on the gun range my husband was too tired to go out of the casino to find something to eat. We got 4 different dishes in the 2 nights and were pleasantly surprised. I really like bolognese sauce on spaghetti and for a grill, it was excelent. Service was a little slow the second night but that's because it was packed...we choose seniors night to eat there! Would still recommend it to someone who needs a quick good meal.
1	I DO NOT recommend Sundance Grill at Silverton Casino. The service is awful. Me and 3 other friends shared an order of nachos and a special breakfast meal. It took 45 minutes to get our food AND the restaurant wasn't busy at all.
2	I've eaten here two times, and both times just like many Yelpers, I have discovered the service to be an issue.The first time I came I sat at the counter and could SEE with my own eyes how bad things were.  The runners would get the food and come back 30 seconds later asking for fries on the plate, this happened multiple times and the staff just kept getting more and more angry.  At this point you would think someone would tell the cook "Hey these items require fries" but no, so I watched it continue.There always seems to be a line to pay at the register as well and both times there would be a manager asking the cashier "Do you have things under control" instead of rolling up their sleeves and knocking the line out.The food is OK, it's not bad, but I can get it so many other places and in some cases cheaper.  I don't see myself coming back unless I get a killer coupon or comp.
1	Service here is horrible. They didn't page us for a table. I watched our server B.S. with another table while we were ignored for 15 minutes. I can't comment on the food because after a half hour, our sandwiches just arrived.
1	Horrid service and terrible food. Friday night at seven with an empty dining room should have been my first clue.The waitresses and waiters have the personalities of a brick wall. I've had better revive at a gas station. My wife had the New York steak and veggies. Her steak was about a half inch thick but she said it was ok. I ordered fish and chips. Both our meals came with a salad and a role. I love salad dressing or anything that hides the taste of anything that looks like a vegetable but my salad was swimming in dressing. There were floating croutons and a life raft that looked like a cucumber. The roll was good.My fish and chips were among the worst I have ever had. I have had better fish and chips in an elementary school. The fries tasted like they had been sitting around for a few hours and the pieces of fish were dripping with grease. The coleslaw was brown and looked bed. I wasn't even willing to try the coleslaw. The fish was over cooked so the meat was tough and dry and the batter was a dark brown that tasted like the grease was weeks old.When I told the waiter that my meal was so bad, he chewed me out and told me I should have told him sooner. He did offer me something else but I declined. He said he has replaced meals "many times." This should be a problem in his eyes. He did take the meal off our bill but did charge us for the salad. Amazing that they would nickel and dime a patron who had a bad experience. My whole meal should have been removed from the bill. When this restaurant first opened, many years ago, there were long wait times but the food and service was great. THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE.save yourself some time, money, and a stomach ache, avoid the Sundance Grill at the Silverton.
2	The food was ok but the service was bad. The waiter took our order then disappeared. The next time he came back was with the food. He gave us  our food and before we could blink he was gone. He never came back to ask if everything was ok or refill our drinks. He was back briefly to dop our bill on the table then he was gone.
3	Expect not-so-fast service. (On the plus-side, you can have a meaningful conversation with your friends/family)I think its a pretty great deal for the food!  This is one of very FEW places in Vegas that have healthy and FRESH + NON-FATTY food options that is not going to turn me into an obese ball like the rest of Las Vegas!  I especially enjoy their grilled salmon with steamed vegetables and sometimes their salads with gravy on the side.  Their strawberry shortcake with ice cream is pretty good too!I see some people expecting a 5-star service for their steak etc.  Come on.  this place charges over 50% less than a steakhouse!  How can you expect to get $50 service when you are only paying $15?!
2	Ive been to Sundance Grill many times. I've had many many things off there menu- there are some highs- and a decent amount of lows.firstly, there high- there salad is good, not enough options- would be nice if you were able to add chicken,steak, or shrimp to a salad for a fee.there sandwiches are bleck at best breads usually hard, and the french fries are by far the worse ive ever had. i know french fries arent supposed to be amazing but i mean, c'mon.... mcdonalds fries shouldnt be better than yours.....graveyard, the pizzas usually come out raw- and i mean raw.......the upsides..... there strawberry dessert is good (strawberry shortcake) there steak is alright.....there chicken bowl is alright...... sauce is too sweet and the crunchy noodles are nasty. not enough selection of gelato flavorsalso a few times ive had issues such as raw pizzas (4-5x) hard rice (burnt) rotted baked potatoes..... it would really be nice if they improved there sandwiches, changed there fries, and added more salad options (and made an add salad option to the sandwiches)but pleaseeeeee!!!! change the fries (o and the chips as the replacement are gross!!!
4	To me this place is cool. I like the food and the prices are good. Not to say that that u can get food anytime! Half sandwich and soup was a good size to fill up and tasted great. Good deal
5	We've come here for over two years now because we're members for the Player's club. We normally get $15 dining credits in the mailers.We has Charles as our waiter.  He was very attentive, courteous and the up most polite. WHERE DID THEY GET THIS GUY? He went above and beyond our expectations. I can't tell you enough. He was just amazing. He actually changed my whole attitude about the place. If they can get more help like him with all that enthusiasm and costumer service I'd be here all the time.  I really couldn't thank him enough I left him a generous tip because even though we weren't there to get a big meal it was just lunch. He treated us with the most amazing service, always checking on us. He made us feel like VIPs. Which I can't say that for most of the people that we've had in the past here..I hope the food and beverage manager of Silverton reads these reviews.  Charles should train every waiter/waitress in there.  He knows that his job well, SMILES, doesn't slack and was very hospitable!  Fantastic.
2	The only reason I gave it an extra star was because the food was was ok and decent portion sizes. Worst Customer service.  Asked what the soup of the day was...waiter had no idea and needed to go check.  Really? You don't know a basic question about your menu. The waiter had no personality and we could barely hear anything he said.  He never smiled once or checked on us throughout our meal. He took our order and brought our food then check...no "service" with our meal.  No drink refills or silverware for our child.  And the wait time to get our food was a little too long.  A sandwich, burger and quesadilla took 25mins to arrive.  And for the kids meal comes with a side of fruit...it was a slice of watermelon! Needless to say my kid wasn't happy with his fruit.
3	Came here a second time during a weekday around 9 PM. The food came out slow. The waiter was decent.The food was just okay, again. The prime rib was cooked the way we wanted, but flavor was bland. The Reuben was very salty, although they happily piled on a thick chunk of meat. The best thing was the chicken fried steak. I may have to get that the next time around.Overall, this place still gets three stars.
3	A basic Casino coffee shop with a hit and miss menu. You are best off here getting breakfast or for a post midnight snack, when they will be a few specials. My standard order here is two eggs, hash browns, toast and some meat - either the ham steak or bacon depending on what I'm in the mood for. It seems strange to say this, but they have really good toast here and lots of options like sourdough, rye, wheat, etc.. It's sturdy bread and fresh, too. The hash browns have a tendency to come out undercooked, so ask for them to be cooked a little longer to ensure crispness. They have an okay burger here. Nothing to write home about, but good. Their fries are also good.Service is friendly and thanks to a person who is charged with getting your drink order ASAP, it feels quick. If I'm in a hurry I'll sit at the very spacious counter, which has four or five TVs and enough elbow room to read a newspaper. I've not encountered a long line, but I am sure there are times when one exists. Aside from average food, my only other criticism would be the prices which do seem steep. The aforementioned breakfast with coffee will run you $8 unless you are eating in the wee hours of the morning and taking advantage of a special. My advice - don't go out of your way to come here, but if you are at the Silverton and need some food, it's a perfectly adequate option.
4	Been here over 10 times, we stay at silverton a lot and this is a great little cafe. They have gotten quite pricey over the years. They have also changed their menu a lot as well. I personally prefer the Older one that offered the Alfredo pasta etc but what can you do. However the food and service never disappoints,
1	I have been to this Grill several occasions over the years. Service is usually slow, but the food has always been decent, such as the Fish and Chips.We are back in Las Vegas for the winter, thought we get some fish and chips and do some gambling.Well that didn't happen. Showed up today around 1:30 p.m. Had three couples in front of us, the hostess seated the first couple. Then we stood their waiting, and waiting. Meanwhile the cashier is having a heated discussion with another employee, manager walks up, frowning the whole time, and asks the cashier a question, looks up at the line of people waiting and walked off. The hostess returns and takes the second couple. Then we wait and wait, then the manager walks up to the cashier and the other employee who are still in a deep discussion, asks her something again and still frowning, looks at the line again and walks away.Meanwhile the cashier gets some customers to ring up, the employee keeps griping to the cashier the whole time she is helping the guests. Meanwhile we are still waiting for the missing hostess to return. Then the manager walks up, asks the people in front of us how many, he says 2 and he hands them a beeper and says it will be 15 minutes. Then looks at us and we say 2, he then says 15 minutes. My husband said to him we have already been waiting 15 minutes, the reply from the manager, looks like you will be waiting another 15 minutes.What, no apology, no nothing, just a sour look on his face like he just ate a lemon. I told him we really enjoyed the show with the two employee's and we walked off.We left the casino without playing any machines, and went to In and Out Burger across the street. Then went to South Point to play.
2	Tired of the buffet and hungry, we gave the 24/7 restaurant a try.  On the plus side they offer a wide selection of choices as well as breakfast all day.  The restaurant was busy on a Friday night and the wait was about 30 minutes.  I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs which was not bad, but not WOW either.  The sourdough toast however was burned on one side and really ruined the taste of the meal.  Now for the really bad.  My wife ordered a chicken Caesar.  The chicken was so tough and overlooked you might think they walked over to the buffet and grabbed the nearest chicken that had been sitting under the heat lamps since morning.  The dressing was bland and whoever prepared the salad added tons of tomatoes.  The salad went back and my wife had to scrounge a few bites of my chicken fried.  The servers were nice...but they could dramatically improve their income from tips if they could find work at a better food establishment.  The salad came off the bill...and the dinner was a vast disappointment.
3	We have discovered that going off peak to the Sundance Grill... and ordering the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs is a great alternative to the Buffet.  The service has been great and the meal consistently good!  Go on Mondays and Seniors get 50% off your meal!
4	The food here is okay, the flavor always varies depending on the day and time I come here (and I come here quite often because silverton gives me some free dining credits)
3	If you order the cornbeef hash and eggs, you wont get Hashbrowns, servers will tell you the hashbrowns are in the cornbeef hash. True story!  The food servers are weak and they are very slow.  The food is good, it taste fresh and the orders come out rather quickly, just the servers are slow.   I am really not sure if management cares that the servers are slow and at time they take forever to get water or drinks and that coffee cups are always empty.    We like Silverton, just hate the sevice in the Sundance Grill.  I will tell you the breakfast servers are faster then the dinner servers, that not say much, because the Dinner staff is really weak.
4	Very reasonable food that is also reasonably priced,  good service,  good atmosphere and located right inside the Silverton casino. this place is open24h and is kid friendly. i thought the gelati ice cream was way too sweet but the kids loved it.
1	Avoid at all costs.Worst food I have eaten in years. Ordered corn beef hash. Was greasy, flavorless and undercooked.  They served it with a sauce that I can only describe and something like licking a grease trap. I nearly threw up.I was with two other people who ordered the "Big stack" and a salad..similar experiences.On top of all that, the wait staff was rude and lazy and refused to take the meals off our bill.I will never eat here again.
4	Thee best deal here is their late night breakfast menu.  For most of us late workers at least.  I haven't been for anything else yet but the breakfast is great!  From midnight-5am they have breakfast plates up to $5.  You can also get $1 sliders!  We go as often as we can.  If I lived closer I know I'd be there more often.  Beats Denny's, etc.
4	Having the Chicken Parmesan tonight. Very good as far as coffee shops go. Service was pretty good. Very busy tonight.
1	Seems like every time we come here the service gets worse and worse. When they first opened the food was great, service was awesome and prices were lower. Now I simply cannot give one star in any category. The service was so terrible! Lisa was her name. She cared more about clearing 3 tables before taking our order. I felt that was her being greedy! She wanted more customers than to help the ones she already had. After 20 minutes she finally came to take our order. After 15 more minutes the food came out. Mine was cold, in fact the plate was warmer than my food. The butter wouldn't melt over my French Toast. My husbands toast was barely toasted, his hash browns were cold, my daughters bagel was half toasted, my sons French Toast wasn't cooked. When Lisa came back for my cold food she ripped the plate from the table, she was rude, showed zero care, didn't apologize, a manager never came to the table and I still payed for a half cooked meal. But I can tell you that the bus boy, aka the soda man, was AMAZING!! He was quick with service, polite, sincere and apologetic regarding the server... Lisa! Our family and I have agreed that we will NOT be visiting the cafe anymore. A few bad experiences was enough! In fact same on us for giving you guys another chance. Bye-Bye Sundance Cafe!
2	Blah food. Dated bland decor and poor service on numerous occasions. We only tend to come on Senior Mondays as the 50% discounts bring the price in line with the food value. My husband is the reason it gets two instead of one star. He is easy to please as long as there is eventually table service.
3	Hmmmmm    Where to start? We walked in and waited to be seated, we didn't wait very long. We were seated, this is where things got a littler irritating for us.  We sat and waited, waited and waited some more for about 10 mins. I remember seeing at least 4 different servers helping tables.  They weren't incredibly busy. However not one person acknowledged us or asked for drink orders.  Not even a polite smile.   We finally had enough,  got up and walked out.  Stopped and asked for a comment card and abruptly told the lady at the ice cream counter about our experience and she went to get the manager. The manager came over we told her....  She asked us if we wanted an order to go, we Sao not really we were hungry and really just wanted to sit down she offered us to take out booth back and said someone would be with us immediately.   They were and probably te ONLY smiling face we saw in there.   We got out drinks and ordered our food all at once (remember we already had 10 minutes to figure out what we wanted)   Food comes and it was hot, and good.  Thanks goodness.   We finished out meal and and asked for the check.   I don't expect a full comp or 1/2 off but a small discount would have been acceptable.   Oh well we weren't staying at this casino, we were shopping at the bass pro shop.
1	Worse service ever. Left us standing in line. No one acknowledged us again. I have tried to eat in this restaurant before and left because of poor service. My girlfriend walked up to get an ice cream cone because we had waited so long and the girl at the counter turned and walked away four big thumbs down. No wonder the restaurant is half empty.
1	I've been a loyal costumer for 3 years this upcoming August. The wait staff here is not that pleasant. They deal with people all day long that under tip or don't tip AT ALL!  They just assume if you have a dining comp with you you're not a fair tipper.  WELL!  I've always been fair with 18% OR BETTER and the people that have waited on our table know this.  I've seen so many faces in this cafe it's not even funny.  I like a place that has decent food and at one point I thought this place was OKAY!  I've checked in here numerous times. Met some unreal, prude like managers that swear there's nothing wrong with the food. But yet you tell me would you eat that undercooked? They'll just be upset & scowl at you.   Other times I've had pleasant experiences with staff & managers. Sadly the bad out weigh the good for us.  To the point where my boyfriend refuses to go here because he can't stand the wait or a particularly rude manager that used to work during the week (his days off).I've complained about that particular manager in the past & sure enough she remembered us the next time. You'd think she would be pleasant and force a smile or get a different attitude than the apathetic look on her face.  If you hate where you work get a better education or don't get in the food industry.My main reason for giving this poor rating is for the food quality which has plummeted over the past 2 years.  Somebody came up with a great allergen free dish called the Sweet & spicy Chicken wrap. It came with rice noodles on top, some wiz bang Sauce (guessing Asian fusion), chicken and it was probably something I would see off of Master Chef. You understand it looked beautiful on a plate.  OF COURSE it was not popular enough to stay on the menu because being America if it's healthy it's not for US! I was big contributor to this closed mindset UNTIL I found I can't enjoy certain foods anymore. Has they kept this dish on the menu I would probably still come around & put up with the miserable staff.  I miss coming in and being recognized by certain staff but I don't see them when I do have the nerve to stop in. It's a shame. I like being a regular and getting treated like a friend, you serve up the food I leave a nice tip we exchange "have a nice day/weekend". Call it a win. But I haven't had that experience here in a long time here. I wish Jon Taffer would fix this place so it's reasonably priced, with a hospitable & friendly staff that stick around.  I hate seeing a place with different staff every time I visit. It tells me a lot how the staff get treated.  But I don't blame them for leaving when some of the managers aren't the pleasant of people to talk with.If they decide to send me a mailer saying they've revamped the place than sure I'd go back a few times to see how it is. I'm going to miss this casino because it's more my speed, I grew up in the sticks & loved the lodge theme but eh.  I won't stick around just for that.  Bring back the Sweet & spicy Chicken wraps if you DO revamp the place.  That was a winner in my book, simplicity is key when keeping low ticket times.
5	I love this place!They recently updated their menu format and changed a few things. We had: the grilled salmon and spinach salad, a quesadilla (no chicken), garlic shrimp pasta, chicken penne pasta, and a tomato and basil pizza. Everything was DELICIOUS! Salmon salad is soo good! Fresh, flavorful and somewhat healthy. The salmon fillet was large. Quesadilla is a great starter, came with pico de gallo, salsa and sour cream. Everything was fresh. Garlic shrimp pasta was tasty (but oily). Shrimp could've been fresher but was still good. My boyfriend liked his chicken penne pasta, but he thought my garlic shrimp pasta was better.Pizza was AMAZING as always. They have a fire brick pizza oven thing which they cook their pizzas in. Our server was very sweet and friendly. Overall I'm very impressed with their food and quality, as it is a casino coffee shop. I will be coming back!The ice cream from the gelato stand out front is great as well. 2 scoops for $3!
3	Okay so.. I get here @ 6:00 am and the hostess is standing at the ash register talking to a waitress. I wait the waitress walks off with out telling the hostess.... So i give her a few minutes... I get fed up and ask her do i just sit my self down. Her answer "oh i am sorry honey i didn't see you". She immediately sits me down. So my waitress is really nice and awesome. So i ordered steak and eggs which was awesome the corned beef and hash not so much., food service was fast . But my waitress disappeared. Had to get a different server whose name was angel. Who served us with a smile but then couldn't find him again had yo get the hostess who was seating a party to get the bill. The food and the waiters an waitress are the only redeeming qualities here.
4	This is our go-to place while at the Silverton.  They serve a wide variety of food and the service is excellent.  Lots of healthy items on the menu as well as all the comfort food favorites.  Top it off with a gelato and you have a perfect experience.  Don't overlook this gem.
1	We stopped in here because the Mexican restaurant we wanted to go to was closed. First off, we waited about 10 minutes to even be seated. Then our waitress seemed as if she really didn't want to be there. Great. We ordered our food (I got a burger) and it seemed to take a while to show up and additions I had requested were missing. I asked for a side of ranch for the fries, no ranch when the food came, asked again, still 5 minutes later no ranch. By time I got the ranch the fries were cold. Great. I was absolutely appalled by the taste of the food, the service and the entire experience. Never again.
