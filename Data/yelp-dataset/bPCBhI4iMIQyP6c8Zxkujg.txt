4	Dustin is the man. The Smog Man. I had to renew my registration and of course waited until the day before I leave the country to take care of it. (I'm the Queen of Procrastination) Here's how the story goes. First to do is get vehicle smogged. IT DIDN'T PASS. Zippity-fuckin-doo-dah. Whelp, there goes all my vacation money on car repairs. Looks like I will be eating ketchup packets for ten days in Europe. Is it even called ketchup there? Awesome. NOPE. Dustin "suggested" I do this and that and then drive 65 miles and come back to re-smog. I was skeptical, but decided I know jack about cars so I would take his advice. I did this and that and drove 65 miles to Searchlight and back just like Smog Man said. Then I pull back into Jiffy where Dustin is waiting for me. PASSED. The rest of the renewal process was a cake walk. Mission complete.The moral of this boring ass story that contains no sex, drugs or violence is this: Jiffy Smog wants you to pass so screw the vampires and werewolves. I'm Team Dustin. I think his name was Dustin....The End.
4	Need a smog, go see DUSTIN!!!! He is the man.
4	Went in to get my smog during lunch a last week and it was quick and painless.  No one in line, so drove right up, dropped the car off and 10-15 minutes later I am paying.  The service tech was very nice, not the cold I hate my job kind of guy.  Smog only happens once a year but I would come back next year!
5	The smog attendant was very helpful and prompt about the service.
5	Quick and simple. Dustin's a friendly guy and will have you on your way in no time.
5	I'm new to Henderson (finally escaped CA), and was looking for a diesel smog station. Dustin took the time to look up an address that was close to me, even though I could hear he had customers lined up for his business. NICE GUY!!!
4	Fast service, polite employee, was in and out within five minutes. Cost was $28, which is on the higher end of smog places.
