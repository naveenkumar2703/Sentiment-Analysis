4	Located near 215 and Rainbow, Yamaha of Las Vegas is a pretty alright place.  As far as the service department is concerned, I like them; honest, reasonable rates, and straight forward.
5	I've boughten two dirt bikes from Matt and he gave us a smoking deal on both. If you have, or want, a Yamaha this is the best place in town!
5	Matt is Great!  I drive from California to see Matt for all of my purchases, and return for all services.  I have purchased two street bikes and two dirt bikes from Matt.  He always gives me great deals and always honest about everything.  I won't shop at any other places.Jay
