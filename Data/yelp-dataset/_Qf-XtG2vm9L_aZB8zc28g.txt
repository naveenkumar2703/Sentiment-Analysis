5	I realize it's hard to get excited by a Subway, but this location is by far the best Subway I've ever been to. Super fast service- even when the order line snakes out through the front door, it never takes more than a few minutes to get your food and go.The people are friendly, the place is always clean, and as mentioned, it takes less than 2 minutes to place your order, pay for it, and be on your way. I wish all Subways were this good... The few I visited in Austin were terrible. This Subway rocks; or at least the "lunch crew" does.. I've only been here for lunch.
4	I have to give this location a good review too.  I am not a big eater of subs and I hate nothing more than ordering a sub and then being asked 'what do you want on it'.  I ordered an Italian sub, put the Italian stuff on it.  Most subways are staffed with stoners or toothless ex-cons and I don't have the patience to deal with those folks.  The people here never fail to please.  I'd give the place five stars but the quality of the food itself is pretty questionable.
