4	I am reviewing this location for eyebrow waxing only... a pleasant surprise!I am very particular about who touches my eyebrows. And I was thrilled with my end results :) LOCATION :This strip mall salon is hidden from street view (located next to Bashas). Needless to say I was a little worried about getting my eyes waxed at some hole in the wall salon. But in this case I can't judge a book by its cover.  AMBIANCE:  It's just like every other no-name nail salon out there... pedi stations, mirrors, etc. The waxing takes place in the back of the store. Not the most glamorous setting but it was clean and the equipment was well- maintained. I laid on a comfortable padded table with a clean towel under my head. The lady didn't say much (not to stereotype but she didn't speak that much English).THE WAXING: She was very, very thorough while working on my brows. I didn't give her any specific instructions beside my request that my brows aren't too thin when she's done. The wax was the perfect texture and temperature. She was efficient, fast, yet thorough. She cleaned all leftover wax off and applied lotion to keep any redness down. My brows look fabulous and with my coupon it was only $7! Here's the website and they have coupons :) I will definitely go back, especially for the price. http://www.biennails.com/
4	I live around the corner from Bien Nails and I am so glad, because the staff is warm and friendly. The only complaint I have is of the constant attempt to "up-charge" ($5 for this or that). Every service I have had has been done with care, professionalism and quality. I would recommend them to anyone but remember to turn down the extras you don't need or the bill will get up there!
