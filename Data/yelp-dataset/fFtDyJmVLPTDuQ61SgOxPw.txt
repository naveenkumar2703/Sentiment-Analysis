4	I like this 7 Eleven for the following reasons:- It's close my house.- There are plenty of gas pumps.- There is adequate space between pumps.- The Police Substation is a few hundred yards away, this is probably the safest 7 Eleven in Vegas!  Cops are always getting gas here.- The store is clean.Will I return? Absolutely!
1	Don't get a car wash from the pump unless u plan on going inside to get a receipt u can actually read(and its all the pumps not just one).  Also be ready for attitude from Lori when she has to stop talking to "regulars" to do her job.
4	I like this 7-11. The staff is nice, everything is always stocked, and their nachos rock.
4	This 7-11 is very conveniently located for me to get gas and coffee in the mornings. I'm here about once a week. It's also nice when we run out of whole milk for the baby. We can even ride our bikes to it.
3	I come here pretty much everyday but that doesn't mean I like it. I only buy gas from here if I'm completely on empty, otherwise I go to the Chevron up the road. But I am a Slurpee addict and I need ice so I continue to come here.
