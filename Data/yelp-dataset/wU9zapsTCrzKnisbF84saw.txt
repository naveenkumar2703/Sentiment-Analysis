1	WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE   went to this store to send a letter in-state.  three employees, 2 of them sitting on the counter.  told me I couldn't use a UPS envelope for in-state, have to buy an envelope from them.  Employee sitting on back counter says "If you want us to use a UPS envelope we will have to charge you 6 times as much because those are for air overnight".  The fact that there is no air overnight within the state escaped this employee as did the fact that every delivery in state is overnight ground with no upcharge.  REALLY YOU WANT TO CHARGE ME $70 TO SEND A LETTER? Tell your employees to get off their butts and get with customer service.  In the meantime I will be using USPS Priority mail for $5.90 a letter for great service.
5	Would not go anywhere else for my shipping needs. Reasonable prices on packing supplies and services, and fast and friendly service.
5	I had the opposite experience as the other reviewer. Excellent customer service. Helpful, quick,  friendly, and even incredibly tolerant and cheerful about my reckless toddler that proceeded to tear apart the store ad signs.
5	great store, i can take any package any size and the help me quick. good customer service. i saw the other reviews and to be honest, if you know you are going when most people want to take packages, then that is your fault but they are quick even when there is a line awesome store i love ups they cover all of my shipping needs
