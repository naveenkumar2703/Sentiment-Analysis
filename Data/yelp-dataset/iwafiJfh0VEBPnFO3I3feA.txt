5	Doc was funny, staff was professional but also friendly. Vasectomy went quick I was not hassled about my decision or pressured into changing it like I heard from many people from other places. Honestly it was one of those visits that made you glade you came to that doctor.
5	Came here battling my third kidney stone in two years. Have had my PCP and another doc tell me I have high blood calcium as if it is not a big deal. This has likely been a contributing factor to my stone production so I let Dr Shaba know. He quickly pointed out that high blood calcium is not normal and we need to address my parathyroid. I have brought this up to two other doctors now that have acted as if I am trying to do their job and not explored the situation any further. Dr Shaba called it on the first visit, as soon as I mentioned it. This tells me that his knowledge spans far beyond others in his field when it comes to my condition. If you have ever had a kidney stone pass you know how bad the pain is, Dr Shaba and his staff made it quick and easy for me not only in getting me through this stone, but taking strides to stopping them from forming. I highly recommend the staff at Southeast Valley Urology, especially Dr Shaba, for any of your needs in this field of medicine. You guys/gals are awesome!
1	Staff is nice enough but EVERY TIME I come here it over an hour wait and the doc has the bedside manners of a turnip.
