1	Purchased a suit here 3 years ago and was very happy with it. However, I had a far less than stellar experience here just this weekend. Long story short: they didn't have the top I wanted in the right color and size, but offered to have it shipped to me for no additional charge. Great, right? WRONG. What an ordeal. Sounds like a great option in terms of customer service but turned out to be a huge pain in the ass. Not so sure about this place anymore.
5	I had the best customer service ever tonight at The Limited. I went to this location because the one nearest to my home was out of the item I wanted to exchange. Both girls working we're great -- Andee was a complete angel. She was extra attentive, sweet and extremely professional. She helped my mom and I as we enjoyed copious amounts of retail therapy. She was also flexible about performing an exchange on a pair of pants I had a difficult time with. I wish the sales managers everywhere were as courteous, poised and thoughtful as she is -- it was really such an amazing shopping experience and it made me love The Limited even more than I already did, (which I previously did not think was possible!)The Limited should definitely give Andee a raise and ask her to be a Corporate Ambassador helping other stores like the one at Scottsdale Fashion Square in bumping their customer service and satisfaction up to the same standard. She is absolutely wonderful. We had so much fun shopping with her! Don't let this one get away.
