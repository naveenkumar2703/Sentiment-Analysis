5	Fountain Bowl is just what Fountain Hills needs!  I love coming here to play whenever I'm in town, and Sam and Diana are the coolest bowl owners/managers I've ever met.  The decor is nice and I love the remodel work they've done with the bowling alley.  Also a fabulous way to get out of the hot Arizona sun in summer and enjoy some AC while sipping Coke and bowling the afternoon away.
5	What a awesome time you can have here! Fun music and everything is automated.  The flat screen TV' s tell you how to throw your next shot down the lane. It is super clean and great family fun.  I think we are going tonight! Wish me luck on beating my husband, he throws a mean curve ball.
5	Diana (one of the owners) is FANTASTIC.  This is one of those best kept secret places.  Really GREAT place.  Smaller - which is a nice change - clean, modern, inviting but yet with a fun retro feel.  All ages feel welcome and comfortable here.  Arcade games and those great grabber stuffed animal machines too!  Only suggestion would be to offer some grilled chicken tenders or something for those needing to be more health conscious (Snacks are typical deep fried or candy bars/chips type).  Diana cares about the business and customers and it shows... and it makes for a great customer experience that is worthy of repeating again and again!
