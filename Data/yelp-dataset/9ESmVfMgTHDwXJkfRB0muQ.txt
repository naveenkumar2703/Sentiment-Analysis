4	This location is a little over a year old and has the clinic section I have gotten flu shots here last year and also this year both times were simple and quick. They are well stocked and the staff is helpful.

4	After calling NINE different pharmacies to fill a prescription I needed rather promptly, I was really frustrated... on a whim, I pulled through this Walgreens' drive-through expecting them to also be unable to fill my prescription.  Low and behold, they actually had both of my prescriptions in stock!  My lucky day :)  The guy who helped me (Matthew?) was incredibly helpful and filled the prescription quickly.  So happy!
5	Lacey Roach, Pharmacist does an EXPERT level job giving fly shots!  I'm always nervous, but u truly did not feel a thing. Great store, friendly service. Thanks, Lacey!
5	Its hard to write about a drug and cosmetic store because they are all so boring. This Walgreen is conveniently locates at Greenway and Tatum on the north west side. I like the fact that there is a drive up window to make it easier to pick up prescriptions.  The staff is pretty helpful too. They seem to not mind stopping what they are doing to help. There is also a chase atm located here. If you have to wait for a prescription , be sure to stop in at the dunkin donuts for a coffee or modern grove for a bite to eat.
