4	Came here to look for a Visor for a car that I recently purchased. The Yards prices are reasonable a visor only ran me $5.00 where at NV pic a part in Henderson they wanted $15.00. Less cars to choose from its a yard mainly focused on trucks but the stuff still works. Worth taking a look at if you need a part.
5	They have cars also!!I was at the strip and I smashed my 2005 Nissan maxima side view mirror at the Wynn hotel, I didn't want to pay dealer price so I looked for a junk yard, by the name I thought it's just for trucks, but when I called, the told me they have 3 cars like mine in stock and it's available!!10 min later it was there.. It was 4 exit away from the strip! Found my mirror in 3 min (same color also!!) and they were so nice that they installed it for me!!I would recommend them any time to every one who needs a part and don't want to pay dealer price!
5	These guys are completely amazing. They helped me with my car and the prices on all the parts are unbeatable. Very helpful and great decor of all the license plates.
5	Nice
5	So far a 5 star I just purchased a used engine from them and have not installed it yet I hope it's worth every penny
