2	Not a great place for food, but when needs must Samsons serves a purpose. This is normally walking home late at night from punk gigs, pubs etc after skipping dinner thinking we will grab something on the way through the evening. The pakoras and pizzas are very reasonable, but the chips are a bit hit and miss. I am quite taken by their potatoe fritters for some reason, and I dont particularly like chips at the best of times. If you need food it always seems to be open and is proabaly the best option in the area for street food at night.
2	Even though Samsun's always seems relatively busy after about 10 at night the food is never fresh and certainly the chip shop side leaves the nasty clinging feeling of grease in your mouth, not appealing in the least. The only thing I have found that is passible is the pakora, however even these are not the best. Concorde at near by Tollcross isn't open as late but the food is better...Samsun's survives I suspect on (uninformed) passing trade and kicking out time from the many bars in the area and from the Cav (Cavendish/Lava Ignite as was) night club...
