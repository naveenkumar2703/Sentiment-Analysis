4	Nice park tucked away in Southern Highlands. We primarily use the swings and the playground and in the summer the splash pad. I do see people enjoying the large grassy area and tennis courts often. There are only four swings, and when busy expect to have conversations with your little one about waiting turns. Two swings are bucket style and two for the older kids. Play ground equipment states 5-12, but we've been coming since our toddler has been walking. Especially like that it is enclosed and shaded with benches within the gate. Splash pad is fairly small and right next to cement which gets very slippery. Only thing I don't like about park. Water shoes help with the slip, be careful regardless. While I don't play Tennis the courts look to be in good shape, I don't see cracks, lines are bright, and nets are fine.
5	Love this park! It's about a 5 minute walk from us and we love to take our pup here. The park Is taken care of very well and is pretty large for a park in a community
5	This park is by far my favorite in Southern Highlands. It is extremely quiet, secluded, and beautifully maintained. They have a great variety of things to do.
