5	Great donuts especially when they are hot.  Not too sweet.  Cheap.  My new breakfast place.
5	Yummm... These donuts are great... The cinnamon sugar donuts remind me of the churros in Disneyland! Reasonably priced too. What a nice quick breakfast or an afternoon treat!
5	These donuts are the best and at $2.50 for 7, everyone should give them a try.  They are made fresh, fast, and taste so good when they are hot that I almost ate them all before I pulled out of the parking lot.  Owners are super friendly!
4	Tried this truck out at First Friday this month. Enjoyed the yummy donuts but what really Wowed me was the service. They came out with a smile serving the yummy cinnamon donuts and offering coupons for the next time I checked out their truck! definitely worth checking out.
5	These donuts are UNREAL. I mean, lets be real, is there anything better than fresh and hot donuts?Try the "Omar Special" you won't regret. For only 2.50 (or 3.50 with 2 toppings) for a set of 7, you can't go wrong.Seriously though, go here. YUM.
5	So goddamn good.Its the complete opposite of Teen Wolf 2, but in your mouth.
1	Couldn't find the place. Looks like they're closed now. Tried calling the number got a voicemail for a Google voice number. No answer so I'm assuming they are out of business? The pictures of the donuts look very enticing. Sad that they weren't able to stay in business.
