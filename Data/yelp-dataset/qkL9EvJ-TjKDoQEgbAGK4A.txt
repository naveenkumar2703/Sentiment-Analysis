4	This is one of the few Walgreens with liquor... and a large liquor area.  Not the best selection, but definitely good when you're in a bad mood and just want a fricken drink.Yeah... I had a lot of those days a while back and the poor kid behind the register actually waves at me when I walk in. lolI like it though.  Very quick to check out, never had a problem, and the clerks are friendly.
4	Really nice employees. Open until 12:00 so, it's really convenient.
1	I would give no stars if allowed. Betty at checkout was extremely rude and abrasive. However manager working at the rear of store was helpful and gets the star here.
4	Pretty standard Walgreens! Most of the people who work there are nice. Never had any issues.
