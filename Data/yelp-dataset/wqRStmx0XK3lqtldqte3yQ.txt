3	Right in the middle of the busy shopping area of Stockbridge, Goodfellow and Steven is a bakery which has one of the most delicious front window displays of any shop! As you stare through the window a selection of mouth watering cakes is on offer from small to large cakes with a variety of icing patterns! I couldn't help but go in and on top of the large cakes on offer this bakery also provides pies, pastries and also hot foods for lunch takeaways! The cakes do indeed taste as good as they look and it is quite a nice change to go into a local traditional bakery rather than your typical Greggs (Even though Greggs do offer tasty rolls!). However, even though it offers what a normal bakery offers, this shop specialises in cakes and while in the shop you can order cakes for special events such as birthdays! It would be wrong just to watch by this shop without at least trying a cake, a cake made by a bakery which has founded in 1897!
4	Good fellow & Steven hold many childhood memories for me, I used to go into their shop in Dundee with my great gran and get a box of their chocolate violets and enjoy them with a cup of tea. I was having a few folk to my house yesterday for afternoon tea and I knew where I wanted to go to get scones.  Also ended up getting a dozen of their mini glazed rolls ( which are delicious for adding egg mayo too) and a dozen of their red velvet cup cakes. The staff were brilliant and packaged everything up well for transporting and were able to tell me the ingredients of the products and I was so pleased that they use beet root juice to colour the red velvet cupcakes instead of cochineal which isn't veggie. I also bought a box of chocolate violets, I couldn't help myself, they are just wonderful. This is a traditional bakery, they know what they are doing and have been doing it well for many years.
