1	This location sucks!  The guys are rude and very unhelpful!  The line was long on a hot day and so I parked and walked around the motorsports parking lot in the same complex.  They left my vehicle sitting and wouldn't do anything until I came back.  Since there were so many guys standing around, I found it difficult to believe someone couldn't get my info.  I told them I thought they didn't handle the situation very well.  The guy proceeded to tell me "too bad".  And when I asked for his name and the number to corporate, another guy said "why, he was just telling you how it is".  Which only pissed me off more!  They proceeded to talk amongst each other about me so I could hear them.  As soon as I pulled around the corner, my vehicle died.  They wouldn't help.  I called AAA and my battery cable was conveniently lose.  He tightened it with a wrench.  Funny since they had just checked the box on my receipt that indicated it was in good condition.  I called corporate and they insisted the employees would not do this and I had to be making it up.  I've gone to the location 1 mile from this one and had no problems!  Pass this location and go to the one on 67th!  The prices are better, faster service and kinder helpful employees!
4	Very fast service! I went in at 1:50 to get an oil change and was paid and out of there by 2:10. I went in knowing they'd try to upsell me seeing I am a young female. To my surprise they actually didn't try to sell me a million things. Yes of course they told me what they think I should fix but it was no pressure at all! I will always come here for oil changes. Only down fall was it was $50 for a simple oil change.
