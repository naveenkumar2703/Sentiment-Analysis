5	This isn't the right location, as mine up in Cave Creek was not listed. I have nothing but great things to say about this company. I brought my car in with a bad battery. They checked, it was under warranty. They replaced it on the spot, and there was no charge. They pulled it out and put the new one in, right in the parking lot. I strongly recommend this company.
5	Amber has helped me a couple of times in person and she's great - very friendly and knowledgeable.  She performed a complimentary check on my alternator and sold me the replacement part that I was sure I needed.  A week later it turned out that it wasn't the alternator (not her fault all she did was tell me the reading - I was going by a diagnosis from Sears :-( I brought back the part with my receipt and was immediately given credit back to my card - easy-peasy!I like that the store employs a couple of women.  Virtually everyone I've dealt with (male or female ;-) is very nice, professional and happy to help or answer questions.  The amazing part is that the store is open until 10 pm most nights (check for exact hours) -- so convenient for those of us that turn into "vampires" in the scalding Phoenix summer heat!Just now Bobby helped me by confirming that my new parts had come in -- nice guy!I'm paying off my car loan this month and already things are flaking out so i expect to need more help in the future and I'm definitely grateful that this OReilly store is almost right around the corner - I'll be back!
5	Super helpful staff. Glen looked up my part, told me the different pricing, and then switched out the part for me. Awesome!
5	Awesome staff here, brought my wife's Frontier in when her HID lamps went kaput and we were helped by Timothy and Danni, who were very helpful with picking out a new pair of 'civilian' headlights as well as a new engine air filter. Would definitely go back.
