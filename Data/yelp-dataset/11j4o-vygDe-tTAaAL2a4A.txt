5	The prices are AMAZING!!! The clothes are all color coded, seriously you walk in and you see sections of all black fashion,white,red,blue,turqouise,pink,purple...etc!! things you could get at macy's or JCP are wayyyyy cheaper here and better quality as well! The shoes are set up the sameway and are total going out shoes! I believe they do military discount as well! When i head this way to town i usually hit both Fashion Q and Rainbow as well as ROSS!! A total shopping day! :)Oh also they have tons of cocktail dresses!! in tons of colors! just amazing!
2	This place is now called Rhapsodille. Cheap, good style, color coded, but fitting room is more a prison type experience...not that I've been to prison, but I'm sure it would be like this. Just a big room with mirrors and chairs....everyone tries on together...Yay. So make sure you wear your underwear! You're welcome. One of the young sales girls was not customer oriented in the least....too much attitude, but what do you expect when your buying a 15 dollar dress...take the good with the bad.
1	I go to Rhapsodielle all the time, but yesterday was my first time going to the location on Nellis. I walked in & the emplyess just looked at me & continued there convo in Spanish. Another customer had to interupt there convo for help. I was in the store for 45 min & was never acknowledged. When I went to pay they never stopped there personal convo. I will never go here again it they have no customer service skills. They don't even deserve one star
