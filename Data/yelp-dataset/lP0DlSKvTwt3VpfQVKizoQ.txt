5	This place is pretty tough to find, there really aren't any signs at all. What they do have is world class cocktails, an amazing selection of scotch, and a wine list as good as any I've seen. Gets pretty crazy over at Kitchen Bar, but you always leave satisfied!
5	This place is amazing-- so perfect and tucked away! The cuisine is always different, versatile, and delicious. They always have a cocktail menu  paired with the menu for the evening but the guy who works there can make you just about anything you want. I attended the Scotch & S'mores event and nearly lost my mind-- peanut butter, homemade marshmallows, and a healthy pour of Jura Superstition. Kudos to everyone at KITCHENbar: 81st and Elm!
5	Is PBR more your speed? Well they've got that too!
5	Nothing but a bunch of 70pt Scotches here...ice is shoddy as well but it gets the job done.Been here a handful of times, not sure they follow no burn days.  But the bourbon staved smoked marshmallows are to die for.  You can also enjoy a nice selection of Guatemalan beers and Mexican IPAs from the Sonoran region.
5	Sometimes you find a place that redefines what you think is possible in a restaurant!! Amazing food combined with amazing staff. Come on the slightly slower midweek for the best service, but the cocktails are always on point. and the bartenders are amazing!! Never had a bad bite, and the oysters are the best in Phoenix!
1	Does this place really exist? Foursquare doesn't have it.   Google doesn't have it.  I will totally change my review (or delete it) if someone can chime in and confirm this place...
