5	Excellant service by people who care.
5	Staff is professional and knowledgeable, they care about you and why you are there.
5	I've had several occasions over the years to use different physical therapy locations. WOW--this is in a completely different category than all the others.  I met with Nicole Evans (owner) initially for my prescriptive exercises, and each time after I worked with a therapist, Nicole always ended the session with a massage of my knee to check progress and talk with me.  The room is much smaller than I have previously had, with fewer patients scheduled in at one time.  There are always several therapists to guide and help you.  I was not only impressed, but simply amazed!
5	I have been coming to Tru for a few weeks for PT.  Thanks to Pam L. who I met at the Barre3 CMYE, I learned about Tru right when I got prescribed PT by my doctor.  It is very convenient for me (a few minutes' drive from home) and they are open 7 AM to 7 PM  several days a week.  I have made 5 PM appointments every time and have been able to leave work, change at home, and make it here on time.I see Tarah as recommended by Pam L. and she is wonderful.  The whole staff is very nice and it is a collaborative effort during sessions here.  I feel comfortable here, and the background music in here is really good too!  The price is reasonable since I have not met my deductible and pay for all medical expenses out of pocket.  I have learned great exercises to do at work as well to prevent injury and hopefully heal more quickly.  I recommend Tru if PT is an option for you.
5	Nicole and her staff and the very best! I am now on my second rehab in less than 1 year, with great success! The facility has a real family feel. This is much more than just a rehab program!
