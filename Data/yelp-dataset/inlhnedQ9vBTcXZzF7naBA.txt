2	*Update*Oh... my... GAWD... what happened to you, Safeway? The wine selection is about a third of what it used to be. The bakery doesn't carry the yummy desserts that it used to. The staff... WTF? Does Safeway not have a secret shopper program anymore? I had to return an item, which I had purchased yesterday, but then realized it was 11 days expired. There were SIX employees, literally standing around, as a manager rang up customers and handled my return. Does she apologize? No. Does she ask one of the employees to get a replacement? No... she tells me to go get it and come back to the CS desk. So I grab the item and go back... but she's ringing up another customer and I'm staring at 6 people, who just stare back. I was truly apalled, at this display of mismanagement and apathy. This location started off so well, too. I guess that is what happens, as the real estate flopped pretty badly in this area. Time to select the cheese to go with my whine elsewhere.  Down from 4 stars, to 2. Sad. Just sad. ____________________________________________________I don't care that Safeway charges a bit more for normal stuff. I just love this location. Friendly, helpful people, always yummy stuff in the deli, fresh veggies/fruits, pretty big wine selection for a chain store, and the guy in the bakery is an absolute doll to my cookie-grubbing offspring. This place is really convenient (gas station, gift cards, flowers, Starbucks) but it could have all that and I'd pass it up, if the people weren't so darn nice. Yeah, I know they do (or did) secret shopper, but the cashiers are always really fast, talkative (I'm a total stranger talker) and smile when I have to force my kids to put back the umpteen packs of gum they've grabbed. They make me feel welcome, instead of rolling their eyes when I can't find my card or just gossiping with whoever is bagging instead of saying 'Hi'. Plus, I usually don't have to play 'dodge the f'n shopping cart' in their parking lot. A little ambience goes a long way. You live out this way... try it.
2	This Safeway location is the PITTS.  Shop elsewhere and AVOID this Safeway at all costs.  They are incapable of resolving customer service issues and quite frankly, the store doesn't care.  The management does not care, and their corporate management does not care.  (Yes, I had to escalate an issue to them, and they still would not help.)  Anyways, let me just say clearly and in no uncertain terms:  This Safeway is PISS POOR.  Avoid.
1	Called ahead of time to ask if they carried sushi wrappers, seaweed.  The lady on the phone put me on hold, came back, and said yes.  I took the trip there & couldn't find it.  I asked for help there to find it and a person who worked there couldn't find it.Also, don't understand why an organic sign is outside when there is hardly an organic section to start with, and has few items in it that are not so old you wouldn't eat...
3	Very basic, gets the job done!
4	I don't do a lot of grocery shopping,,,,,, don't you judge me! lol I was at the bank next door & was dying of hunger & I remembered that they have a deli that years back had a sandwich I was in love with. The deli is as soon as you walk in, right near the Starbucks. Low & behold, my old flame was still there. The California Dreaming Signature sandwich (insert googly eyes & big sigh here). It's turkey with avocado (fresh, not that weird sour cream blend they try to give in other places) & what gives this sandwich that extra little something is the ranch spread they add. This is NOT a light sandwich, but it fills you up oh-so-good :) The service was not over the top friendly, but they were polite & professional, which works just fine for me.
3	I shop and get gas here sometimes when I can't find what I want elsewhere. Fry's tends to be more crowded so I usually come here instead. Unfortunately, there is not much of a grocery selection so I don't come here often. I also think the prices are a bit high.
3	This Safeway is okay but it seems to be understaffed and there is no self check out! This store is almost a ghost town all the time and if you come here you will see. The only reason I give it a few more stars is because they have a Starbucks.
4	Get your killer gas discounts one, in store says up to $1.00, but now signs outside say up to $2.  I find that I have to ask for a receipt at the pump and I have no issues with the discount. The times I forget to hit yes for a receipt, I get robbed by st least .10 cents, once .40. I've seen other customers with the same issue.  As for the store, for being a newer one, it's lacking a lot. I'd drive up to Cotton and Bell, but I just go to Frys. The pharmacy is good, always have my meds in stock every month like clockwork.  Check expiration dates, but that's Safeway in general, not just this location.
4	I like coming to this Safeway.  Scott, the manager is super nice and he is ALWAYS there!  There is not a lot of people that shop here, which is nice when you're in a hurry.  I do most of my shopping at Frys but have noticed the last couple of times that the produce at Safeway has been cheaper and of better quality than Frys.  They normally have 2 registers open but they quickly call for help when the line gets a bit backed up. So if you are in a hurry and just need to get in and out quickly or want really good produce give this place a try!
3	I shop here all the time.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  But .......the bathroom is always NASTY.  I always question if I should shop there when the bathroom is always disgusting. Yucky
4	Eli gives excellent shots. That is something for me to say as I hate shots. On the way out, passed by the Deli. They are advertising Street Tacos, Taco Tuesday 4 for $5. I'm hungry for tacos so this sounds really good.  We get two each fish tacos & chicken tacos. There is Thousand Island dressing topping the fish taco, that's just So wrong!!  The chicken has a decent spice on it but still falls short. Overall they weren't bad, just not good. If you want a quick taco that tastes like a taco, go to Del Taco, TacoBell or even Jack in the Box.
4	It's a Safeway, so it probably could never earn five stars from me, but I want to call out the Meat and Seafood department employees as being very helpful and super polite. Every time I've been there it has been a pleasure to purchase from these respectful and friendly people!
