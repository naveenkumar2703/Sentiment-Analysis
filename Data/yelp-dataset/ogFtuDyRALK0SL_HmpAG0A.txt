5	Watching the Thunderbirds is always a treat.   They were part of the opening ceremony on Sunday's NASCAR race (11-Mar-07).   It's simply awesome to see these guys fly in formation.   Good job guys and thanks for serving.
5	Great learning experience. The museum is good knowledge of how far the thunderbirds have become over the years. Great for kids to learn and adults can learn alot too.
2	Yup
5	A real cool SSgt, Crew Chief from the Thunderbird Squadron, gave us a guided tour around the squadron and hanger where the Thunderbird F-16s are parked.  We saw a 10 minute video of the history of the Thunderbirds in their ~50 seat theater,  Then the SSgt led us around looking at the Thunderbird collection of artifacts, gifts, and newspaper clippings they have collected since their beginning, while explaining the complete history of the Thunderbirds.  After his briefing he escorted us into the spotlessly, clean hanger where the Thunderbird aircraft are parked.  One of the planes had it's engine removed and we were able to look it over.  There was also a full size F-16 cockpit model for viewing.  (I did not ask, but I believe younger folks and kids can sit in the cockpit.)  This a hidden gem, not too many people know about and it's FREE.  Located next to the flight line on Nellis Air Force Base, I do not know the difficulty for civilian visitors getting there.  I'm retired Air Force and was able to get on base with my military I.D.  My Garmin GPS took me directly to their front door.
5	Excellent place to see what the Thunderbirds are about and check out the planes. I think it's amazing how sharp everyone looks, even the mechanics take great pride in their uniform and represent the Air Force well. I wanted to spend more time here but we had a lot of duty to attend to. Must-see if you visit Nellis.
