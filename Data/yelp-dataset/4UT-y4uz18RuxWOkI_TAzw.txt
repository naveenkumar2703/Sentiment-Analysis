5	Best place in Phoenix for equipment.  Staff is very helpful. Prices are competitive.F.S.
5	I need a gift for my husband's birthday and I stopped in the Hornacek's. They had everything I needed, since my husband is an avid golfer. The staff was friendly and knowledgable and very professional. I will definitely go back for all of our golf necessities..
