5	Great location. Very friendly staff and pharmacy. Small town store feel with big store name.
4	Hard to get excited about a pharmacy, but this local store is always friendly, well stocked and has a great Redbox in it.My kids and I are ALWAYS here for something!
2	The rudeness on behalf of some of the employees at this Walgreens location is profound. One particular visit to this Walgreens I clearly overheard employees laughing at my expense because I couldn't find an allergy medicine. Meanwhile, I was waiting at the counter for service. I now avoid this location on principle. I left fuming, and who wouldn't in my shoes, seeing as all I did is ask a benign question about where a brand of allergy pills is and I don't think that is deserving of a humiliating response.
