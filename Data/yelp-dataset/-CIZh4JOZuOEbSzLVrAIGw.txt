5	Sunrise Casablanca is a nice little bar tucked away on the East Side of Las Vegas (I think it's actually apart of Sunrise Manor, NV but whatevs).  I like to cruise by here to relax, sit at the bar, and watch a game on the TVs hanging above the bar itself.  Not too crowded when I go in and still not crowded by the time I leave.. just how I like it.  They have a full menu of bar food and also have Black Butte Porter, which is one of my favs, on tap.  Nice bar, nice people.. definitely stop in to try it when you're in my neck o' the woods.  Definitely a good time.
4	Great tacos!!
5	I've been going to this place for years It's definitely one of the best kept secrets in Sunrise Manor. Great atmosphere, great food, affordable drinks. It's not overcrowded and the employees and clientele are very cool. I'll continue to head to the "Cas" whenever I get a chance!
5	Greatest place on the mountain! Wonderful barstaff, great view, play pool, gaming, or have a party!
