4	This is a great place! A group of us went there for brunch. Did you know that champagne is complimentary?? That provided for a very memorable and special start to the weekend. The food and service was very good, as was the ambiance and beautiful natural surroundings of the area.It is a bit far from our usual stomping grounds in North Scottsdale, but the drive is relaxing and the place is worth the trip. We will be back!
2	Waitress was miserable to deal with, very curt without any provocation. Not the best service, too bad, that is very important to me! Food was just okay, she didnt bring me what I ordered, but I didnt feel like putting up a fight in front of my elderly family during lunch.  Probably wont go again.
4	Friendly great service on numerous occasions. Patio is eclectic and refreshing, an oasis in the desert. Menu is wide ranging. My favorite - the lobster pasta! Prices very reasonable considering the food quality, presentation and ambiance.
