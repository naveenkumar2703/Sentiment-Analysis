4	Located lower level in Arrowhead Mall, this location has a good assortment of eyewear, clothing, watches, and even shoes/sandals.  Friendly service and a few good deals to be had this time of year.  Will be back again for sure.
2	They're OK. The selection is less than other Oakley stores I've gone to (in California). The service, however, is just as disappointing. Again, NO ONE even spoke to us- maybe its the company policy NOT to talk to the people that potentially could determine whether your store stays open or closed. :/ Anyway, I saw the item I've been spying on for the past month or so....despite the crappy service, decided to just get it anyway- it was calling out to me.Go to ring up: 1) if you don't like your job, goodness- you can't be making that much working PT- go find another damn job. You obviously hate it there.  2) I'm buying apparel- why would you leave my jacket on the counter, give me my receipt then look blankly at me...."oh, did you want a bag?". SERIOUSLY. holy canoli. 3) Don't just throw my stuff in the bag- I was tempted to throw it back in her face and get a refund. My friend with me couldn't hold in the laughter- it was pretty ridiculous. Thanks, I'll order online next time. At least that way, i won't have to ASK to have my stuff packaged- god forbid.
5	The guys here are very nice. They seem to genuinely enjoy their job!
