3	Oooh, this is a difficult one to call. I've looked at some of the stuff in here and thought, yup, absolutely, that I would definitely wear, then in the same heartbeat have seen another garment that is just a bit too mature for me, or not really my style, so it really is a mixed bag. Regardless of what my personal style thoughts are, this is a cool little boutique in an area with quite a few little similar independent shops. It definitely differs from say, the independent shops on Broughton Street, as I think it's trying to appeal to a wider age range and a few different styles, rather than focusing on being young and edgy, but a lot of the clothing in here is very different and certainly unique, so it's well worth having a look as there are some great individual pieces. More often than not there are some really cool jewellery pieces and accessories on display, although sadly out of my price range a lot of the time.

Its vibrant pink colour scheme was striking, so I wandered in for a quick browse.The boutique is clean, fresh and uncluttered, with a handpicked selection of pretty cardigans and dresses. The designs would appeal to a slightly older, refined audience but are in no way frumpy - all the dresses and jumpers were modern, quirky and bright. Prices are steep but they had a very reasonable summer sale on when I had a look in yesterday, with some tags being slashed to almost half price!The lady working was very friendly and attentive, instantly checking if I needed help with anything. Sadly I couldn't afford anything so I only stopped by for a look, but I'm sure if I was stuck she would've been very helpful.If I was in my 30s and had the cash to burn, I would be more than happy to model one of their gorgeous dresses. They are elegant, well made and eyecatching - a treat if you're looking for something unique for a special occasion!
