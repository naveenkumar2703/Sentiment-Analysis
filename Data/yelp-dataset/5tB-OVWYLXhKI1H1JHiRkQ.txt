5	If anyone is looking for a place for their parent or friend, you need go no further.  We were struggling with my father going through the stages of dementia, and general failings of age, medication, etc. and we were referred to this fabulous care home, Sunrise Home Facility, managed and owned by Lida Cubillos.  He is now there and doing so well, we are able to breathe a sigh of relief and all the anxiety about him is now gone for us.  Lida treats everyone like family, but with respect and privacy.  She makes it all clean and comfortable for the 10 residents she and her staff care for.  She was a registered nurse, and is a great patient advocate, she understands meds and the aging process -  coordinating well with doctors, while at the same time  also spending time with the residents herself, making them all feel special.  If you have any questions or want to hear more, please email me at lsscott@mac.com, as I know how hard it is when trying to find good care.

5	Such amazing home services! I have had the pleasure to visit each home chatting with the employees, residents and the owner Lida. Beautiful landscaping and everyone is treated like family! I wish there was 10 stars to rate them! :)
