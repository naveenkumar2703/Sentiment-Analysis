5	Best pizza I've ever eaten!  If you like your pizza loaded with fresh ingredients at an affordable price, you will love Papa Murphys!
4	I don't know about the best pizza I've ever eaten part. For fast good for your kids type of pizza that you have to bake yourself. I would have to say its pretty decent. They run a clean operation in the two different locations that I have been in.
3	I have tried Papa Murphy's about 8 years ago or so, I couldn't even remember if I liked it or not.  We received a coupon in the mail for a free large pizza so after a long day of running errands & shopping we decided to just grab a pizza for dinner.  The young guy behind the counter was friendly but they were out of breadsticks, how do you run out of breadsticks?! The salads didn't look too fresh so we just decided to stick to the pizza without any sides.  It took about 5 min from when we walked in to when we walked out with our pizza, not bad.  As for the actual flavor, I thought it was just okay.  I noticed their prices, about $11-14 for a pizza that you still have to cook.  Call me silly but if I'm paying normal pizza prices, I'm wanting a pizza that is already cooked...especially since that means I have to heat up my kitchen in this PHX heat!
