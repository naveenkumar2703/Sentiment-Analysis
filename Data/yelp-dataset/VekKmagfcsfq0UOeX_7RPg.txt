4	This has become my local haunt for lunchtime goodness. I'm limited to commenting on the soup, which is without exception really good, and the morning rolls, which are excellent. But every time I make a pit stop here I always admire the tasty looking main courses and meals. There is loads to choose from sandwich wise, and some seriously yummy looking cakes up for grabs too. Grab a loyalty card and rack up a freebie for every tenth spend. Nice! There are a few tables to sit in at also, so if you want a wee sit down there's space to relax. Best part is probably the lovely, friendly staff. This place is always really busy, so I think it must be a local favourite.
3	My usual lunch time haunt had run out of tomato soup, so I wandered off looking for other options. Loaded was on my way so I popped in. They were offering 2 different soups, one of which was thai chicken with rice so I asked for a cup of that. The soup was alright but there was no thai element to it, so that was a minor disappointment. This seems to be a very popular place, and I can see why They offer a variety of options to choose from, anything from sandwiches and baked potatoes to meatballs and macaroni cheese if you fancied something more substantial.
