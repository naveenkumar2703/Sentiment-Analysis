1	I've overlooked several mistakes by this company. I've been delivered incomplete meds, not told about it in advance. I've ordered several days in advance and the meds don't come on the day specified. I've Ordered several days in advance and on the day they are supposed to be delivered, I CALL them at 5:30pm asking where are they???? After being on hold for about 7 min the manager (Jerry) get's back on the line and says that they have to order one of the medications. It is NOT OK to not inform someone who takes meds that are important to take daily and let them run out because you couldn't deliver on time or communicate that you wouldn't be able to. At least then I could have gone somewhere else and gotten them. Again, I overlooked these types of issues several times in the 4-5 months that I've used them.
1	DO NOT use this pharmacy!  These people are incompetent, especially the "manager" Jerry who does not even return customer phone calls.  It has been 3 days and many, many phone calls and I still do not have my Rx.  I will never use this pharmacy again.  Don't waste your time...find a different compounding pharmacy!
5	I drop by here very often and they have been really helpful to me. The people are very friendly and nice. They deliver on time and whenever the medication is going to be late, I always receive a call from them and they let me know. Overall, my experiences with this pharmacy have been good. They also deliver medication to me whenever or wherever I needed it.
1	This is the worst pharmacy I have ever worked with. First, they were unable to process the insurance info, then they promised the meds. tomorrow and then couldn't do it. We talked to a total of 4 people and kept getting put on hold. Wow, what a lousy exercise in futility. Called vons we got in one call he did all the work.
