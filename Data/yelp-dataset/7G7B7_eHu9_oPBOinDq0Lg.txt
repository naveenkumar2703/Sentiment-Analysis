5	Small place, but has a lot to offer!The owner is there EVERY DAY! Even on holidays like Christmas!She's very nice, and if she doesn't have something you want, she'll personally go find it somewhere for you!If you're ever in that area, stop by, you'll always find something you need!
3	This isn't a true "Dollar Store" since much of the merchandise is over a dollar.  I was after cheap bug spray to keep the ants at bay and all she had was a  can of Raid for $3.50 or so.  I did get a CD-R for a dollar and an audio tape also a dollar.  Those were both items I had been wanting.  There is a lot of stuff packed into this small store so you will probably find something you can use in all that.
4	If there's something that crosses your mind that you need and it can't be found at Fry's, this is a good place to go. For example, my husband likes to come here for some fake flowers for his parents' graves and there's not a Michael's craft store for at least 10 miles. We can get a bouquet here for $2. We have wanted to get those "touch lights" for years (now they're called moon lights and are no longer sold on TV). We found one here! It was $1.50. We took it. She asked us why only one? We explained it was the only one we found. She asked us how many more we wanted and she promised that she'd get another one for us. Very attentive!She has good costume jewelry (for kid's gifts), cheap lingerie!!!, sandals, a large utility section in the back (like bunji cords, car tail lights, clamps), cheap candles (you can go elsewhere and pay three times as much for candles), toy section and household items. It is cramped in here but that's what makes it fun to poke around. The owner's name is Ann and her daughter works with her. They are always smiling and will actually ask you if you need help.
