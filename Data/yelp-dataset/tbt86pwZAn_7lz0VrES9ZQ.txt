1	Miss Trisha is great, but I think Marilyn Bostic is a greedy witch.  She charged two months worth of classes to my credit card because it was expiring that month.  I'm sorry, but her convenience is definitely not worth a double payment.  Anyone who helps themselves to my credit card is vile in my book.We are back now after a year away.  My daughter missed dancing and the recital.  I hate giving money to this woman.I'm sure you can find a better deal and more decent people at a different dance studio.
5	My daughter started dance lessons here when she was three. This is a lovely studio with a caring staff. The recitals are beautiful and well-organized. I would recommend Miss Marilyn's studio for anyone who wants their child to love to dance.
5	My 2 daughters have been taking dance classes here for about 9 yrs. Our experience over the years has only been positive. Before settling on the Ballet Centre, I researched numerous studios, but have always been thankful we decided on this one. Although we drive further out several times a week to take classes, it is well worth it.  My daughters feel comfortable and the teachers are wonderful.  I have had many conversations with Marilyn and have found her to be warm and compassionate with her students.
5	My daughter has been taking a class with Ms.Trisha for almost a month now and she loves it.  She has learned so much!  Every week she comes home with a few more steps learned and a ton of confidence!  Now her sister is going to start taking classes too!  Thank you!!
