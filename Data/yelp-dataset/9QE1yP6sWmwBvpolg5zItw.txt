5	I am so thankful for this place, the customer service is really amazing, relaxing and friendly, price really affordable and they are always searching for you to feel really "bella"I have been doing Hair cuts, hair highlights, lipolaser, massages and facials... Really good!Worth t give them a try!
5	Having facials done at Bella Estetica is a treat!  Ivonne, the proprietress, is not only knowledgeable but is quite engaging and always very professional.  She makes you feel at home from the moment you walk into the door to the moment you leave with glistening, smooth skin.  Pricing is also, thankfully, reasonable.  I would not go anywhere else!
