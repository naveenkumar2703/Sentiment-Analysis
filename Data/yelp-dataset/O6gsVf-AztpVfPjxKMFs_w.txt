5	Stopped here for the first time and got more than I expected. A great big hug, a gift book for a client and an introduction to things I hadn't known about Arizona. Judith the owner is kind, very helpful and attentive. Told her what I was looking for and she helped me find it - didn't just point to a section. She went over and looked herself! Interesting store with some great things to give as gifts - or keep for yourself. I'll definitely go again.
5	What a wonderful and joyful place to visit. The owner, Judith is one of the kindess people I have ever met. She greats you with a big hug and hugs you again before she lets you leave the store (even if you don't buy anything). The way good no great customer service should be. When I leave this place I am filled with joy and happiness, and I can just feel my spirit at ease. I had my aura read while I was there, and it was all over the place (i.e.- stressed, depressed, worried and so forth). With just a few minutes with Judith, I let my guard down and opened up to her (she is just one of those people you feel like you can tell anything to) and not only did I feel the difference you could actually see the difference in the change of color of my aura. It is a wonderful place to shop again and again.
5	I have had the privilege of knowing Judith & this "Spiritual-Cosmic Crossroad" that is APOTU for about 10 yrs now. It is a place of Love & Acceptance & Knowledge. All seekers & souls are welcomed and the Light is always 'on'. Do your soul a favor & stop by to experience it for yourself. Namaste .....
