4	this is a decent little Mexican joint with a dash of American. Good burritos, chicken and fajitas. The free chip and salsa bar is nice and they have plenty of booze to choose from. I enjoy coming here on the weekends for breakfast as there is hardly anyone there and you can get a nice, filling burrito.This location inparticular has it's regulars and the people that work here are always friendly and accomodating. I always feel comfortable eating here.
4	Quite very good lil' neighborhood joint. You order your food at the counter but they do bring it out to you. They have special for every day of the week! Like today its Tri-Tip sandwich, pretty nice. Their margaritas are honest and good tasting, and bunch of different kinds of beer does not hurt either. However, we came there for their $.99 street tacos and were not disapointed even a little bit - tasty, fresh, warm, jucy, delicious little things! "I could be eating those whole day long, man!" - Is what one of my friends said. "When are we coming back?!?" - Was reply from the other. I also had been there before on my own for dinner, and it was delicious. Fact that meet (fish) is broiled instead of fried gives this place an lot of "Brownie Points" in my book. Or maybe its cuz mesquite broiled Mahi is so good? Or was it pork? No, wait! It was salmon! Yes, for sure it was that. Unless it was white fish or chicken. Ahhhhh......... Screw it! I give up. its all flippin' good.PS: Wait times are kinds longer then expected. BUT........ it IS worth it. However, i did dogged a star for that. There, now you know.
3	Great service, order at the counter, nice specials, good standards, ok salsa and fun ambiance. I have just never had anything that wowed me or tasted "just right" so I gave it three stars.
