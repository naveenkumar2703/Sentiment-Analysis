5	This review is for the Luxor location. Super cool service - very friendly and helpful. I wasn't checking any bags but needed to check into my flight and print a boarding pass but didn't have my reservation code. The employee behind the counter found my reservation and printed my boarding pass for me.Huge time saver!
5	This is for the Harrah's location.Bags to go was great!  All we had to do is take our bags down to the bell desk area.  They checked us in and printed our boarding passes.  They even told us what gate to meet our plane at.  They then weighed our bags and charged us $10 per a bag.  ALL of the bags arrived safely and on time at Dallas Love Field.  Bags to go gave my parents and I an extra few hours on the strip and hassle free traveling.  The staff was friendly and professional.  For anyone staying in Vegas this is a must.
1	Why give $10 a bag when i can leave $10 for ALL my bags plus carryons with a bellman for the day and know they make it to the airport? Plus i take care of the skycap at the airport with another $10 and i'm good!
