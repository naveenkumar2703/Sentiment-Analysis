2	I've received very good haircuts here, at a very good price.  The stylists are always very friendly.My complaint is they only have one person working weekday evenings.  They accept reservations, but there system just doesn't work.  Three separate times, I have shown up for my reserved appointment time only to find that they have no record of my reservation.Can't be that difficult.
2	I have been going to this location for a few years and have been satisfied with most of the visits. I liked that you could call ahead to see the wait time and get your name put on the list for a specific time. Recently they have stopped taking names over the phone and changed some of their hours.  This has made it a little tougher to get in and out for a quick hair cut. I'm sure this is the idea of some corporate big wig trying to make more money, but to the consumer and loyal customer it makes it hard to not just take my business else where.
2	My entire family has been going here for years until today.  I called ahead for apt as always only to be rudely told they only take walk ins now.  It seems like this policy changes depending on who answers when you call, which has become irritating as you no longer know what to expect.
