5	There are times when I look at a map and think I know where I'm going. Mostly, that's the case. On Saturday, when I made plans to have my vehicle emissions tested first thing in the morning...yeah, not so much. In fact, I was so angry that I couldn't find my destination that I was seething and really was hoping someone would start something with me. Which is odd because I try to be more passive. Once I finally returned home and realized I was a few miles off, I pulled up and found that my anticipated wait time was 6 minutes. Really? Six minutes and I was expecting to spend a good portion of my morning here? Awesome. The actual testing in quite painless. You're asked to turn off your car and release the gas cap cover. Then you stand there for five minutes, get your results and go. It's that simple! My only grumble was the loudness of the facility. I couldn't hear anything. But, still, after expecting the worst these guys delivered the best. If giving hand jobs was an exceptable form of gratitude, I'd be wearing part of these guys right now.

He then opened the booth letting me know how much it would be for the emissions and then I was done.  Then he said it was OK to go go back into my car emissions inspection passed and I was done.  I will surely go back there again and never go to the one on  Deer Valley and 5th Ave.  In case your reading this the one on Deer Valley and 5th avenue, inspector gave me the option to jump over to the passenger side while the inspection was being completed.
