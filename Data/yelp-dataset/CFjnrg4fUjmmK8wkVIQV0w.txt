3	I needed to stop at the ATM last night.  This is not inside the Lucky Center but rather along Trop.  It was easy in and out and I was on my way quickly.  there's not much else to review about an ATM machine.
3	Its a bank.. Most of the tellers are friendly they get you in and out. Get any questions answered.
5	Tons of Wells Fargos in the area but this is the only one open on Sundays (11-5) and open late till 7pm mon-sat. These are the Vegas conveniences I really missed when I moved.   It's a small, but full service branch nside an albertsons. Pretty long lines on a Sunday, but my teller was quick, friendly and super helpful
