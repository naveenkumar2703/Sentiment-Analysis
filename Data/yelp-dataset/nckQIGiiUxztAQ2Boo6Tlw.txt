1	Shit...but even E. coli wouldn't eat here. Bad food, horrible service and lousy selection of mass-produced beer. Like I said --keep walkin' --nothin' to see here!!--TB
2	It's an airport restaurant so we honestly weren't expecting much. It was a sit-down restaurant style and our service was fine. Honestly we just wanted the food to come out in a reasonable amount of time or for nothin major to be screwed up. As for the food, we got a Taco Salad and Turkey Sandwich. Food was typical standard faire so really it was good enough. I can understand the previous harsh reviews, by today was a typical dine at a restaurant in an airport. Limiting expectations was probably the best idea.
2	Relatively lazy service (can't get a refill on your coffee to save your life)OK food (no kids breakfast menu, though, so my kids had to split a regular entree)The "healthy" omelet I had was cooked in so much oil that I didn't feel so healthy afterwardsApparently, people regularly chew tobacco here.... at their table.... first thing in the morning... because when I asked for a paper cup (to give to my toddler) I was asked if it was to use as a spittoon, since that's what most people ask for them for.  Gross.

1	I ate at the to go stand in the terminal, and it was awful. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese, and I got a stale bagel with one small thing of cream cheese and nothin to spread it around.
