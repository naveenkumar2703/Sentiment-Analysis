5	My husband & I had our wedding ceremony and reception at Desert Foothills and we highly recommend it to others looking for a beautiful unique venue to host their event. The day was absolutely perfect, a large part thanks to the wonderful help we received from Lisa (one of the event coordinators) and the staff. Lisa was available to help with suggestions and answers to all sorts of questions over the past year and was great at coordinating all the linens/chairs/catering/clean up/etc etc the day of the wedding so I had nothing to worry about. We got our dinner catered through one of the vendors that has a partnership with Desert Foothills, Bobby Q, and the food was delicious. The venue itself is strikingly beautiful - gorgeous red barn, fire pits, and saguaros lining the whole property. It really creates a wonderful backdrop for a memorable event.
3	This was different.  Perfect for the groom who is apparently a total cowboy.  The guests wearing cowboy boots were smart. It's all dirt and gravel.  My stiletto Louboutins weren't having it.  (I'm a total city girl)  The sunset was nice against the cactus.  The bathroom had some flies.  The barn is spacious. Some heat lamps would have been nice to have outside of the barn.
5	Desert Foothills is a fabulous event venue and here's why:1. The barn is huge, beautiful and immaculately maintained. 2. The staff is lovely and extremely lovely to work with. Lisa and Courtney are amazing. 3. The price is right and they have a list of caterers at a variety of price points that clients can use for catering.4. The price includes bar, bartender (everything but the alcohol, which you provide, saving $$) and valet parking.5. The "Plan B" option for rainy weather is fantastic.  We do weddings at all types of venues and Desert Foothills is one of our very favorites!!
