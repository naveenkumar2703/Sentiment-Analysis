5	Surprisingly, It was very fast service. Now that's what I am talking about real customer service. Had a Sweet tea, Vanilla Shake, Mcdouble, Hot & Spicy Chicken and a medium fries.
4	This place is pretty good and has a great toddler play area.
1	Awful service.  Did not get my full order going thru drive thru.  Realized it after I got home.  Drove back and went inside to complain.  The guy actually tied handing me the bag of food that he forgot to give me after it had been sitting there for 20 minutes.  Asked for a refund for compensation, but they refused!
1	Horrible service.    Tried to call number and all it does is ring then goes to fax line.    Terrible place to go
3	Slow drive through
