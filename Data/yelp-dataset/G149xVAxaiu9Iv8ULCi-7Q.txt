5	Great service, knowledge and professional, with great pricing when compared to other estimates I got from other companies."
5	I was very satisfied with MK Electric.  I was having issues with the outlets in my house and a man named Del came to fix them.  He was very knowledgeable, honest and kind. He was also on time.  I did not have to wait all day for him to come by, unlike many other repair men.
5	I had MK Electric come out to my house earlier this week to do some new wiring for a ceiling fan, change out a dining room light fixture with a ceiling fan, and install a new outlet in my living room.  Adam and his partner (didn't get his name) arrived in the given time frame, and even texted ahead of time to say he would be arriving in 20 minutes.  They worked very quickly, and communicated with me throughout the process to let me know about any hurdles they ran into, or just giving me options on how they could fix my problems for me.  Both guys were super friendly, and professional throughout their afternoon at my house.  I was very happy with the work they did, and more importantly, the boss (my wife) was happy as well.I have other electrical projects on the to-do list in the coming months, and MK Electric will be the first company I call to do the work.
