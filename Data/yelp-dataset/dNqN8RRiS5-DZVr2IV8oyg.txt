2	Sauerkraut? For the Hot Dogs? Would you mind?
4	Have found from my own experience having driven to Las Vegas that the 7-11 gas stations have had better gas prices than any other gas stations near my son's place.This is nothing fancy, a gas station attached to a 7-11, but then you get the benefit of getting a slurpee when you gas up.
3	THE MONEY WE SAVED ON GAS WAS SPENT ON SNACKS INSIDEGas was a little bit cheaper at this station ($3.91/gallon) and it was within ten miles of the car rental facility so we stopped here for a final fill-up before returning the vehicle.  Of course, the first pump we stopped at wasn't accepting credit cards at the moment. We reparked on the other side of the station and filled up. About the same price we pay at home - glad we didn't have to do much driving while we were in Vegas!Lots of snacks and goodies inside. We bought one final soda to drink before the security line in the airport. Also, I asked the ladies at the register if I could fill my water bottle with ice and they said yes. Very nice. :)
5	I come in here at least twice a week to get a redbull or some gas before work. Rox is so sweet every time I come in. Great customer service.
3	Good gas pricing, but there are only a few pumps and none of them print receipts at the pump, which means you have to walk inside everytime. We had 2 cars at 2 different pumps and neither of them printed a receipt or even tried to. I just hate it when you have to go in and wait in line just to get a receipt...unless they had a separate line just to print receipts!
3	I stop on for gas and the occasional Rockstar. Staff is not friendly in an eerie sort of way.  But I work in the building behind it and it's convenient so just try my best to get in and out. Otherwise very clean and well stocked. Except needs better wine selection.
