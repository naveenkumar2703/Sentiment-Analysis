1	Wow! Tastes just like the gyros I've had in Chicago! In my high school cafeteria!Blech. Gyro meat had the taste and consistency of pulped newspaper and seemed to be comprised entirely of nothing but pure fat and ground-up unwanted animal parts. Can't say I've been in their establishment (I got delivery) but that pressed "meat" tasted more like it was rolled off of a steam-press factory line than as if it was cut off of a spit. Save yourself some money and buy a box of frozen, pre-cut gyro meat. It'll compare in quality and probably taste better too.Fries were greasy, soggy, floppy, and all-around nasty, as if they had been sitting out for hours if not days. Think microwaved fast food. The guy who took my order sounded like he had just taken ten hits off of a gravity bong.Seeing as Athens Gyros caused me to spend the rest of the day puking, I won't be ordering again anytime soon.
4	Good, affordable and fast delivery!
2	I thought since they had 4 stars on grub Hub they would be somewhat good. I was wrong the chicken Alfredo was like soup the Alfredo wasn't creamy at all and had no flavor. The small salad was good and fresh had to add some positive in their. I wouldn't order the Alfredo again but I do believe in giving second chances
1	No longer taking online orders through grub hub..... Lost me.
