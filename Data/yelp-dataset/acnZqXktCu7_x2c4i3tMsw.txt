5	This place has saved me from dry nights on numerous occasions. The sign faintly resembles one of a Harley Davidson merch shop, but upon entry, your greeted with plenty of boozin' options. The vodka assortment is also pretty top notch. I've managed to score some unique domestics and imports. I've often been confused by the age of some of their patrons, but then I remember that this is also a bait shop, and that there is a rare few of today's use that actually go fishing. Ew... worms.Anyway, the location of this place is another reason I'll continue to visit. For those who haven't been to Madison, 9 PM is when alcohol sales come to a screeching holt. If you're hanging out on the east side, the clock strikes 8:45, and you've realized that you started to sweat because you don't know if you can make it down Willy St. in time on a Friday night, don't worry. Just head a bit more east. Harley's may be a little out of the way of the party sector, but you're guaranteed a traffic-free, open road, complete with the freedom to change lanes. You'll have no problems getting here fast enough that you won't turn into a pumpkin.
5	Nice people, not a bad selection, and close to home. If I'm running low on supplies and it's to early to call it quits, this is where I go!
5	I love Harley's, but my liver hates it. Booze and Bait,what more do you want?
5	I love that you can buy a bottle of tequila and a worm separately at this place. Super nice guys at the counter always, good selection, and fair prices. You can't really do much better.
