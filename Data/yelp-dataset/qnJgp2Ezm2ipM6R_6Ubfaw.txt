5	Great friendly staff. They have the same set of servers everyday. My friends and I are regulars and the ladies that work there know our orders by memory. They repeat them even before we've made up our mind. They're very nice and take care of you well. They even help me work on my spanish, I appreciate that. The salsa is runny. This is a Salvadorian place so I'm guessing that's how they make their salsa. It's still good. The pupusas are FANTASTIC! I always get the rubuelta. It has everything (pork, beans and cheese). One pupusa, rice and beans is $4.50! Can't go wrong with that.
5	My friends and I eat here at least once a month.  We always get the pupusas revueltas.  Love their curtido (cabbage slaw) and salsa roja to go with them.  The fried yucca and chicharrones are also a must to go with our pupusas.   We've made it a point to try pupusas around town and we always come back to Esmeralda's.  You can't beat the price!  I've also gotten a few pupusas to go and they're great heated up the next day as well.
5	The food is delicious. The staff is friendly. You can get an absurd amount of food for $20, which in Vegas dollars is practically free.Our favorites are the yuca con chicharrones and the pupusas revueltas. Great stuff. You should go.
2	The food was okay.....even the chips were cold!  I drove out of my way to this location to eat the food and I was disappointed!   It should have "hit me in the head" to think that maybe this restaurant would NOT have good Salvadorian food since they were serving "Mexican" style tortilla chips.   Fresh Salvadorian hand-made tortillas with butter or cheese would have been BETTER!  Oh Well!
5	My husband and I love this place. We go here when we need to time to just talk and take a breath. The food is great and the staff are great at remembering faces and what you do and don't like. Sweet, respectful people who work here. And the horchata is wonderful. Divine.
