5	Cute store with lots of cool clothes!  Kelli the owner is super cool & nice.  Check it out, it's a great place on State Street!
4	Somewhat a new addition to the State Street boutiques, I went for the first time last weekend and bought some great stuff!I think this place offers some spa services as well, but I ony am reviewing the shopping.  When I walked in there were tons of cute, lacey panties by Honeydew in cool popsicle and lime patterns.  The walls are lined with handbags in all patterns...these make cute bookbags...they have things like hearts and monkeys.  There are adorable fitted graphic tees, jeans, tanks, and casual shoes and dresses.  There is also fun jewelry such as chunky rings and shell earrings.The best part....the dressing rooms are in a little room with curtains and a comfy couch faces the rooms.  Mirrors are on the side.  You can try clothes and put on a little fashion for friends.I found some great deals on the sale racks and they have lots of clothes by Free People...one of my fave brands!
5	What happened!?Such a great store that is now closed.  Please let us know if this store has moved - if anyone knows!
