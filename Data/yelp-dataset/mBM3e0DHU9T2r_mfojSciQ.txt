4	Hubby and I just waddled in from the Sunday Buffet at Ross's. We met the husband and wife owners who were both very charming, and sat down to some great soul food including:*catfish (with a light cornmeal breading, these flash fried nuggets were simply the best I have ever had)*fried chicken (very well seasoned and delicious)*beef brisket (good flavor, could have been more tender, amazing BBQ sauce that tasted like a kicked up apple butter to me)*meatloaf (usually I am not a fan, but this was delicious, with very little filler)*seafood gumbo (decent, spicy, but too thin for Hubby's taste- he likes his file style)*mashed potatoes (boxed, but super smooth)*green beans (canned, salty and yummo, with a ham hock floating around in there)*spicy yellow rice with matchstick carrots (well flavored, beautiful dish)*cornbread (not sweet enough for Hubby, but I thought it was awesome)*collard greens (Hubby liked them, but for me, they are still an acquired taste)*potato salad (good, mustardy Southern staple with pickle and egg bits)*coleslaw (more vinegary than creamy, with pickle bits, definitely zingy and totally delicious)*hot wings and green salad (which neither of us tried)*peach cobbler (lemony with lots of cinnamon, it was awfully sweet, but still had warm bits of still crispy pie crust)*lemon pound cake (super moist- this was our favorite of the desserts)With many more hits than misses, Ross's is a place we will go again for sure. The Sunday Buffet was a tad pricey at $16.99 each and $2.00 for a drink, but the atmosphere was bright and comfortable, and being able to choose among such a variety and have a little of just about everything made it worth it.
