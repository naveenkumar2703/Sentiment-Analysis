4	Probably one of the nicer McDonald's you'll visit. Newly remodeled, so you don't get that scuzzy feeling that's typical of the run-down locations. No ball pit for the kids...instead, hi-tech games. Solid 4 stars.
2	Someone needs to move the trash bins somewhere away from the drive thru I could smell cheese already.It's relatively inexpensive food.
3	McDs is a classic and with an extensive menu that includes a healthier fare, it makes it easier to go back time and time again.A huge plus that McDonald's offers is free WiFi. One doesn't even have to be a customer to pop in an use it and this feature makes for good public relations.Thanks McDs.HOWEVER, with all that's good, there is the down side and that's the kids' area. Filled with video games and interactive movies, kids are running and screaming through this area, still indoors, and dragging chairs everywhere they go. Oh if only the chairs had plastic feet, but they are gone, so one has to endure the metal against tile time and time again.So if you are serious about getting anything done on your laptop, go right next door to Chick-fil-A, where things are a little quieter.
