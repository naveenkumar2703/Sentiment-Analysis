5	My cousins and I saw the sign for this place while driving, and it boasted 350 flavors of tabacco. What the hell? That's crazy-talk.We stopped by, I'm pretty sure all of the employees were Native American. Come to think of it, I'm pretty sure this is the border of a reservation, since the Casino was a stone's throw away. Plus, ya know, the name of the place. We were carded right away, because apparently this 26 yr old looks 17. The place was packed! And, there's a drive-thru!There really are 350 different flavors of tobacco here. I didn't count, but I'm almost sure of it. My friend bought some flavored cigars, because it said Al Capone smoked them on the box. They have cool lighters too. Maybe I was just in awe because I don't see shops like this in San Diego. What a tourist.
3	This place has everything you cancer lovers need. Plus, no sales tax. Aww yeeahh.
5	Love the drive-thru. Trucked it on thru tonite and rolled out in less than 4 minutes with my super cheap carton of Marlboros and a smile on my face.  The lady at the window was awesome and funny.  Why pay more for name-brand cancer?
5	I'm not a smoker.  But my visitors are.  We were used to driving all the way up to SRPMIC for cheaper smokes until we found this shop - WAY closer!  Much more than carton cigarettes - loose tobacco, supplies, cigars ...Nicer shop!  Great prices!  No sales tax!  And a drive through (although was not open at the time we visited) ... worth the trip.
1	Love the price of cigarettes, but as soon as I walked in the door an older women workin there stairs at me then walks up asks me for I'd so I went to hand it to her and she snatched it out of my hand. She then gave me a very dirty look because my I'd is a California I'd. I walk up to counter to tell the other girl wat I wanted, and she had an attitude as well... Prices are great, but the people that work there are extremely rude. I'd rather pay the extra 3$ and go to a gas station.
