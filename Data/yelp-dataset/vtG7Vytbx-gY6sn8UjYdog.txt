4	Nice selection of modern styled furniture and accessories. Less appealing then Eurway way more appealing than Ikea.. kind of in between the 2. Very nice sales staff and they play French pop music which is very cool. If you're on a budget they have some pretty good bargains throughout the store.. the back corner also has many 75% off items. They had this very cool armoire there that I wanted though wherever am I going to fit an armoire in this place. The Mr would have never signed off.. I'm always buy now fit later!
4	Pretty cool Euro inspired furniture. modern, light, fresh in color. Not for your Victorian style lovers at all. If i had to gauge it i wold somewhere above Ikea and Euroway. If Ikea is Walmart, Euroway is Traget, then this is Macy's. We were looking for a chase forever and finally found one there. Were able to pick one of MANY custom fabrics for it too, none of that "What you see is what you get" boolshit. And actually got 20% off as well, as they have store wide sale happening right now. Did not know that but it took $119 off from already fairly priced item. "I like"
4	My husband and I have been big fans of this place for a while now.  Unfortunately, with their move to the bigger and "better" Scottsdale, we probably won't be visiting again.  We always made time to stop by here if we were ever in the IKEA area.  Their furniture is all wonderfully modern yet very classic.  I can see their stuff not getting dated very easily.  I love that you have the ability to personalize any upholstered piece of furniture and make it your own.  The back corner where they kept their clearance stuff was always fun, and there is always something good to be had back there.  The last time we bought a beautiful blue duvet cover for like 15 bucks.  We stopped by here on the last day of their big moving sale and we bought a wonderful rug from here for less than 200 bucks.  Too bad we won't be seeing EQ3 anymore.  Good luck in Scottsdale.
