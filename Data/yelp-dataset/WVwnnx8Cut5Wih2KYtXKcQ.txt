4	Beautiful church!!  We started attending mass here after they brought Jay Soto on as their music director.  He has beautiful voice and also plays piano.  We like Fr. Robinson the best - we've heard all of priests except for Fr. Sullivan.  This is not a cookie cutter church - it feels like a real church with the stained glass and the stations.  My husband is of the faith - not me and I'm not given a hard time for not taking communion like the other church we used to attend.I attend to hear the music and companionship for my husband.
5	As a member of the Catholic and Greek Orthodox Faith, I'm proud to be a member of St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church. I attend Mass here every other Sunday and often attend a mid week morning Mass. I love the traditions of the Church and always feel at ease here. Christmas Midnight Mass is a true joy -- Love the festive Christmas Holiday decor of our Church. As a gay man, I'm often ridiculed for my deep Catholic faith. My faith and beliefs are those of my own and between God and myself...and I'm thankful to share spiritual moments at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church.
5	I love this church, near the light rail and really pretty. It actually looks like a cathedral. Lots of parking, pretty inside and really clean. Mass at 5pm on a Sunday.
4	This is a very nice church. It is beautiful, though the top of the alter is a TINY bit gaudy.They say the nicean creed, which isn't the one that I know, but they do provide a program with it in.There were a lot of people wearing JEANS, which in Canada would be completely unacceptable. It was kind of cool to see such a relaxed church. The sermon really touched me and I enjoyed it, however I am under a lot of stress.The stain glass windows are beautiful!! The ceiling has these gorgeous tiny stained glass windows.Somehow, the host had a sort of citrus taste. Overall this is a good Catholic church. I think I will return.
