4	Just got my haircut this afternoon at Boss Barber Shop. I am very pleased with the results. I don't know the young lady's name who cut my hair, but she did an excellent job. She was like Leonardo DaVinci, and I was her Mona Lisa. She put that much care into her work. There was a little bit of a wait before I could get my haircut, but it was well worth it. I went at about 1:00 in the afternoon, and there were only two people ahead of me, already seated. This is a great Barber for the guys. They really know how to cut a man's hair. Complete with the neck shave, side burns, hot towel and back and neck massage, all for $12.
4	I went to their new location in Peoria and the barber manny was awesome. Line me up so good and cut the top perfectly. Can not complain. Finally no more super cuts
5	I've been seeing Manny for several years. He cuts a mean beard, is quick and efficient, and the price is very reasonable. Highly recommend the establishment, and Manny even more.
