5	This my first choice when it comes to the TONS of Big Lots in the area. Not the most organized or cleanest location but a far better food and drink selection. Rarely is it ever sold out of my favorites. I personally love Thomas Kemper soda which run around $5.00 or more for a 4 pack and Safeway. You can get them at this location for $2.99 a 6 pack. Better cereal selection with normal brands - not the Low Carb Count Chocula that didn't make the cut last year.
4	Buy cheap things here! Seriously though despite being in Mesa (I kid, I kid) this location is pretty good.
3	I like the variety of items. The food section has a lot of weirdo food items i like to come across.My biggest gripe is there is always a line, a real slow line. Might just be me, but on 2 occasions i put my items down and left..
