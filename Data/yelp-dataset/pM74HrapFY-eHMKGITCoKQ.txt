4	My Favorite Shop: I have been a long time fan of this company. It wasn't until a misplaced suite jacket led me to this location inside of Ceasar's Palace/Forum Shops that I realized how much I liked this store - especially this location. We entered the shop about half an hour before they were to close. After living in HI for so long I had misplaced most of my dress clothes. I realized my dinner & show reservations for the next night asked that men wear a jacket. Needless to say I needed help. I am not one for shopping. However, the selection & helpful staff were so great that I ended up with virtually a new wardrobe instead of just a jacket for the next night and happy about it. Good lighting helped me find just the right hues & colors. Wide designer selection provided the variety to dress well & not look like an ad for a specific designer. I am especially fond of the house brand for dress pants. The music was good. The staff here was wonderful. Helpful but not pushy. The man helping us had a good eye for piecing together outfits for casual & dress occasions. The sales associate even tracked down a cool drink for my girlfriend when needed. The oversized chairs were a nice addition to rest in while awaiting suggestions from the salesman. When I realized I had kept them there almost 45 minutes past closing I began my appologies & they assured me that it was their pleasure to assist. WOW! Many stores kick you out after a few minutes past closing & these men were as helpful & freindly as when we first walked in the door. The tailor even had my clothes ready the very next day. Great service. All in all a terrific shopping experience. I will most assuredly be shopping here again.
1	at first you think the clothes are good.  A pair of shoes I bought there actually tore in the back with-in the first 2 months.  They say everything is Italian made, wrong, pay attention, quite a bit is actually Made in China.
