3	I love innovative food. I hate mindnumbing bar food. So I was delighted to find this little tucked away Israeli restaurant in the middle of Summerlin.The place would be really cute except they've got some of the harshest, most glaring lights ever seen in a restaurant. That might be okay for lunch, but I was there for dinner. (Hey owners! Ever hear of a dimmer switch?!)First highlight was the bread! It's all homemade and warm and lovely. We also split an order of "Greekplant" which were thin slices of eggplant wrapped around cheese and pesto with these grilled sweet potatoes that were delightful.For my main course, I ordered the Halumi salad which comes with Mushroom, red bell peppers, scallions, spinach and cherry tomatoes over baby mixed greens all sauteed in light soy and dijon. topped with halumi cheese (deep fried). But they were out of halumi cheese and promised it would be wonderful with feta. I loved the first many bites but somehow as I continued to eat, the taste became cloying. I could enjoy this is a half portion with a sandwich, but I wouldn't order it as a main course again. Also, at $13.99, even though the portion was large, it seemed expensive for what it was.My date has the Tuna salad - Fresh mix greens topped with corn, cherry tomatoes, avocado, onions egg and our home made albacore white tuna. It was an unusual pink color...not sure why. It was very decent, but not something I'd go out of my way to eat again.Overall, if you're tired of the same old bar food, give Panini Cafe a try. I'd like to go back and explore the menu a bit further.
4	Delicious - the only thing keep me from giving it 5 stars is that that prices are a bit high and the dining atmosphere is pretty bad.The food is all homemade and FRESH.  Great bread, salads, and grilled vegetables.   I love their tomato sauces and salad dressings.  If you are willing to overlook how there isn't meat - you will not be disappointed with the food.  The restaurant seems a bit more lively at lunch, it is pretty empty at dinner time.This restaurant is closed during the Sabbath and Jewish holidays - I would always double check before I head down there.
4	This place is a serious find.  Other reviewer is right.  Dining environs are very basic, but it feels so much like it's in Israel (except no sea view and open air) that I let that go.Service is delightful and great israeli tunes playing.We had two wraps, medit and the salmon avocado.  Both were amazing, and both were served warm, which was a great surprise.My brother (who is in vegas visiting our mom with me) asked "what possessed you to go there."  And I said that in a town of booze and binges, you always know kosher restaurants deliver fresh and great ingredients.  More than true here, and also true that kosher standards carry higher prices.Don't come for a great bargain, but the sandwiches are splendid and it's a cool place to hang out even if not the most elegant spot on earth. After the overkill of the Vegas landmarks, this place is a calm, tasty respite.
4	Amidst the chaos, rubbish, and wonderment of Las Vegas, lies a quaint, friendly, and truly awesome Cafe. The food here is excellent. Room For Improvements: ServiceThe food was fantastic. You can taste the freshness of its ingredients with every bite. I ordered the Malawach Pizza. I relished in its ambrosial smells and tastes, and it left me craving more. It is a perfect hangover food, and is exactly what I needed early in the morning, before the big drive back to Los Angeles.  Another great aspect to this place is its commitment to vegetarian and kosher dishes. This is perhaps the reason why certain options on the menu are not available at a given time. Due to their commitment to freshness, quality and kosher foods, they will not serve the food unless it is without a doubt fresh. With no compromises. This place is certainty a well needed breathe of fresh air in the arena of healthy and quality restaurants. Their prices are reasonable, their dishes are delectable, their Israeli music is bumping, and their hospitality will always be engraved in my mind the next time I venture out to Las Vegas.
4	I was hesitant at fist. I stopped by and there was no one inside.But never judge a book by its cover as they say...I did not regret my choice of getting the salmon avocado wrap. It came with wonderfully delish cole slaw and thick cut potato fries. Scrumptuous from beginning to the end.Left me wanting more.
3	Alas, this place is under new ownership. Food is similar, though some great israeli items went missing.  Still good quality.  Bizarre change, though is the prices. They make absolutely no sense.I'm always prepared to pay more for kosher than not, that's fine, but it's most relevant where protein/meat/fish are concerned.  I can't comprehend any universe where a veggie wrap with goat cheese is $14.99 for lunch.  They tossed the old hummos wrap and now it's just a hummos/tilapia wrap ($17.99).  Bagel sandwiches are new, and they are about 25% cheaper than the wraps.  What sense can this possibly make.Oh, Panini cafe, people will NOT come to lunch for a $15 sandwich in a place that looks like a very basic sandwich/take out joint.  Come back to earth.  Find your footing.  Menu is apparently only 3 wks old. Our waiter (without prompting from us) apologized for the prices.Create a lunch menu.  Make it rational.
4	very vegetarian friendly, a little less for vegans. Awesome customer service! Super nice! The food is ok i guess, a little pricey for what you get (a small side of fries is $6!). The ravioli is a little too al dente for my liking but their hummus is the best i have ever had & they have an awesome drink called orangnana (sp.?). Bottom line is this: I will definitely return because of the great customer service and the vegetarian friendly menu, but i won't go too hungry, i consider this to be one of my lighter dining options.
4	I recently went to Panini Cafe for the first time after learning that it was kosher and vegetarian-friendly.  As far as I could tell, the menu was entirely pescatarian (or pesco vegetarian) -- meaning the only meat options on the menu were fish.  This is exactly the diet I've been enjoying for the past few months.  The fish on the menu included salmon, tuna, tilapia, and others.  My friend and I started with an appetizer of hummus and warm fresh pita bread.  Our hummus included sauteed onions, pine nuts, and olive oil.  It was delicious and we devoured it all.As a main course, I got the Ravioli Athens, which is ravioli tossed with garlic and basil and topped with feta cheese and kalamata olives.  At $16.99, It was a bit more than I wanted to pay, but it sounded so good I couldn't resist.  And I was not disappointed.  I loved the flavors, and I appreciated the fact that it was kosher.  I also refrained from eating the whole plate, so that I took about half of it home and enjoyed it for another meal later. My friend, who ordered the roasted Creamy Eggplant (which came with a house salad), was also pleased with her meal.  We had no problems with the service.I would definitely like to return and try some other dishes on the menu.
4	I've past by this place countless times wondering if it was open. So glad I finally went in. The sweet potato sandwich is sooo good......
5	Been here twice now, and both times the service and the food were amazing.  The restaurant has been making the rounds on Groupon, LivingSocial, and the other clones, as well as on restaurant.com, so you'll never pay full price for a meal here.  The servers are very friendly and have been nice enough to bring some water for our dog, which they allow on their patio.  The tuna crustini is amazing and as I am typing this, I wish I had another serving.  My girlfriend and I have tried a few dishes and have loved everything we've ordered.  A+ Panini Cafe!
2	The food here was amazing, went for a lunch on a Friday and had a tuna bagel sandwich and some hummus with onion and pine nut. I also had a lemonade/mint smoothie/iced thing that was refreshing and different. My wife had a delicious panini with mushrooms that was even better than mine. So the food was great, why the three star review you say? Here's why I give Panini cafe two stars: I have never felt so uncomfortable in a casual restaurant before. Our server seemed annoyed that we didn't know what we wanted right away. There is also a language barrier with the staff that no one else in the cafe seemed to have a problem with because we were the only non-Israeli or European customers there. The service level went down from there. Our food was slow to come out which is amazing to me because when we arrived, there were only two other tables occupied and we ordered sandwiches!Finally, while we were there two or three large parties showed up and we were kind of forgotten about. I had to ask twice to get our food boxed up and settle our bill.
5	Awesome kosher Israeli dairy meals, featuring an inventive menu and large portions that will fill you up, and breakfast is served all day. Even in Los Angeles which ranks as the kosher restaurant capital of America, there is nothing similar to Panini.The closest rival might be Pico Cafe, but Panini is even better both in terms of food and atmosphere. Panini even offers free ample parking in a spacious parking lot. You would need to go to Golan in North Hollywood to find a kosher restaurant that offers more parking.
5	The food is wonderful!  The portions are good and there is great variety.  Service has always been good.
1	A friend and I stopped here after purchasing a $30 deal from Living Social. We won't be coming back. The guy had attitude with us from the beginning. We were going to order some spinach ravioli, they were out of spinach, no big deal. But when we said we needed a minute with the menu to pick something else, he ROLLED his eyes and walked away annoyed. Whatever, we brushed it off. We ate the eggplant appetizer and hummus, they were good, and then ordered some chocochinos which were tasty. Our bill came to $22, the value of our coupon was $30.  The guy came to our table and told us we has to use the full value. We didn't want anything else. We told him to just charge something and be done, we thought it was pointless and silly to order food that we weren't going to eat. Then we ran into a snafu because he couldn't find the name on his paperwork. He took my friend's phone back to the kitchen with him to figure it out. It took him like 10 minutes shuffling through his paperwork. My friend had to track him down to get her phone back, and he started telling her if he can't find her name that we will have to pay the bill anyways, but his tone was hostile and argumentative. Totally inappropriate. The young lady that was our server was great. She was sweet, apologized for his rudeness over and over, and we tipped her $10 and left. We won't be coming back.
4	Great food. My wife and I had the Burekas filled with spinach and cheese as well as the Ziva filled with black olives and cheese. Totally awesome. This was the only Jewish Kosher restaurant that I have been in the United States, and I will be back. I bought a Groupon and got a great deal, which is what inticed me, but even without the coupon, this place has great value. By the way, I am not Jewish nor have I ever eaten such food, but let me tell you. I made a good choice that day :)This is a super casual cafe that serves sandwiches in the day time, and the same plus enrees in the evening. Food was excellent, but the service was slightly above average. There was one guy working in the front of the house when we showed up. There were only a handful of people in the restaurant. He told me his likes and dislikes, and I took his suggestion :) He was very freindly and helpful. However, a larger group, maybe 8 people showed up a little bit later, and I had to wait about 10 minutes to get my bill after I had finished my food. A  little annoying hence the 4 star revew rather than 5 stars.
5	Let's get this out of the way right now: This is a Kosher place and not TGI Fridays.So don't expect the same type of service. If you've traveled the world, you'll be ok. Don't expect fast, over-friendly service and all the bells and whistles. 1) Don't go there for atmosphere - It is in an non descriptive 3 stores "neighborhood mall".2) Don't go there if bad grammar and misspellings offend you - The menu and signs are riddled with "foreigners" version of American English.3) Don't go there if you're in a hurry.Now, that we put all of this behind us...The food is outstanding. This is (what I assume) a great Kosher place, from their menu and the fact that it is always filled with Israelis. The menu will be limited with the types of food you get (Kosher, hello?). Don't expect a regular cheeseburger (It's a no-no)... but expect a delicious fish burger. Did I say that the food is great?The menu has extended over the years and I have yet to eat anything bad there.The portions are very generous and, truly everything is just tasty!As for the service? Effective. It is a small place with 1 to 2 Israeli waitresses at the most and this place can get crowded. They won't bring you the check unless you ask for it (Typically what happens in restaurants in the rest of the world). They won't rush you and they won't be fake. They will be friendly, but won't be your best friend. Don't go there for therapy, go there for great food and to take your time without someone asking you every 5 minutes, if your food is ok.Reminder: Closes Friday at Sundown and all day Saturdays.
5	get the mushroom appetizer i forget the namebut its stuffed with cheese and pesto sauce staff is courteous and prices are cheap.
1	The service sucks big time... we had to wait 20 mins for someone to take our order... we ask for water to start with and the glasses smell like fish... nasty... they kept bringin the wrong stuff... everyones food on the table came except mine... they messed up my order... seriously?? the place was a nightmare... food wasnt even that good... after the long wait for my food.. the guy said my food was complimentary... of course not... got charge... i had to reming the guy 3 times abt the ice coffee order which tasted like milk... no coffee... sucks sucks sucks... never go there
4	The Minty drink. They don't even correct me when I say it. I definitely recommend giving it a try.Whatever. I love Panini Cafe's Tomato/Avocado/Feta Sandwich. Its so basic, however the bread, freshness, and side salad really are a big hit for me. It is a bit expensive for a sandwich, so I probably visit Panini Cafe 50% less than I would have if the prices were lower. Its my 2-Month Treatyoself.
5	Quiet little cafe with amazing food. Had the portabello sandwich which came with a nice salad. It would be a little pricey, but it was enough for two. The mint lemonade drink is delicious! I'd go back for just that alone! Service was great, attentive, but not overbearing.
4	I'm in love with Panini... wish we had one in LA. The food is AMAZING.  Our server was really nice too.  The menu is enormous, but every time I've gone I have loved my dish.  The only negative... theyre closed on saturday nights... Come on Vegas... you really need to work on having something kosher open on a saturday night!!!!!!!!!!!!
3	I often end up here...but not by choice.  Kosher-eating family + limited Las Vegas kosher restaurants = many, many Panini Cafe visits.  It seems like every restaurant in Las Vegas serves meat, shellfish and bald eagle (kosher joke, ha ha?).The menu is dairy kosher (meaning they serve dairy but no meat) and focuses on mostly Israeli-style cuisine with some pasta and sandwiches thrown in for good measure. I generally order the Creamy Eggplant (roasted eggplant with marinara and cheese), hummus (soo good) or the Nicoise salad (okkayyy).  They also serve fish if you're lookin' for some protein.Overall, the food is decent and healthy but, I wouldn't come here if it wasn't Kosher.Please note that if you wear a red halter top to this restaurant you're going to get some HARD and COLD stares.  It caters to the Orthodox of Summerlin.  They are also closed from Friday evening and all day Saturday.
1	No breadNo mealNo waterPotatoes when asked for noneRudeLiterally ordered food and never received it.  Everyone else in my party did, but I was somehow forgotten.  When I inquired on the whereabouts of my food, the server actually ignored me...twice.  THen, they charged me for the entree I never received.  Unbelievable.  NEVER going back.
4	I love the pizza.  Onion and pepper pizza from here is absolutely delicious. Reason for only 4 stars is thwy dont know how to take directions. There is always something missing. Which is bad when its $20 for 1 pizza.Twice ive ordered a pepper and onion pizza and twice its come with only peppers. Or ive ordered lite sauce and its extra saucy.The actual inside of the restaurant has a very elegant but simple decor. Usually empty when I go.
5	staff was incredibly nice. food is so amazingly good. the best dish we had was by far the stuffed mushrooms. we could not get enough of those. if the chef is reading this, i MUST have the recipe. i keep trying to remake them but i haven't a clue how...the waitress suggested lemonana (green drink) and although i was skeptic at first, i'm so glad i tried it!! i wanted to go back JUST to get that drink (and of course for the mushrooms). pasta was great, eggplant ok. it's a local place so we chatted up a couple and sat there for over 2 hours! such a pleasant atmosphere.
5	One of the major highlights of my trip to Las Vegas is always going to eat at Panini! We eat there two to three times each trip, and I wish they had a place this yummy in Los Angeles! The french onion soup is delicious. I also love the ravioli. They have a great Israeli breakfast, too. The atmosphere is cute, and it's always an enjoyable experience. Highly recommended!
5	The shakshuka was off the hook! Great place, friendly staff, nice atmosphere. We enjoyed it very much. The best dairy kosher restaurant in Vegas!
1	One star only because we weren't actually assaulted when we walked through the door. Never even ordered food. Went to wash my hands and there weren't any paper towels, which means the men were not going in there often enough to wash thier hands to notice. Turned around to walk out of the bathroom and spotted one of the biggest cockroaches I have ever seen. Me and my daughter walked right out. Which meant they had no customers, we were the only ones in there. Do yourself a favor avoid this place.
1	ARE YOU SERIOUS!? Growing up in Israel i know israeli food and these guys are liars if they say they know what israeli food even is! The service here sucks! As soon as inwalked it it took 10 minutes for someone to notice me! I order the malawach... Theyre out! I order a pizza... Apparently no more cheese... I order an omelet and it takes 15 minutes?Bad service. Bad attitudes from the owner that approached us after too apoligies but ended up yelling at us... DONT GO HERE
5	Delicious Delicious Delicious...wanted some of everything on the menu!!!!
5	As the kosher options in Vegas are limited, I frequented pretty much all of the options. This spot was easily the best kosher option. Highly recommended!
1	I'm no shiksa, but I'm pretty sure "kosher" doesn't translate to "we're going to shaft everyone with outrageous prices because we're a niche market!" And yet, that's pretty much what you sign up for when you walk in the door here.Don't believe me? For a bagel, wrap, or panini sandwich, you can expect to spend $12-20. I can get a gourmet burger at a celebrity chef establishment on the Strip for these prices.Their "Israeli" menu also boasts several pasta, pizza, and ravioli dishes, but go around the corner to the shwarma place for better shakshuka. And you can get the exact same burekas at Max Market two blocks away, for $1 each instead of $10.Unimpressed by what I saw on other diners' plates, I opted for the stuffed mushrooms. For just shy of $9, I received an order of five- considering they were roughly $2 per mushroom, they didn't seem fresh and were basically the same fried mushrooms you can get at any bar. The only thing "stuffed" about them was the scant teaspoon of white liquid inside that vaguely tasted like pesto.Service was polite, but quality doesn't justify the completely absurd prices. This is a completely average cafe. I can't even honestly call it an Israeli restaurant, kosher or otherwise.
3	I stopped here for lunch.  I had planned to have breakfast at the nearby Nacho Daddy which was supposed to be open but wasn't.  After finishing some errands, I landed at Panini Cafe, a place that I've wanted to try for awhile.There were only two tables, including me, occupied most of the time I was in this small restaurant.  I knew it was a Kosher restaurant but I didn't understand the menu until I read Krista N.'s review.  (Thanks Krista!) I ordered the antipasti sandwich, a panini with grilled vegetables--eggplant, red peppers, mushrooms, and tomatoes--grilled in olive oil and Mediterranean spices--and topped with feta cheese.  The sandwich came with a small salad of iceberg lettuce with roasted red peppers and cucumbers.  I also got a cup of coffee.  It's Danesi Italian coffee.  Service was good as it should have been with so few people in this small restaurant. I was not offered a refill on coffee which surprised me.  I agree with the others that the prices are high and I think I'll try one of the things I was going to get by going nearby and getting it at and adjoining restaurant.It was interesting for me to see a Kosher restaurant and see the men wash their hands.  The sandwich was OK but I won't hurry to get. back.
5	One of my favorite places to eat, the decor is unique and welcoming, and the staff are always a delight. The menu is well thought out and the food tastes home cooked. You will leave satisfied without a huge price attached. Very reasonable by Las Vegas standards. Also tried the Jewish doughnuts for Hannunkah and they are delicious !!
1	I used to love this place, i dont kbow what changed, but the food tasted horrible, and when I tried to return a Salmon that the flavor was too strong (and I hardly ever return anything) and we didnt like it,  waitresd called me a thief. At  the end , they dindt charge     me for the salmon but they say I was steeling
