5	Excellent service very helpful and flexible with their packages. lots of tanning beds, that are sparkling clean. Cute shop inside the store as well.
1	Take your business elsewhere. I have been a longtime member through now the 3rd owner of this establishment and they just lost our business because of the Manager, Gina. Her unwillingness to honor the free upgrade that I had earned just cost them my membership as well as my wife's membership. We constantly upgrade at an additional cost. Gina's refusal to honor the free upgrade that I was due has now cost your company way more than the 7 or 8 dollar fee that you charge. Horrible customer service. I do not blame any of the staff for our cancelling our memberships. The staff has always been friendly and helpful. The sole blame as to why you have lost our business lies with your manager Gina. Her attitude and unwillingness to do the right thing has cost you our business. Gina had 2 chances to fix the situation, 1st with me before I cancelled my membership then 2 hours later when I brought my wife in to cancel her membership. The first phone call with the owner didn't go very well, the owner actually hung up on my wife ! The owner did call back in about 10  or 15 minutes with a much kinder tone and attitude ( probably after realizing how much money we spend there )  she offered an apology and some free upgrades. To little to late. We will spend our money on businesses that appreciate loyal customers.
