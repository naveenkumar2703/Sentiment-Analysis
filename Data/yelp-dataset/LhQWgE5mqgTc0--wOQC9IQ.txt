5	I love Carvel ice cream.    Growing up on the East Coast, Carvel was our go -to ice cream place.   However, after living on the West Coast for many years, I went without Carvel for a long time.   Boy was I happy when I first saw Carvel in the C terminal of McCarran.   The soft serve ice cream is just wonderful.   Will I be back?  Heck yeah!
2	The ice cream Sunday I got was tasty but the service was poor.  They were out of vanilla, the cash register wasn't working and I got the feeling that the cashier didn't want to help me.
3	Pretty average ice cream. The said, you drop extra Reeses Cups in dirt it would taste good.
4	So what does he want for dinner but ice cream. It's okay, we are adults and stuck in a Las Vegas airport, so it actually makes sense. He ordered a soft serve ice cream in a cup with butterfinger like crumbles everywhere. Whatever makes you happy...
