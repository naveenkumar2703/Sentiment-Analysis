4	I enjoy banking with Wells Fargo.  Their staff is friendly, they have plenty of locations, and they have always treated me well.This location is convenient for me to stop by when I'm going to the gym.  It has a drive-thru and a couple of ATMs on the exterior near the front door.  The bank is always clean and the people at this location always greet me with a smile.Will I return?  As long as I have money in the bank.

3	I was at the Starbucks in the Trails Village Center and needed to stop at the ATM at Wells Fargo.  There wasn't a single car in any of the three lanes even the one with the ATM.  That's almost 4 stars without thinking.This is an OK place, but it's not in my neighborhood and it's a bit of a pain getting in and out with the traffic coming in and out of the Trails Center.I have lived here over a decade and this is my first check in here says something.
3	No line today.   Pleasant teller.   Still hits you in the face with fragrance but aside from tha a ok
1	I don't like this bank.  Not happy with their hours, their website, bill paying service, or especially their mobile app.  They are the biggest bank in Las Vegas, but their technology is pathetic.  The only reason I have an account there is because I used to use Wachovia, which I loved.  They swallowed them like Pac-Man and they inherited my account.  I continue to use them for one reason only:  they are one of the few banks with branches close by that have safe deposit boxes.  Otherwise, I'd be out of there in a heartbeat.
