1	Do NOT go here!  It used to be Taste of India or something like that.  I went out of my way on a weekly basis to go there.  Until just last weekend.  Ugh.  The pakoori were plain old fried veggies.  The Chicken Tikka Masala had chunks of...something white.  The chicken itself seemed ok (how can you screw up tandoori???) but I will never, EVER go there agin!NE corner 32nd St and Greenway.*sigh*
1	I fully agree with Amy D. --- this place SUCKS!!! Definitely the worst Indian restaurant in the valley and perhaps the states.
1	I'm suprised this place is still in business. This place used to be "India Palace."  The owners relocated to a brand new establishment at 35th and Bell which has a much nicer ambience.  The owners then decided to make this old location "Zest of India" which was supposed to be their cute way of offering a variety of styles (north and south) indian food. Instead, this place has become a joke. It's a mediocre cheap Indian restaurant.  I'm honestly suprised this place is still in business. Hey, when the non-Indians are ripping on this place, you know it's bad.
