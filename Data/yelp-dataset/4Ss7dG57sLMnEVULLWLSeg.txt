5	Well, I generally don't shop at stores like this, but since my husband was feeling generous and our Christmas Card theme this year happens to be the "big pony" polo player, this seemed like the next place to go to since the outlets were low on "big pony" polo players for women.Customer service was amazing, our salesperson was Brenda. I usually don't like it when sales reps shadow me where ever I go but this time was kinda different, she was very genuine and sweet. I know that they usually have a commission that they are working towards but she didn't ever make me feel Ike that at all. The dressing rooms were filled with all the vintage decor that I love! It's kind of setup like a bridal boutique with multiple mirrors and a couch, the fancy kind too! And I hate how I have to change in the room then come out each time with each garment to ask my husband for his opinion, they actually allow your companion to sit in the dressing room with you.I was able to find what I wanted and had an amazing shopping experience, I'd definitely come back.
1	Eh.  Online is just as easy.
4	Good size Ralph Lauren store, with solid mix of various RL lines- Polo, Sport, Purple Label, Black Label, etc.  Although The Shoppes at the Palazzo can be a bit snooty overall, the staff here tends to be more down-to-earth (Chris M. was especially great- helpful and nice). This mall also tends to be a bit slower, so you can often find great deals here at the end of sale times.
