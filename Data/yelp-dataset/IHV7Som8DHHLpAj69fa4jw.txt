4	My jet boat has been patiently waiting for me to fix it for about a year now.  Yesterday was the day, but lo! There was a swarming bee hive inside the gunwales and under the engine hatch.  Combat Bugs came today right on time and took care of the bee removal.  They have been here before to remove another beehive, so this was my second experience with them.  They recommended that if I keep the boats sitting for an extended period, that I put pieces of "Hot Shot" available @Home Depot in a couple spots inside the boat.  They are friendly, professional, no-nonsense, and experienced.The service cost $95 and comes with a 3-month guarantee.UPDATE 9/30/10:  About 100 bees from a different hive came back to retrieve the honey and the honeycomb that they couldn't initially see inside the boat.  Combat Bugs came back to kill the bugs on guarantee, but bear in mind that "bee removal" and "honey removal" are two separate charges.  Bee removal is $95 and Honey removal is around $200.  I'm taking away one star because the worker didn't notice the huge amount of remaining honey on his first visit.
1	Really great advertising, too bad you don't return your phone calls. Paid for 3 trips to rid us of ticks and fleas, you claim a 30day guarantee AFTER 3 paid trips, then don't return or answer calls (I guess your caller ID kicked in). THats' ok, we used Bulwark who stand behind their guarantee on trip 1. FINALLY, we are getting relief from the bugs. AT $68 bucks a pop, you couldn't even get rid of the ants roaming around here.. Your how they say? "get what you pay for"
