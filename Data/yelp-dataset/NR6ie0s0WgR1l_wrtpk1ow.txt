1	Worst service I've ever gotten at a 7-11 in my entire Life !! Walked in to purchase a 12oz Frappacino and a bag of chips. Stood at the counter for 5 mins while other customers began to line up behind me. No one at the counter or anywhere else in the store.  An indian-looking lady finally emerges from the back room totally focused on her smart-phone and sits down and continued to play with her phone totally ignoring the customers at the counter !!! One older customer leans over the counter and yells "Hello !!!!" she continued to ignore him ! After the 3rd time she finally looks up with a blank stare. At that time I slammed my merchandise on the counter and left the store. Unbelievable !!
3	I've been in this store a few times but mostly all at night or early AM. I have never have had any issues with service. It's conventionally located to home. It's open 24/7 & has most things one may need. Prices are a little more expensive vs Wal-Mart but you pay for the convenience!
