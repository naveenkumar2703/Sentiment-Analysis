4	Quick service. The employees actually seem happy. Bathrooms always clean. I prefer this Taco Bell over others because their outside deck is huge and shaded. Lower the price of limeade and I might actually get one.
3	Lunch on the run!  This is a real nice, clean location.
5	One of the best Taco Bell's I have been to.  Ultra friendly Carl and staff made my visit a pleasure.  Food came out fast and hot.  Tortillas were soft and tostada shell was crispy!  Don't know what else you could want out of a Taco Bell.  Clean too!
5	Taco Bells all serve the same food in the US. However the employees, location, and cleanliness all vary. This is one of the cleanest TBs I've been in! One HUGE difference is Carl, a 3-year employee, who knows what customer service is.  Even with the transient type person was greeted and handled professionally. He offered him a water cup when he said he had no money. Carl picked up everyone's trash, greeted everyone that came in and left.  That's an employee that's hard to find in any fast food business and in most customer service businesses. Not too sure of the location as we are from out of town. Clean outside and in, Carl is the best!
5	Eat here whenever I crave a good chalupa. Staff is very good. I have been here a lot and I never had an order wrong. Food is fresh and drive through is very fast. I have met a lot of great people driving up to the window. Very friendly and personable. But not the type to talk your ear off.
5	Whenever I visit my family in Arizona, I make it a point to stop in here as the employees are friendly, the food comes fast and the dining room & restroom are always clean. My compliments especially for Courtney for a great customer service experience.
