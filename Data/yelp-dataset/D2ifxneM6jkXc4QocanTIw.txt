4	I've recently went to Arizona for a wedding and decided to go get my nails done and to get some highlights. I pondered upon Hiline and gave it a go. Must I say, I am incredibly impressed. The shop itself has an extremely great environment and the staff was super friendly. The prices are quite reasonable as well. I went to go get gel nails as they last a tad longer. They had great color selections and Susan did an amazing job. And as for my highlights, they did a wonderful job as well. It had great dimension and was done so meticulously. It was better than what I had expected and I got so many compliments on them! I'd definitely come back.
2	Last Thursday I visited Hiline for a regular pedicure and a fill on my acrylic nails. I called ahead to ensure that they had an availability, seeing as though my usual salon was too busy (and I can never remember to make an appointment). The day after I got my nails done, the corner broke off my thumb nail from simply running my fingers through my hair. Also, the gel polish (which usually stays on my nails for easily a month without chipping or peeling) on both of my index fingers and the broken thumb nail chipped and then peeled completely off. I also wasn't pleased with the look of the polish around the edges, near my cuticles. The fill and shaping on my nails was acceptable (except for the broken thumb). While the polish on my toes looks great, the nails were not cut evenly or short enough. For the price of $23 (I added the callous removal for $5) the pedicure was affordable and I only had minor issues. Their prices are great! But you get what you pay for. I was also a little disappointed in how limited their selection of gel polish was.Unfortunately, due to the state of my nails I won't be returning to Hiline and I may need to learn to make appointments with my normal salon.
