4	Able to schedule an apt, pretty quickly--less than 3 days away to have some moles checked out. Will let you know, how the visit goes- demeanor, promptness, cleanliness, etc. But, so far so good. 9-22-09--went to the office, everything was spot on- demeanor, promptness, cleanliness, etc... He said that my moles were fine, but keep an eye for them; and that dermatologist are looking for the "level of sun exposure" that an individual can absorb (for example a fair blue eyed blonde cannot absorb as much as someone with my background- Filipino). Suggested, I use Blue Lizard sunscreen and creates his own comic books. Totally recommend him. Will use him again, no problem.
5	Demeanor, promptness fine.  Has treated quite a few skin problems with excellent success.  Highly recommend.
1	I went in to Dr Lines for a skin cancer screening on June 6th and he found two pre-cancer spots and froze them off, one on my arm and one under my left eye. The spot on my left eye cause swelling so I stayed home from work the following day. Because I drive a commercial truck, I needed a doctors note to return to work after the swelling went down. When I called Dr Lines on the phone afterwards for a return to work note, he stated that if he had to write doctor notes for all his patients that that's all he'd been doing. He was rude and uncooperative for a simple doctor note for my work. I'll be looking for a different dermatologist.
5	Just came back to work from my visit to Dr. Lines.  The staff is totally sweet and helpful.  Dr. Lines is the greatest.  He came to me highly recommended and  now I know why.  Right to the point and explained it all to me so as I could understand what was happening.Thank you ever so much Dr. Lines and staff.....
