5	I've been meaning to review these guys for ages but was reminded the other day when The Man took his car in for its MOT.In short, they're honest and do a great job.  They won't make up (and charge) for unnecessary repairs, they'll do an excellent job on the repairs they do, and they'll be friendly and good craic when you're dealing with them.  They also have crazy good memories as they remembered that our car was making a funny rattle when we took it in for the MOT last year, but at that time they identified that the noise wasn't indicative of a problem and was nothing more than a nuisance.  When booking in for this year's MOT, the guy asked if we were fed up with the rattle and did we want it sorted - being cheap and not being bothered by it we said not to bother, but he just fixed it anyway with no charge.Shortly after last year's MOT, The Man took a speedbump too fast and knocked something loose under the car.  When he took it in for them to take a look, they fixed it for free.  Every time we return we walk away with more glowing stories of their service and ability.  Five stars all around.
