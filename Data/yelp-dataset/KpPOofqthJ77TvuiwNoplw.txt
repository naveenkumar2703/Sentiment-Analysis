3	This is the grocery store right down the street from my house.  It's ok.  It has whatever I need most of the time.
3	Great selection of stuff to eat. Self checkout so you can haul ass. Pharmacy is ok they seem to never have my meds and send me to 43rd and cactus every month. They have a chase  bank inside. The have a decent selection of liqueur and beer. They finally started stocking some organic products so my baby can buy her treats and milk here.
5	I've been shopping at this Fry's for years. But I got a strange and actually great response in that I get greeted by the meat dept person (lady) as I'm heading to the milk...opposite directions.. and she asks if you can't find anything let me know or have a question about meat..  Huh.. wait.. I was going for milk.. and let it pass.. but no sooner do I get a direct manager asking "How are you doing.. Can I help?" Again I let it pass.. but then do a double take... In NO store have I been asked within minutes together within seconds and NOT looking coordinated.. What most impressed me was me hearing the "manager", asking the next the person (was now behind me) met/saw... if they could help... I go by employee's at Fry's all the time, but to be asked... was a bit disconcerting, but nice...  I could get used to it very fast.
1	Worst customer service ever!!!! 30 minutes to get a money order at the money service desk! Really? ! Unacceptable! !! The lady was so unprofessional, she was not nice at all, didn't care about customers and was chewing gum with her mouth open all the time. Her name was Danielle.
