4	This has been my favorite location to get pizza in Madison since I was a child. It used to be such a treat to get those pizza twins and argue over the toppings with my sister and I always remember being thankful when i had it. Not much has changed since, other than the fact that I can afford it eat it when I want now! I probably order from there 5 to 7 times a month on average and I can't forget their slices which they have available from (11 to 2). I'm a fan of the inferno wings, hell all of the chicken there is above satisfactory in my estimation. The Zesty Djion BBQ sauce is one of a kind and I've never seen it replicated in any other restaurant. It's perfect for the crust  and chicken alike. I'll admit at times it's greasier than I like but overall it's one of my favorite pizzas in the city from the cheese to the sauce.
1	Just can't get decent pizza in Wisconsin... sorry... but someone needs to head down to Chicago and learn how to make a pizza.This place piles sauce and toppings on a crust that can't support it.  you end up with a slide off mess.  Flimsy crap.
1	Grease running down my hand. That's a first. Maybe that's appealing to some people, but definitely not me.Sorry, Pizza Pit staff. [Cue the Tim & Eric "Ya blew it!" .gif.]
3	The pizza here is OK, the staff here is friendly, and they have good daily deals.
