5	i knew i was in for a treat when the bread arrived, accompanied by an exceptional sun-dried tomato and olive butter. it was my last night in scotland, and i was  desperate to find a 4 or 5 star meal. a local yelper griped-- not without reason-- that i wasn't being fair in criticizing an entire city's cuisine because of a few less than stellar choices. he suggested a few places, several of them in leith. so i cabbed it down to the waterfront and what did i find? by far the best meal on this trip. finally!tucked away down by the water in a woody old nautical-themed building creaking with character, skippers has been serving up delectable seafood dishes for 30 years now. this piscine paradise features the freshest critters that the cold blue scottish  waters have to offer. for starters i ordered cullen skink, a smoked haddock chowder that tasted way better than the name sounds. accompanying this scrumptious soup were a dozen loch fyne oysters of outstanding quality. i selected king scallops with lemon and thyme risotto for my main course and again i was impressed. the scallops were smaller than i expected and much smaller than many i've had back home but they were delicious and the risotto was primo as well. i washed it all down with a lovely terre del noce pinot grigio and got out of there for just under 50 pounds, belying those who claim that this place is too expensive. as a matter of fact, they've even got a 2-course 30th birthday menu for under 20 pounds. i've been coming to the UK since 1995 and i can't remember the last time i had a meal this good here.
