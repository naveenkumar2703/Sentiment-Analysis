5	I have eaten at this restaurant several times and have never been disappointed.  The menu has been updated since the name changed from Gecko Grill, but the food is still excellent.  There isn't anyone there at lunch so you can get in and out in under a half-hour.  Delicious!!
4	Went there today with my girlfriends. Food was excellent. Will definitely go back and try something else.  Got the chicken lunch special and it was huge. Will have plenty of leftovers for tomorrows lunch. Staff very friendly.They even treated us to sopapillas before we left. Very Yummy!
4	Good food and great service.  Staff is very friendly and attentive without hovering.  I would definitely go back
5	This place has a great cozy feel, great service, and awesome food. The green chile burrito enchilada style will def. bring you back in! Wonderful experience!
4	I wouldnt say this place is like totally amazing. But they have great mexican food. AWESOME bean dip and cheap prices! We originally went because we had a groupon but my husband and I liked the food so much that we will be back!
1	This place is closed, has been for a while now, supposed to be opening back up next month as a greek restaurant, yet they are still offering the $10 for $20 deal, and it comes up as a special deal on Groupon too.  Something stinks here.  Methinks the owner is getting some cash for this deal, maybe to pay for his new restaurant?  If you don't believe me, call the number listed on the address, it even tell you this.
