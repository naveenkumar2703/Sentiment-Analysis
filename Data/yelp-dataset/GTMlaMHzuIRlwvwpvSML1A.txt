4	This appears to be a recently opened market next door to the Persian Room in Scottsdale.  I think that it is tied to the Persian Room.  This market has a lot of unique things from the Caspian Sea area (Iran and Russia).  You can get caviar here if you want.  You can also get traditional stone cooked Middle Eastern flatbread. This place is definitely worth looking at if you want anything Persian or from the Caspian Sea area of the world.
5	Great store!  They have stuff you don't see anywhere else.
5	Great selection and this market is only growing, but the deserts and bread will have me coming back often! Upon entry I was greeted by very friendly staff and they have anything and everything you could be looking for from a Middle Eastern grocer.I am a large fan of the roullette deserts and napoleon pasteies, they are so light and tasty, definitely a treat. If you are looking for the best examples of European or Perisan pastries you have to try these things! They are very elegant as well for special occasions. The bread here is fresh and you can see them cooking it right there in the market! Both sangak and lavash so great with everything, and there is nothing like fresh-made Persian bread!
5	Love that this place opened up near me, if your looking for middle eastern groceries this is a good spot...the fresh flat bread is a must at my house now!
