4	Not a bad gas station; The check out counter inside is always fast and store is clean and well light.To top things off they are always about a nickle cheaper on gas  than the station across the street.  I usually hit the other station but if I'm on this side of the street and need gas I'm happy to swing in here.
4	I've been to this location a few times.  I find the staff very friendly and on top of things!  Even the guy changing the trash was friendly!  The place is super clean and orderly, in in the morning at the coffee counter!  Gas prices are always cheaper if you pay cash and less expensive than the place across the street.
1	Have been here before. Went to get gas there last week. It was around 1030 at night.  They had someone there cleaning the floors, so I was not allowed in to buy gas. The employee was vey rude about it too. Their floors are not that clean! And why would you shut down the entire store instead of cleaning the floors in sections so that you can still operate? In response to the other reviews about the place being clean- you better go to the eye DR and get your vision checked.
1	horrible store young girl on swing shift with part dark and part blonde hair rolls her eyes at customers and very rude. shes lucky I had my kids with me because I felt like slapping the attitude right off her face not to mention she told her co worker she wanted to go and get high. what kinds of people does this store hire it wasn't very clean either, will not be going back there.
