5	Aside from the lovely scents (Grapefruit!  French Lime Blossom!), you simply must come in here to see what has to be the world's largest scented candle.  Seriously, the thing is the size of a bucket.  I actually can't use her lotions, I discovered they make me break into a rash, but the colognes are amazing and they'll give you a free sample to take with you if you ask nicely.
5	I'm so excited there is a Jo Malone shop in Las Vegas! I'd never been in to an actual store in the states (I went in one in London, since that's kind of the HQ for the brand). They have a new Vanilla Anise cologne that is to DIE for. Probably my new signature scent. I definitely purchased a bottle (the small size). The saleswoman was friendly & threw in a bunch of samples that I handed out to friends & family (and kept some of for myself, there were that many!) The colognes & products are a bit pricey, but they're very high quality and are worth the price. I can't wait to buy more of their stuff someday when I'm rich :).
5	I visited this store last year in June on a girl vacation.  The sales lady was sooooo sweet.  Only 2 out of 4 of us girls purchased some colognes but the sales lady gave everyone samples.  I bought the Nectarine Honey Blossom and White Jasmine.  We are now addicted!!!!
3	I get why another review said service was unpleasant.  The lady had a whiny, annoyed voice and didn't seem happy to see me.  However, once I started sampling perfume she became very helpful and even friendly, sharing her favorites and asking what I liked.  I didn't buy anything because I just spent all my yearly discretionary income at Saks on a Bond #9 sampler set, and the Jo Malone scents aren't really my thing, but the experience was actually ok.  Im not sure if you will run into this same lady, but if she seems annoyed just smile and spray and she will warm up to you.
