5	This is the place to go for any battery! They have saved my life and my phones! Thank you for the awesome service!!
3	Oh yea... checked out the flashlight that cost 260.00.  Um needs batteries. Not as bright as the sun. So I will not be purchasing it. Called to see if they had a certain battery the guy says yes come down Will be ready. So I picked it up and it was wrong one then I took it back. Got money back he tried to give me another one I said no it should have been right the first time. Well I am ok with it I guess. Can't expect every thing to be perfect. Over all these people are nice. Refund was easy. I must be tired right now because I am not bothered by this.
2	On the bright side, they had the motorcycle battery I needed in stock.  As for the rest - the battery was way overpriced, they offer a military discount but you have to be active duty - can't be retired, reserve, etc., and the battery that was supposed to come fully charged was not - had to get it charged before it would even start my bike.  Not a fan ...
