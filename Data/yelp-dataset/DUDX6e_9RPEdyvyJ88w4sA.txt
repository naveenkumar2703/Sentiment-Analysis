3	Driving down Rainbow all the time and we always pass by Nagoya 2.  But leave it to an advertisement selling their newest addition to the menu "AYCE Korean BBQ" to have us coming through their doors.Once you get passed the boring facade, you walk into a large restaurant establishment with a bar to the right, sushi bar in the middle, tables to the left, and bbq tables on the further leftThe Husband wanted AYCE Korean BBQ, and there's only one way he can get it - if I order it with him.  (It's offered to parties of two or more doing AYCE only.)Adult prices: $19.95Kid prices: 8 years old and younger: $12.95A little banchan starts your Korean meal - Korean pancake, broccoli, pickled cucumbers, and potato. Not much here.As the waitress was getting our table set up, I asked her if I'm supposed to go ahead and tell her what I want.  She mentioned something about them usually bringing everything out, unless I have a preference.  We definitely did have a preference because we didn't quite want it all!There are about seven different appetizers to choose from, we went with:* Garlic Edamame "Soy bean with spicy garlic sauce)* Gyoza (Deep fried dumpling)* Chicken Wing (Spicy marinated)The kitchen list has about six items, and we got:* Tonkatsu (Deep fried breaded pork)* Vegetable Tempura (Assorted vegetable deep fried)* Kake Udon (Thick noodles soup with fried tofu, fish cake, seaweed)* Fried Rice (Vegetable)From the Korean BBQ list of four items:* Galbi (Angus marinated BBQ beef ribs)* Samgyubsal (Pork belly)(Our waitress did all the cooking for us here, so that was nice.)From the Classic Rolls list of seven items:* Salmon Skin Roll (grilled salmon skin)* Spicy Tuna Roll (spicy tuna, cucumber)For dessert, you get only one scoop of vanilla or green tea ice cream.The staff really didn't want our fellow diners to not do AYCE with us, but we told them otherwise.  The MIL and her companion chose to order off their regular Japanese menu.  They both had the Combination Dinner Special which includes salad, rice, miso soup, gyoza, and two items from their list for $13.50.  (It's $15.50 if you want three items.)  She went for the tonkatsu and miso saba, while he went for the shrimp tempura and calamari tempura.  However, we think he got the short end of the stick because there were only two pieces of shrimp and the rest were veggies.  (In retrospect, he would have done the Shrimp Tempura Entree dinner for $12.90 and gotten 6 pieces of shrimp instead.)  What a bummer!  They also got what looked like a half order of a CA roll with their meal.Service was good for the latter part.  Our initial waitress was a bit spacey, until we moved into the bbq section and then that waitress was better and a lot more friendlier.  It was only a Tuesday night, but they had a steady stream of customers - some sitting at the tables, another sitting at the AYCE bbq section, and more sitting at the sushi bar.  They have a pretty extensive menu, and the sushi menu is pretty long.Overall, it wasn't bad for AYCE.  Sure, we've had a better selection for a fraction of the price, but it'll have to do for the southwest area for now.  But for more bang for your buck, you're better off over on Spring Mountain.
4	This place is just down the street from my house, and I really like it.Their garlic edamame is the best, we order it everytime we go!The chicken yakisoba is great, and the sushi is really good too. They don't have all you can eat (as far as I know, at least I've never got it), but their prices are abour average. The servers have always been nothing but great.Love this place!
4	The food here can be hit or miss. But when they're on, they're really good. The yellowtail in garlic sauce is mighty tasty. The list of specialty rolls is extensive and I haven't been disappointed by many. Most of my complaints stem from the quality of the product. When their fish is fresh, it tastes great. When it isn't, it tastes like the kind of sushi you would buy from a grocery store. 3.5 stars.
4	I like this restaurant.The servers were very attentive and my water glass never went empty.  The food came quickly and my yakisoba was sizzling on a small cast iron plate.  The food was "average" price.  My yakisoba was $12 but I would have liked to have paid $10.  I do however like the sesame seeds that were sprinkled on top.  It really made a difference and I love me some sesame seeds.The restaurant was very clean and well staffed.  I think they had areas for hibachi which makes me want to go back even more.  I'll dream about it until next time.
4	We found out about this location through the owners. We were regulars at their first location and they had mentioned that they were opening up this location so we decided to go check it out the first week that they opened. Decor is real modern. They have a Sushi Bar, Bar area, Regular seating area and they also have Korean BBQ tables, the ones with the grill in the center of your table. We've only had sushi at this location and I like the quality of their food, it's the same attention to detail as Nagoya-1.The only reason why I knocked off one star is because of their prices. We'd probably visit if the prices weren't as expensive as they are.
5	I found out about this location through a flyer I received at my house (I live down the street) I almost didn't go as the flyer didn't have any prices listed for the specific items they were advertising, which made me mistakenly believe they were going to be way too expensive.On a whim, I had my son run in and get a menu while we were driving by. Hmmm...prices not bad.That was a few months ago....Since then it has become a favorite place to go "out" for my family.We always get the AYCE Korean BBQ.The list of everything they automatically bring to your table is extensive, but to top it off there's a healthy list of "extras" you can order at no additional charge.The food quality is excellent...fresh, hot, flavorful. Lately I've been finding a lot of the restaurants' food choices all taste the same...like they've all been cooked in the same pot with the same spices and sauces. Not here. Everything has it's own distinct, mouthwatering flavor.The only problem I or anyone I have ever taken to this restaurant have had is how to stop eating :) There are so many great dishes, it makes it almost impossible to decide what you want more of, or what to save room for. VERY accomodating and family friendly...I've shown up with a party of 10 with 4 of the 10 being children...No problem! (They even have special chopsticks for the little ones)
1	The service was horible and so was the food. I'll never go back to this place. Plain sucks and the are very cheap about the food. I was told I can have anythin on the menu and then told that I can on have 2 peices of mussels
5	We frequent here often since it's near our house. Great service and really good rolls. When we are not in the mood for all you can eat at oyishi down the road, we come here for great quality rolls. The sushi chefs are very friendly.
4	My friends recommended this place since they only live down the street and how can you beat all you can eat Korean BBQ for 20 bucks!! What a steal! Came on a Friday afternoon around noon. This place was DEAD! However the decor is amazing! Really looks like a modern lounge more than a resturant! We got seated in the korean bbq area. I like how it is seperate from the dinner lounge ( because of the vents and smell lol).  They have a pre fixed menu that they give you. Noted on the menu in red. Salad (salad dressing was wierd), miso soup, goyza, chicken wings (more like sesame chicken..BOMB!!). fried rice (had to order two plates! The best fried rice, it wasn't sticky and had a ton of flavor!), All you can eat meats we got were bulgogi nad kalbi. The bulgogi was very good had a alot of flavor however the kalbi I have had better. They also have marinated chicken and pork belly.You can also order other things off the menu such as sushi and other appetizers but you get so much out of the pre fixed menu that ordering other things seemed impossible to eat!! The only thing we ordered was the salmon skin roll. The salmon was so crunchy and salty that it tasted like chips! For dessert we got a choice from vanilla or green tea ice cream.The service was great. The server cooked our bbq and she was very generous on giving more portions to the guys LOL. If I lived in Vegas I would def come back here on a monthly basis! LOL :)
1	Was so excited to find a AYCE korean bbq, only to be really disappointed all around.  I'm from Los Angeles and was hoping the korean bbq would be similiar to those from L.A.   I was wrong.  First, we went on a holiday weekend (saturday night), and the place was empty.  A waitress led us to a table where we can cook our own meat.   She explained that "red" items on the menu will be brought out automatically, but the "black" items on the menu would have to be ordered.  We asked for the garlic endamame and spicy tuna roll.  I will admit that that spicy tuna roll had a lot less rice than other AYCE sushi places - but that's because we weren't having AYCE sushi, but AYCE korean bbq.  /shrugThe waitress checked on us frequently, but everything about her was fake and it was obvious she was just going through the motions and didn't care at all.  To prove this point, our waitress took orders for 3 different types of meat (bulgogi, kalbi and cow's tongue).  She brought out the bulgogi first and while others have wrote that the staff cooked the meat for them, we had to cook our own.  She would come by from time to time and toss the meats around, but left the cooking to us.  After bulgogi and kalbi, our grill was completely crusted from the marinations from the meat.  At this time, the waitress forgot that she didn't bring out the other meat and brought it out only to dump it on top of the crusted grill - note:  cow's tongue is unmarinated and she completely ruined the flavor of it.   We didn't have a chance to ask for more meat cuz all she wanted to do was turn off the grill and be done with us.  We were the only patrons - you'd think they would try to please their only customer rather than shooing them out the door.Overall, I would never go back.  While $20 for AYCE sounds reasonable, it seemed too much for the quality and quantify of this place.  Service made it even worse.
5	Went to Nagoya last night for one of my closest friends' 22nd Birthday dinner and man I was impressed.  Located across from the Lodge on Rainbow and Windmill is a hidden hot spot for sushi & Korean BBQ.  The restaurant has a full sushi bar, bar, dinning area, and private BBQ rooms.Went on a Tuesday night and the place was pretty slow, however, one of our friends has eaten there before and the sushi chef just kept making roll after roll after platter haha.  By the time all was said and done our group of about twenty people hand all the sushi we could handle.  The all-you-can eat pricing is reasonable and the sushi is fantastic, add a great location that is easy to drive to and a friendly staff and you have my vote everyday!
5	My co- worker and I stumbled across Nagoya by accident and I'm glad we did! I was a little skeptical about eating there because I didn't want to eat all sushi but I was glad there was also hot items on the all you can eat menu. We had Chicken Katsu which was nice and crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. The Kalbi I ate there was the best I've tasted. It was actually juicy and it wasn't cut too thin. The Jeffery Roll (I think that's the name of it) had mango, cream cheese , crab , and it was crispy on the outside. It was really good because I like imaginative rolls.The Jeffery Roll is now my new favorite roll. The Black Jack rolls were also delicious. It had spicy crab meat, and avocado in it . The California Rolls were topped with spicy crab meat  too. If you can't tell by now I love spicy crab meat! The only thing that I wouldn't order again is their Shrimp Balls because I thought it was going to be crunchy but it was kind of soggy. We ended the meal with Green Tea Ice cream. It was a great deal because everything was fresh but you only get an hour to order what you want on the all you can eat menu. They usually start off with two items at a time per person.. It's a good idea for those who have eyes bigger than their stomach. It's also a money saver because if they think you are wasting you have to pay extra. This place has great decor and clean bathrooms which is always a plus.
5	Handing out five-stars like they were going out of style..... I know that the rating is reserved for the top-notch spots in town, and guess what; Nagoya is one of them.  Went last week for a friends' b-day dinner and returned with my family for my personal b-day dinner.Nagoya delivers the perfect level of freshness, price, and service at their restaurant.  They offer a full bar, inspiring and thoughtful sushi rolls, and a great atmosphere.  They even take the restaurant a step further  than your normal "sushi place" and have hawaiian menu items and Japanese BBQ rooms...... Simply top-notch, five star!
4	very yummy!  love the sushi!a must try is the garlic edamame.the atmosphere is half sports bar/ half traditional and they even offer grills.  grilling is always an experience.. but be prepared to smell like food when you walk out.  the menu is stacked and has a lot to offer.   i always get a rainbow roll, salmon, and tuna... and the fish is always fresh!  i love the salmon teriyaki as well! it's pretty pricey joint.  I've only been here for the sushi, buy am definitely coming back to try the all you can eat korean bbq!
4	Found this place by accident.. delicious sushi in a city that has a different sushi bar inside every strip mall... I will not eat at any other sushi place i love the "screaming orgasm" and their "steak roll" ... all the staff greet you and bid you farewell.... awesome place
3	I would have given this place 5-stars but ever since they switched to AYCE...the quality has gone down. I used to love having their Tonkatsu Roll with calamari in the middle instead of shrimp but now they don't have it. The menu has cut down A LOT and it's very disappointing cause I was a loyal customer. I preferred this place over Oyshi Sushi but now it seems Oyshi has overtaken it.
3	My husband & I frequent this place often.The staff are so friendly , and decor is warm and relaxing. The sushi is always yummy and fresh! Highly recommended.
4	My friends used to go to the location on Fort Apache all the time and I would tag along occasionally.  My friends developed some sort of odd relationship with the staff.  Whenever the staff would see them coming from the parking lot, they would hold the door shut so my friends couldn't get in.  Yeah, strange, I know.  But my friends like to mess with people so I guess the staff caught on and reciprocated.  They would let them in eventually.Anyhow, the owners opened a new location on Rainbow and my friends started going to this location because it's closer to their home.  One of them wanted to do the AYCE Korean BBQ for his birthday, so there we are.  With a large group of people, it is super fun.  Everything on the AYCE Korean BBQ menu in red, you get automatically.  Everything in black you have to order.  The whole table must participate.  You can get some sushi rolls, noodles, baked mussels, garlic edamame (yum!) etc. so it's fairly unique and there is something to please everyone.  Except for ice cream and baked mussels, everything on the list is AYCE.  And it's only $20 per person.  They've got those "order accordingly" signs all over the place threatening to charge you for food you don't eat.  But they aren't nazis about it. But the signs did make some of our guests feel a little uncomfortable. ("If I don't eat every last bit of the fried rice, will they charge us for it?" No, they won't.)  The signs are a little tacky, but most AYCE sushi places do this so c'est la vie.Everything tasted very good to me.  The only thing I miss is all the little sides you get with normal Korean BBQ places (e.g. pickles, kimchi, random potato salad, etc.).  Unless I'm with a large group, I think I might stick with Maru for my Korean BBQ fix, which is more traditional and close to home.  And I've got my regular sushi place (Sushi Fever) so it won't replace that either.The owner was super nice and gave us free sake bombs to celebrate!  It was a great time and I really recommend it for large groups.
1	I am a sushi lover and have been to many sushi places around town.  This place is just right around our neighborhood we ought to try....Since we( my wife and I) were sushi hungry.  We decided to go for the all you can eat for 23.95 which included many varieties of sushi, rolls and appetizers.  Don't do it!!  It is a ripoff.  They want to filled you up fast so that you can't eat anything else.   To be a little over exaggerating, the rice is as big as my fist, the sushi on top was as thin as paper.  The rolls were extremely big - the rice that is.  The fish weren't too fresh either.  Sea Urchin was on the menu limited to one order per customer - well, they were out.   Hamachi Kama, that too were out!!  The service was horrible.  It would take a SOS flare to get their attention.  That was my first time and 100% sure it would be my last.  Overall, totally disappointed.
3	Went for sushi and had a mixed experience.  The freshness of the fish was fine, but the quality of the sushi chef was lacking.  Basic things like cutting the rolls so that the pieces are at least close to the same size and packing the rice so that it doesn't fall apart should be a given.  I enjoyed the taste of most of their rolls, but have some attention to detail.
2	I have three important statements:1) Too much rice in their sushi2) Too much sodium in their side dishes3) Too much batter on everything tempuraI was fairly disappointed in this place as it was my first time tonight and I was craving sushi.  So I decided to try the AYCE which is actually a pretty good deal compared to other places in Vegas.  1 star definitely for the garlic edamame2 stars for the quick turnaround on food orders and the fact that they offer half ordersWe ordered Gyoza and it was overcooked and salty.  The sushi we ordered was fresh, but the sushi to rice ratio was not fair.  My friend and I were way too full to fast and believe you me, we can eat.  The tempura shrimp tasted like straight up batter with no shrimp inside.  The tempura ice cream was the same way; not enough ice cream for such a bready shell.  It should have had more crunch to it.  I forget which roll we ordered, but it was good minus the rice ratio.  The hamachi and sake sushi was fresh; but the rice again was too much.I will try this place one more time just to check out some more of their wide selection; but for now, I can only offer 2 stars for this place because of the dissatisfaction to my crave.
2	I came here with some friends for my birthday dinner.  The restaurant is fairly large and was able to accommodate my large party. However, my approval of this restaurant ends there.Sushi quality: The cuts of fish that were served to our table were poor.  One piece of nigiri looked like they took scrap pieces of fish and threw it on some rice.  You are not supposed to see the rice of the nigiri through the holes in the fish. More importantly, there shouldn't be holes in the fish!!Additionally, the fish scraps provided on the nigiri were dwarfed by the mountain of rice upon which they sat.  I'm not sure what others mean when they say that Oyshi provides a lot of rice to fill you up and that Nagoya does not.  If anything, assuming such a claim about Oyshi is true because I would disagree, Oyshi borrowed that practice from Nagoya's playbook.  A little fish with your rice? Yes please...Service: VERY SLOW.  My group placed its order and we waited... and waited.. and waited. Finally, food started coming out.  People were getting their nigiri and some rolls. Fine.  However, it seemed as if the people in my group that were ordering a la carte menu rather than the AYCE were getting food much faster than the AYCE participants. (Possibly a tactic to fill you up? I can only speculate.)  One person finally received a few pieces of the sushi that she ordered when we sat about 30 minutes after most others had received things on their second round of ordering.  We thought that they lost her order.I received a roll ONE HOUR after it was ordered.  The place was pretty busy but ONE HOUR for a sushi roll is ridiculous.  It wasn't even a roll that was deep-fried.  If you can't handle the size of the restaurant and the demand from those customers, hire more staff or close a section. Lastly, when we were seated those in my group that were not ordering AYCE asked the waitress for a regular menu.  She stated that they didn't have a regular menu and that all they had were the AYCE menus.  This seemed strange and it was slightly upsetting to see another couple sitting across the way with regular menus.  Seems odd to lie about something like that...  I don't think I'll be coming back here any time soon, if ever...
4	There are a ton of sushi restaurants to pick from in this city and of those there are a bunch of all-you-can-eat joints, most of them are crap. This is one of the best in the bunch but better yet this place has atmosphere and energy. And even more than that the fish is fresh and the food is delish. Honestly, I go there when Christine is working, she's like my personal sushi chef. She knows exactly how I like my screaming o (the food version, don't get it twisted), that I love halibut and I to drink Asashi and soju shots. The wait staff is attentive and my glass is always chilled. That's customer service that keeps me coming back. Kanpai!
4	I have eaten at both Nagoya's and frequent both.  This location has much nicer decor and is huge!  But it is always empty, which makes me sad. I hate empty places.I fell in love with their garlic edamame from reviews on here, and am so thankful for it! However, I am constantly craving it when it isn't sushi night.I am not a sushi snob and eat the americanized rolls and stay away from the 'scary' items. So I may not be the best person to rate sushi!  But Nagoya does my type of rolls well. Their tempura is always fresh (unlike Oyshi which pre cooks their shrimp tempura and lets them sit out until used) and sweet, the way I like it.  Their spicy tuna is spicy without being overbearing. I don't feel like they use too much rice in the rolled pieces, but perhaps in the Nigiri they do. One thing that I don't like is that some of their rolls are ---- long and others are -------------- long.  So you expect your next roll to be one size, and next thing you know, you have a monster roll in front of you.  They do offer half rolls, which I need to learn to take advantage of.My boyfriend loves their Mango spicy tuna roll, which very few places offer. We failed AYCE sushi last night and barely ate our worth as we filled up so fast, but normally we make full advantage of it there!
1	To put this simply, I downloaded yelp on my phone just to voice my experience. Not only was every item I tasted terrible and sloppy, way to much rice on sushi and breading on tempura, and in a completely empty restaurant they wouldn't put just salmon on my rainbow/California roll because that's not the way they do it. And as usual I had to endure my server eating while taking care of me. And she let out a loud sigh as she walked away because I didn't eat what she brought me because it was not what I asked for. Do urself a favor n save ur money there r too many choices in Vegas (e.g. oyshi) to deal with all of that.
4	Overall, food was really good. I didn't do the buffet. You have a choice if you want to eat ala carte or buffet. I had the Crazy Jalapeno & the X Mas. Prices were reasonable. Customer service was for the most part, okay. The place is very clean. Would i come back? Yes i would because of the food.
1	This place was one bad experience after another.  The exterior looks like a neighborhood pub that has been bought by a new owner.  It is very uninviting with no windows and one ominous door as the front enterance.  Once inside, it is modern with a clean estetic.  You immediately walk into the sushi bar, but all table seating is partitioned off by room dividers.  When we went, 6 pm on a Sunday evening, I think there was only one other table seated.  Over the course of our meal, only two other tables were seated. You would think that with as many servers as there are diners that it would be great service, well I tell you not the case.  First order of business was drinks.  I was not presented a drink list and had to ask for the list of sake.  I want to say that there were four choices for cold sake in each in varying sizes.  I ultimately decided on the flight as I felt the small bottles (starting at $17 for 300 mL) were over priced.  We ordered all you can eat sushi.  It included the entire menu.  We first ordered some Hamachi Kama, to which the waiter asked, "is that on the menu? can you show me where?".  He then went to check with the chef if they could make it for the all you can eat, which they later told us they were "out of".  We asked for no wasabi on the tuna sushi so that our daughter could enjoy it as well.  All of the nigiri came without wasabi, nor did we have wasabi or ginger on a side dish for dipping either.  Again, for an empty restaraunt, it was disappointing to have to ask for a plate or something as common as wasabi and ginger.  The sushi itself was not cut very well and the rice was horrible.  The rice was not cooked evently, nor was it seasoned for sushi. Next item to arrive was some Chilled soba noodles, the highlight of the night.  It was very tasty and just the right amount for the three of us to share.  We tried to order a natto (but was told they do not have it).  By this time I had finished my flight of sake and ordered a 300 mL bottle.  To which I was told they do not have it.  They had a larger size at $65 per bottle, but i was not interested in paying that much for it.  I was even told that if I did not finish the larger bottle, I would not be allowed to take it with me.  My choice of Sake was served as part of the tasting flight, so I found it really irritating that they were unable to come up with a solution to sell me some sake.  It was if we were a huge inconvinence to them.Much of the other items ordered were just so so, and the service was very poor at times too.  When I ordered half rolls, I would receive 10 pieces.  The Sushi Orgasm, was good, but if I was ordering it a la carte, I would not pay $14 for that plate of 5 small slices of tuna with some mayo on it.
1	**Summary**       - Tempura batter - I could hardly find my shrimp in my tempura       - Rice - Their portions of rice are insane. The fish are sliced so thin that a couple were literally see through. They even had rice in their dynamite. Who does that?       - Freshness - Average.       - Portions - The slivers of fish that were given on both rolls and nigiri made me question if they  believed fish had gone extinct. I was able to see the rice beneath the half sliver of Uni I got.       - Advertised - They did not have hamachi kama as promised and did not honor their half roll policy.       - Decor - I must give it to them however, the ambiance inside gave a very modern and hip feel.**Price**       - $23.95 for dinner(3pm-11pm) AYCE Sushi**Ordered**       - Uni (Sea Urchin) - Mediocre quality UNI on an over filling bed of rice.       - Saba (Mackerel) - Good quality piece. It tried it's best to cover the rice beneath it.       - Popcorn Lobster Roll - A very good roll. I've never seen another place offer this. One of the only things I enjoyed here.       - Red & Red Roll - Tuna one spicy tuna. The ponzu sauce was good.       - Aged Tofu - Tasteless       - Screaming Orgasm - I believe that the seared ahi tuna slices were indeed anorexic and malnourished.       - Oysters - Not bad. Partially frozen in the middle though.       - Chicken Wing (garlic) - Dryest and worst chicken wing I've ever had.       - Shrimp Tempura - 4-1 tempura batter to shrimp ratio.       - Croquette - Ordinary but not bad.       - Tempura Ice Cream & Green Tea Mochi - Out of a box generic taste.**Recommendations**       - I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you have a passion for rice and disliked thick pieces of fish.
1	rice galore!
3	So big night out.. roomie and I decided to have sushi...  I love Nagoya.. they always have the best sushi .. and their blackjack roll is like heaven wrapped in rice.But honestly I may have a new favorite and it is the popcorn lobster... This is a dish that will be one of my regulars. Of course there was the all time go-to which is a California roll. Shrimp tempura rocked!  Spicy Shrimp roll had great texture and the flavor was unbelievable.mmmm I am getting hungry all over again.Honestly I believe this place to be 5 star food. But what ruined this night out was my waitress.  She didn't really pay attention to our order... even though she wrote it down. I am glad I wasn't super thirsty because refills were NON existent.  Then she never came back. 25 minutes we sat... waiting ... for a refill.. more sushi.. maybe dessert? But no... waitress.. not anywhere .. Finally Tonya another waitress looked over and asked if the waitress had been back .. .I said no and that we had been waiting for a very long time. She immediately bowed and apologized... She brought us our check which only had our drinks on it... Which if we were not completely awesome people with integrity ... we could have taken advantage of it. But we quickly brought this to Tonya's attention, her eyes widened with how honest we had been and she thanked us. Then brought us a corrected bill.  Which we paid . We also gave a tip .. and told Tonya that it should be for her because she was working her butt off. I would like to have more of a sense of humor about the waitress situation and I think that if I go back - I will ask to sit in Tonya's section ... But even with good food... it sucked to be ignored.
2	I really wanted to give this place a higher rating. We went at 2:30 or so and the place was completely empty. Not one other table was seated. We sat at the bar and ordered AYCE. Considering we were the only people there you would think the sushi chef would be happy to serve us. Nope! The entire time we were having to yell for his attention to get him to make us some food. On top of that he was taking forever and acting like he was way too busy for us. Hello dude we are the only ones in here stop being so slow! I like to order a roll and when I receive it order the next roll I want to come so there's no waiting in between dishes. This guy refused to make the next roll until we were completely done AND the server had cleared our plates... 2 stars for great tasting fish
1	Slow service..more rice than sushi
2	Friday night at 8:00 and the place was empty and i am pretty sure i know why.The selections are normal for an AYCE sushi place. The rice was not sticking to most of the rolls and i was worried they would think i was not trying to eat it.The "Lasagna" was the worst!!! There was around an inch of cream cheese on top and just dominated any other flavor. The cut of the roll was so big i couldn't fit it into my mouth and by trying to cut it with chop stix turned it into a complete pile of mush.THere were a few descent rolls but not worth going back.
3	I've eaten here twice, once for AYCE, once for a few rolls and some sake.  Both experiences were OK.They have some inventive items - such as the Superman Burrito roll - and they taste pretty good.  It isn't the freshest or the best sushi in the world but it's solid and it does the trick.Their sake is OK, too.  I have a preference for some of the higher end stuff simply because it goes down smoother, but theirs was pretty good.
4	Great night out with friends for Sushi and we ended up at Nagoya.  We had a great time, the staff was very nice and the sushi was great!  Just as good as the crowded place down the street, if not better!  We will def go back.
1	Setting: nice dim lighting and pretty decorations.AYCE menu: food was ok. I ordered uni and hamachi kama but they were "sold out"...which I don't see how since their restaurant was empty.Service: They lost our order list and found it sometime later so we got a huge pause in between our dishes. They even messed up our dessert orders for vanilla when we ordered green tea tempura ice cream. None of them really smile at you. An overall bad first time experience. I don't think we'll be coming back.
4	First time here today, and definitely not too bad. It's not the best place I've been to, but I'll admit, I got my fill and was able to kick my sushi craving. I would definitely like to come back, especially since it's a little bit different from selections I've had in other restaurants.The only thing I found confusing was that, reading the menu made me believe that appetizers and other categories were all under the "All You Can Eat" menu. I mean, I guess it couldn't hurt to redo and organize the menu a little, but no big deal, I guess; we still got what we wanted, and it's just a little detail that can be easily over-looked.The guy taking our order and helping us for most of the night was very friendly, and was very immediate to our needs. Not so much with the lady who took over for him, I guess, as she was very pushy; it was like she was getting us out of the door while we were still finishing up our food. Also, it seemed that while the nice guy checked up on us every ten to fifteen minutes, it took such a long time to get the check from the lady.The sushi was very delicious, however, despite a few flaws, as I suspect it's not as nice and fresh as it can be, but it wasn't bad. The flavors are enticing for the most part, and I genuinely enjoyed the taste. The combination fried rice was where it was at for me, and my favorite roll out of all that we ordered was the Crunch #2 with calamari. I hope to try out things outside of rolls whenever I return to Nagoya, though.But, overall, a pretty good night for me. I may have seen and had better, but it was still nice, for a bit of a change, and I want to try some of the 'weird, new' rolls that I'd definitely never seen in other restaraunts.
1	The service was really bad here! Our waitress was rude and such in a rush? Really strange the restaurant was empty only one other couple sitting at the bar. I was doing the ayce, as I was ordering the waitress walked away and I wasn't even done ordering???? I would never come back here again.. It's sad really nice place but so clueless!
1	I say pass on this AYCE sushi joint. Sushi was ok. But everything started to taste the same. I guess they like using the sweet sauce in all their "special" rolls.  Once in a lifetime visit for me. Never again. Their service was really sucky. Waitresses were very rude. Customer service is not their thing. People pass on this place. Kbye.
1	If you like bad service and just OK sushi, then come here. If you don't take my word for it, the empty seats when you walk in "should" be the tall tale sign not to come here.We came to this place because all other all-you-can eat sushi joints in the area were  at least 1-2 hour wait(new years weekend). This place had NO wait (I wonder why?).Each time we ordered something (remember all you can eat) the waitress would ask, "are you sure??". They also had that disgusted look when we ordered. We did not feel welcome at all.Trust me on this review...FYI: the food was ok...nothing special. To be honest, all the rolls tastes exactly the same.
1	There are so many clues here, where do I begin? Well, uh first off I don't do AYCE sushi because of this very reason, IT'S NEVER FRESH! Korean marinated sushi is what it is. Secondly, the name says it's all, when it called a "Japanese and Korean BBQ restaurant", an third, like the others yelpers said, the place was dead. All of these signs, yet I still decided to let my friend talk me into eating with her here. Literally 4 other people when we came here at 8:00pm, we were sat at the bar and presented the AYCE menu, which always baffles me, let's see how many rolls we can change the name of and trick the white person. My first roll was not good, so I gave them a second chance and ordered something else, which of course tastes the same but the salmon on top looked old and dry. By this time I had lost my appetite, it is then you make the decision to waste $30 on dinner and call it a loss or chance getting sick on sub par, not sushi grade fish.  I called it a loss. The waitress that came to refill my tea kept sniffling, and then I saw here wipe her nose with her hand and then go in the back, come out and do the same, I know she didn't wash her hands. Then proceed to lean over me and do the same. At this point I'm pissed because this is not only common sense, but clearly rude and not hygienic. No way would I return or recommend this dump.
4	Great sushi place.  Nice and quiet.  Great rolls, always have had great service here.  Attentive and on the spot with refills, and sushi chefs at the bar always ready to take your sushi orders.
2	I decided to go to Nagoya 1. because it's close to my house and 2. because the other Nagoya on Fort Apache has always been a great sushi experience. My food was alright, but didn't have that umm "fresh" taste. I am all for trying new places and this wasn't horrible, but I've definitely had better. One thing that was okay is their all you can eat was like $24 and I ordered 3 different rolls which would've been more than $30 if I ordered them by themselves. Maybe if I was just going to grab a quick bite I may go again, but I think I'll stick with my usual sushi spots from now on.
2	I walked in here a couple of afternoons ago and this place was a ghost town! There was a family in the dining room and one other guy at the bar. This place is close to home so I wanted to try it out. The nigiri was fresh but it just didn't taste as good as I'm used to at Goyemon. The rolls were good and I loved the added options for side dishes. I actually ordered the chilled soba noodles and I don't see that at very many AYCE places.The server was attentive but ordering from the sushi chef was hell. He screwed up my first two orders. I got spicy tuna roll first out when I actually just ordered tuna nigiri along with my other nigiri orders. I would have complained but he lucked out and spicy tuna is usually my second order anyway. I won't go back here. Goyemon has my heart!
2	This place offers an extensive AYCE menu including oysters and korean fare. The service was pretty slow and a bit unattentive considering that the place was not busy. Then the experience pretty much went downhill. The rolls that arrived were unimaginative and the fish quality was way below par compared to what other local sushi bars serve. Not to mention the tempura was also underdone. Giving this place a big fat MEH.
1	We showed up around 7:30  this evening, expecting a nice crowd. The entire restaurant was empty. There was only a couple sitting at the sushi bar. THAT was the 1st sign of concern. We ordered a few spicy hand rolls to start, they were good. But when we started ordering off of their all you can eat menu the waiter said (more than once) that "You have to eat it all or we charge you". Great thanks. We only ordered a few rolls for two people, so to repeat this comment was really unnecessary. The menu said that they offer half rolls, which is fantastic. We asked if we can have that for every roll we ordered and he agreed. Then--every roll he brought out was a full order. He wasn't paying attention to anything we said at all. Another waitress/busgirl came over about 5 times asking if we were OK. It was overkill. Everything about this place just turned me off. The staff seemed bored because of the lack of business. The last roll was called "lasagne on fire" or something like that. It was terrible. It tasted like a bad tuna salad wrapped in old rice and smothered in a thick mayo and spicy sauce. I tasted one piece and we left the rest. Worst roll ever...I came home and puked my guts up (Sorry for the visual), the mayo taste was like lingering death. As if it wasn't bad enough, at the end this busgirl gave us a tutorial explanation of how their "rules" work there as far as ordering etc. The food was bad, the only thing I liked was the hand roll. We will NOT return. Their ambiance wasn't impressive. And the restaurant seems to be empty often (I read this on several reviews before posting this) AND the food made me sick! Good luck and God Speed to whoever decides to eat there!
3	Not a bad sushi joint. The place was nicely decorated and the all you can eat sushi price was pretty reasonable. I wasn't a fan of their spider roll though. The sweet sauce ruined it for me :( oh well...
3	I wouldn't say this place is as bad as a lot of the reviews on here say, but I wasn't terribly impressed.As a non-fish eater, I appreciated that they have Steak and Chicken rolls on the menu instead of veggie or tofu only. I ordered the Steak roll, which the waitress said was five pieces, but received 8 instead. That wasn't the first of the miscommunications. We went in at 6:00 and were the only table in the restaurant, until another group of four showed up. We ordered, then about five minutes later they ordered; the same waitress delivered our food to their table. She had a 50/50 shot and she missed... hope she doesn't take that luck to the tables.My friends ordered the all-you-can-eat dinner for about $26, which considering the price of rolls, is a great deal. I ordered one roll (steak) and the dinner box, which cost as much as their all-you-can-eat. The chicken was really fatty but the teriyaki sauce and the katsu breading were really good. Also, and this may be standard for Japanese restaurants and I just don't know it, but the waitress told us we could only order one Mochi dessert per person. We were totally willing to pay for more, but she was firm that it was one per person. Okay, you just missed out on additional revenue... whatever.
4	I frequent this restaurant quite a bit because it's right behind my house and I love sushi. As far as sushi places go, it's not the absolute best  I've ever had in my whole life or anything, however it's still extremely good and the service is also really good 90% of the time unless they're particularly busy.Their fish is always top grade, and the tuna is especially good. The only thing that's ever really been off is the rice. Sometimes the rice has a weird consistency like it's been sitting around for awhile, but very rarely do I get sushi rolls with bad rice. Most of the time it's excellent.There are of course some rolls I prefer over others but this is more of a taste preference as opposed to something being "bad".Their beef udon is also extremely delicious, especially with a few sprinkles of fish seasoning or chili powder.The service is very friendly and the staff recognizes me now after going there so often so they're particularly pleasant towards me, and they can often accurately guess what I want before I order, which I appreciate.The atmosphere is pretty nice too, it's got sort of  modern "club" feel to it. Everything is kind of dark and dimly lit and they have paper lanterns hanging around the sushi bar to tie in the Japanese theme. The only thing I don't like is they usually play really annoying club music but again, that's just a personal preference.All in all, I really enjoy this place and will continue to go often.
1	I have loved this place for years, but tonight they lost me as a customer. We had a party of 5 for like an hour and a half, then a friend joined at the end for 15 minutes, while we ate dessert. So we were automatically charged for a large group gratuity. This is ridiculous! Rip off!
1	One star-- should be half a star! yah this place sucks big time! totally! imnever coming back here! Imagine servers shouting at each other.. Food sucks!!! They even gave me the bill while were still eating.. how nice! Goodluck on who ever eats here..
