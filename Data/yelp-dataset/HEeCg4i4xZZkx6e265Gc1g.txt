5	A good reason to drive to Coolidge Arizona. Wonderful local family owned restaurant. These folks know how to cook.  Highly recommended. Thanks Ted
3	Food was good but not great. Could use a lunch menu with smaller portions. I had Carne Asada tacos that had a wonderful flavor and texture, but the tacos had only one layer of corn tortilla for the wrap and by the second bite of the first taco I had to eat the remaining meat with a fork. Maybe a second tortilla to hold my taco together. Over $20 for two entrees with no beverages at lunch time.
4	The tamales, and the cheese crisp here are awesome! And after seeing the photo of the Mexican pizza, that will be what I dig into on my next visit YUM!!
5	We traveled  to Coolidge from Chicago via Phoenix  to meet my brother and his family from Tucson and visit the Casa Grande Ruins.  We were fortunate to have lunch at the Sunset Cafe which made the trip.  The food was very good, the portions perfectly sized and the service and hospitality remarkable.  A visit to this family run cafe alone is worth the 1 1/4 hour trip from Tucson and Phoenix.  The calabasita enchiladas plate and mexican cheesecake dessert were delicious.
5	To make a truly great restaurant you need great family recipes, food with big bold taste and items that you can find no were else.  The Sunset Cafe has all that plus much more.  The interior is beautiful and well thought out. The staff will make you feel comfortable and pampered.  You must try the grilled shrimp. The one pound tamales are a real show stopper.  Easy to find and lots of parking. I am going back.
1	Restaurant  Closed.. No food No Service, No Employees. Second time here in past two weeks. Finally went to Tags and had lunch. I asked the waitress how long the Sunset Cafe has been closed, & she said for two months.
