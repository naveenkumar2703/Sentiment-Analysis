2	I like the complex it's very quit and calm.I should really be giving this place 1 star though because their maintenance is horrible I've been here for 6 months and have had a problem with a leak that wets my carpet and smells really bad. Every time I speak with the manager she says it's been fixed yet it rains again and I find myself with the same problem. I've expressed to her my concerns about the leak, holes in doors, non working closet doors, and it has not been fixed. I think waiting 6 months for repairs is ridiculous. They should really replace the manager and get someone else.
1	Only one pool that's always dirty. No fitness area. Crappy maintenance and upkeep of the apartments. Can't wait to move out!!
