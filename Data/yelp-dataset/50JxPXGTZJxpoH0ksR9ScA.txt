3	This is yet another offering of antique shopping in the Melrose District.  They have a pretty decent selection in this store, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  The organization of this store could be better, and you better be pretty agile if you are going to get around without knocking something over.  The prices are fairly average, some things being a great deal, other things being very clearly overpriced.  As with all antique stores, there is always the chance that you could find something amazing, so I would definitely recommend that you at least check the place out.
1	Can't believe they sell nazi items here.  Will never be back as well as their customer service and knowledge was  very poor.
5	My husband and I received wonderful service here.  Very charming shop, nice selection.  We purchased a perfect hobnail sugar dish and a nice puppy print with a frame.  The salesman was so pleasant and helpful, we enjoyed our visit to this shop.
