5	When I rolled into town without my A/C working, I headed straight over to see Harry Fuller at Purcell's Tire for a solution. Gotta have your A/C in tip-top working condition in Arizona! With a little troubleshooting, my A/C was back up and running. I can't thank the guys enough for fitting me into their schedule on a Friday night on a holiday weekend to fix my car! Major kudos to this location/company. Thanks guys! I would recommend Purcell's to anyone who is in the area for A/C work or better yet...buy some tires here too!
5	My mom had been complaining about her car leaking this and that, and potentially not being safe.  I live out of town, and I was concerned.  While visiting Phoenix last week, my sister, my mom, her car and I went to Purcell Tire & Service where we met Harry Fuller.  Harry instantly understood the situation, found the most economical way to evaluate the car, and offered real solutions for a reasonable price.  Harry was honest, clear, and forthright.  I would definitely recommend taking your car problems to Harry.  From here out, we will be faithful customers!
5	Took my SUV to Harry for a bad vibration.  Turned out to be bad tires(not very old Coopers).  I unfortunately bought the vehicle with the tires on it so I had no proof of purchase.  Harry sold me a set of Hankooks.  Love them and no more vibrations or road noise. Has another customer for as long as he wants me.
