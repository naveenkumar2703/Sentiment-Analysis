2	I know McDonald's isn't haute cuisine, but the food here is crappy compared to other locations.
1	Like most people, I went to the drive thru. I ordered a Daily Double meal like usual. I went to the 1st window and the cashier said, "You got Daily Double, no onion, pickle or mustard?" No, I got the Daily Double with all of the fixins-- thanks for assuming *rolls eyes.* I get my order and I realized that I got the wrong drink. Instead of getting a Sprite, I got a Coke. I quickly walked back over and asked them if I could quickly get my Sprite. The worker was less than nice and took his sweet damn time getting me a Sprite. All along I saw what I believed to be a regular Sprite right in front of me. I asked him if that's mine and he's like, "uhhh...no." So I get my cup, totally relieved-- then I noticed that the cup felt light. I opened the cup to see that it wasn't even filled all of the way and with little ice and no bubbles. Hmm...a clear liquid with no bubbles; does that sound like Sprite to you? No, and it wasn't. It was water (not even cold too). So now I am pissed because I told this punk politely for Sprite at least TWICE. So I go into the restaurant and get it replaced. Then the manager asked me if I got my order and I said yes. Now I'm thinking that my meal is also wrong. I go back into my car to find they did give me the wrong meal. I went back into the restaurant FOR THE THIRD TIME to get my meal. All awhile customers are pitying me saying, "They really screwed that up, didn't they?" No fucking shit.By the time I ate my burger, I lost my apetite.The competency of this staff is beyond disappointing. I am definitely going to another McDonalds if not another restaurant because of this.
