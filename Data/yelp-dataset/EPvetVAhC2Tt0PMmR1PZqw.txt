4	I bank with Wells Fargo, so any branch is fine with me.  This one happens to have converted to the check scanning deposits without an envelope and that's quite convenient!I had to stop a second time because the armored truck person was emptying the ATM machines.  Do they have to close everything outside when they're doing this?  You definitely lost a star when I had to come back to make the deposit.
4	This is my favorite Wells Fargo branch in town!  It's not the closest to my house, but I'll take the extra drive to come here.Best part...there's never a wait.  Most of the time I can walk right up to the window and do my banking business.  And the inside layout is really nice, clean, and well laid out.  The employees are always very nice and friendly too!My personal banker, Nancy, is also at this location.  She's really nice!  Goes above and beyond to help you with whatever your wants or needs are.  I recommend her to anyone that needs a great banker for assistance with your needs.
