5	Really great. We got them mixed up with another company and they barely charged us for completely wasting their time.
5	My AC went out mid summer I called my regular techs no response so I called ARA the came out 20 mins later found problem had to replace outside unit I knew it was going to happen.  the next day was the weekend they replaced it checked my other unit at no extra charge and no charge for the weekend repair. Great service
