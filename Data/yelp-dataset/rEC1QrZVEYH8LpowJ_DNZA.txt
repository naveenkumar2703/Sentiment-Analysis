4	Okay, so I am a sucker for Panda Express.  You may think it is not Chinese food, but I gotta tell you that their Orange Chicken is to die for.  The store at Thunderbird and 40th Street is fast (usually) and offers hot and fresh food.  Expect to stand in line (out the door) if you arrive between 5-6 p.m. on weekdays.  Overall, a quick place to get chinese food served fresh and hot.  My favs:  Orange Chicken, Chicken with Mushroom, and Mandarin Chicken.  Tip:  if you are on a diet, buy the kids meal.  It comes with one side and one entree, plus a cookie and a drink.  Give the cookie to your kid, order Ice Tea or Diet Coke, and enjoy!
5	Employees: A+++++++++++++++++++  Food A++ If I could give them 10 stars, I would.  Every single employee always smiles and is very friendly.  The food is always fresh.  This is my favorite panda and it is close to where I work.  We come here often for take out  and I have never had a bad experience.
4	Obviously there are more gourmet Chinese food restaurants around... but Panda always hits the spot for me.  The service is always speedy and friendly (at all of the many locations I've visited), and the food is pretty darn tasty.  The Beijing Beef and new Honey Sesame chicken are tasty, and you can't skip the chow mein noodles.  Yum!
4	Panda is consistently good and fresh,  that's why they are always busy! Gourmet Chinese it isn't,  but you can't beat the friendly workers and consistent fresh eats. My new favorite is the honey walnut shrimp. I usually get that for both choice.
4	Had to wait for a few entrees to cook but they apologized and gave me a small entree for my wait which was super cool since I didn't even complain about the wait :)
