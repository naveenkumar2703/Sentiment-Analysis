4	Staff knows their supps & vitamins & all the things in between.. I like this particular store... Always friendly.. Good promotions.. Such as my fav.. Join the free membership program.. Keep the receipt..& whatever you bought in last 30 days... Will be half off next time you buy.. Love a good sale.. Love good service.. Especially if it helps me stay in the healthy..
2	Decided on a new fitness program and included in that were a list of supplements I needed to get.  I walked in here and wasn't greeted until I was practically at the counter staring the guy down and even once he finally acknowledged me I felt like I had to drag him around to try to find the things I was looking for.  I would ask where one item was and once he showed me he'd start walking away and I would have to ask him to wait because I needed other things to.  After a couple rounds of that I decided to just find everything myself.  I don't know if he pre-judged me and thought I wasn't going to buy anything because I look young or because I was in gym clothes but either way it was wrong.  The best part was once I had about 3 different things loaded up in my arms he realizes that I was actually going to spend money and maybe he should be more helpful.  THEN he started helping me compare things and explaining different deals they had going on.  At that point I pretty much had everything I needed/wanted so I was ready to go.  At the counter he did give me a $10 off coupon for next month which helped a little bit but I was still irritated with the lack of service I'd been shown originally.
