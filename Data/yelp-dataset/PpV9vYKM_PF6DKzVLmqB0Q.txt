5	They were great. I had a living social coupon for routine inspection and maintenance check. They arrived on time and were very personable. He went right to work completing the inspection. Incidentally, I had noticed my electric bill had gone sky high the previous month but I didn't mention it to this guy. He then told me he had found a leak in my unit, and wanted to fix it, no extra charge to me, even though I expected to pay for anything above just an inspection and cleaning. Sure enough my electric bill was low again the next month and my AC didn't seem to be working as hard. I was very impressed!
5	Wonderful service. Dan, the owner,  is a stand up guy and extremely professional. They came out when they said they would and were very straightforward. Their card is on my fridge. I would highly recommend.

5	I'm a small business owner with 2 A/C units.  About 4 months ago, one of Bell's competitors, who are very well known in the Phx area I might add, came out of repair one of our units.  They first time their guy showed up, he said nothing was wrong.  Second time he came out he said there was, replaced a motor, and charged us over $900.  I called Bell A/C today, Chris and Albert showed up within 1-2 hours after my call, and were very professional and fixed out issue right away.  I would highly recommend these guys.  Honest company.
5	Bell A/C is great, very professional and prompt.  They service my home as well as my office and are always very informative about what is going on with both of my systems and never try to upsell me with unnecessary products or repairs.  They also were life savers last year when we had an emergency on Labor Day at my dad's house, who wasn't even a customer at the time, and Dan sent over his closest technician to get the A/C back on and functioning properly.  It was a relief to know I could call someone that I could count on.  I highly recommend using Bell A/C for all of your cooling needs!
5	Spoke with Dan the owner.  Told him what my issue was, meaning that my A/C isn't working.  He advised me that he will send a technician out, time frame 7-10 PM.  His technician Chris came out at 6:37 PM, ahead of scheduled time, which is a big plus in 100 degree weather, and got the unit fixed in a matter of minutes.  Great company, fast service, and very reliable.  If you need an HONEST service, this is the place to choose.  Keep up the good work.
5	My girlfriend and I contacted Bell after calling a few others she had seen on Angie's list, I told her I used to live in surprise next to   The owner  in a home I had rented in Surprise, after calling and finding out that they not only had the lowest service fee that they also didn't charge us any emergency fee. Albert was our technician, he was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable. He diagnosed and fixed the issue within a couple hours. Great company I would recommend to anyone looking for AC needs.
5	Very prompt and thorough service. I actually used them again for a second job that was also well done. I highly recommend.CL
