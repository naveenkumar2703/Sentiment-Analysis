3	Long lines. good cars, far from airport (well, the entire car rental depot is far!), friendly staff. That's about it!
4	We rented a car from National for our week in Sedona.  It was a 2010 or 11 Infiniti G37 and it worked just fine for the 3 of us.  There was a wait to check in for the car but it wasn't impossible and returning the car at the end of the week was quick and easy.  The rental car complex is a distance from the terminals, but shuttle buses circulate frequently and the ride is relatively short.  It's new and comfortable.  The art on display in the hallway on the way to the bathrooms was interesting and attractive.  The building is easy to navigate.  It was a good experience
4	This car rental location has a bypass the counter, has great selection of cars AND it's easy to get in and out of.There was a real nice selection of cars - I got my Charger again and there is a gas station close by.And how can anyone not like being here!
4	great selection.  fast check out and easy to check in.
