4	Mystic Paper is a very cute paper arts store in downtown Mesa.  While it caters to mixed media artist with its array of found objects and distressed papers it also offers ideas to create scrapbooks with a vintage feel.Weather you are new to paper arts or an old pro I would recommend checking out the classes at Mystic Paper.  While you can view them on their web site nothing compares to seeing and touching them in person.  This store is definitely worth a visit!
4	I love this place because it's so nostalgic and beautiful, and the supplies here are quite unique, with vintage and antique things sold there.I enjoy browsing the shop and looking at beautiful things for inspiration but my fiance is quite uncomfortable even standing there...:p...coz the supplies there are quite pricey, and there were no people except us and the staff :p
5	I love this place! Its so charming and makes me feel so inspired. I love all of the antique/ vintage items they have, and the prices are great! Its like they went and did all the hard work by searching antique and thrift stores for all of these cute / rare things and have it all there for customers for such reasonable prices.
