3	Solid gas station among the suburban sprawl of Las Vegas. Comparable prices with other fillin' stations nearby.I'll return.
2	Decent gas station. In the middle of nowhere, I was asleep for most of the trip. Lots of variety when it comes to snacks, drinks and everything else. I was able to pick up some cough drops for my coming cold. The bad part was the line for the restroom was sooooo long and it was so disgustingly dirty. Lots of girls going into the guy's room. Staff is nice. There were cops out front, weird experience. Definitely a pit stop for travelers. Slot machines were on the wall for the people waiting for the restroom.
1	Bathroom was clean but the gas price I feel like is a lie!!!!!
