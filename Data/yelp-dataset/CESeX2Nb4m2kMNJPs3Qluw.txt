4	I called Moore's on New Years eve when my vehicle quit in rush hour traffic on the beltline. Being from out of town they looked to be the closest and their add said they provided service work. Their diagnosis of my problem, over the phone, was one they could not fix but were willing to tow me anywhere in the city tonight or my hometown tomorrow. Driver towed me to a friends home, I was a bit hesitant to see the bill, to my surprise there was no price gouging. Thanks for prompt and professional service under dangerous conditions.
5	I just moved to Madison a couple days ago and had a trip planned today for the 4th. As I was filling up my car at the BP down the road, I realized that I had locked myself out of my car. So there I was without any kind of transportation and not knowing a soul in town and along comes Moore's to save the day! The gas station attendants kindly pointed me in the right direction to Moore's and I had the pleasure of meeting a very kind employee who was more than happy to help me out of a bad situation and got me back on the road in less than 10 minutes. The employee (I wish I had asked for his name!) was very kind and I think took pity on me as a newcomer to the area when it came time to pay haha. I hope I won't have need of their services again, but I know if I do they will be the first towing company I call/recommend to friends.
1	They up-charged me once they arrived and charged my card more without my approval.  I asked for a receipt and they couldn't produce one.  Be warned:  they claim they neither have a computer nor a fax machine.  What?I ended up fighting with them through the credit card company.  Sketchy.
1	Unprofessional.  Damaged my vehicle during a routine door unlock and refused to take any responsibility.  Unapologetic, defensive, and rude service.
