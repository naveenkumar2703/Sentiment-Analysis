5	LOVE LOVE LOVE Vibetality! The name says it all. All positive, relaxing, but strong vibes. Erica and Patrick are amazing people!! I have tried vibration yoga, flow yoga, and floatation therapy. All have positively helped my mind, body, and soul. They have also given me insight on healthy nutrition for wellness. I am a beginner in yoga, and they help you at your own pace. Strongly recommend VIBETALITY!!!
5	The most amazing workout I have ever had! I was skeptical at first but after a month of doing the 15 minute workouts I was in better shape than when I was going to my personal trainer for OVER a year! Thank you guys so much for making working out so easy and for getting my body to a place where I can finally say I feel HOT!
5	Yoga on a vibrating plate? Sounds weird, works amazingly. Not only is Vibetality a welcoming and relaxing atmosphere with trinkets, clothes and accessories to buy, but Patrick and Erica are two of the most kind and thoughtful people I've met yet.    After encountering two girls raving about Vibetality and how amazing the 15 minute classes are--WITH actual results, I was determined to check it out. I emailed them and got a reply within the hour welcoming me and wanting to include me. Each class fits 10 people and they offer different Vibe classes like yogavibe, renewvibe and fitvibe.      I did both fitvibe and renewvibe and not only do I feel relaxed and calm, but stretched and literally still buzzing.    Other participants were praising their results and with the first experience I just had I don't doubt that I am hooked already--I'm already going back Saturday morning!
