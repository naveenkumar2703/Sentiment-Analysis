4	As much as I'd love to give them five stars for pure awesomeness, they don't have quite the selection at the Tempe store of their other stores.However, this location still has a very wide variety of art supplies for most any media (including ceramics). The employees are all artists themselves and can answer any questions you may have as well as offer advice from experience--as opposed to whatever brand's offering kickbacks this month.If you're looking for super-low-end cheap crap, Arizona Art Supply isn't your store. If you're looking to pay lower prices for quality art supplies, they'll hit the spot for most customers.
