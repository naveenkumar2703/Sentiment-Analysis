4	Have taken my shirts and suits to be cleaned here several times.  They do a great job.  So far, I haven't lost any buttons on my shirts due to "over pressing" and when I tell them "light starch" they really do use "light starch".....perfect!The prices aren't bad and you can usually find a coupon in the mail.Return Factor - 95%
5	Not only do they do good work but the woman that manages the place is on top of her game and customer concious as well as very cordial
2	Time for a review update.  Since my first review 2 yrs ago, we've used Max's several times when they have coupons.  Oftentimes, the coupons are deceptive.  For instance, it will have a discount for shirts....but when we take the shirts in for cleaning they'll charge us much more.  When asked why, they say "well, this shirt is silk therefore it costs more".....wait, what?  There's no restrictions on the coupon!  Doesn't matter, won't win the argument.  Oh well, we moved on to another cleaner.Too bad because we live nearby.Return Factor - 2%
