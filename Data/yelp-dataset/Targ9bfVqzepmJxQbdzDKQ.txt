5	This is the best spa I've found since I moved here in December.  I am very picky and the girls remembered me and what I like and what I don't like. They made me feel very comfortable and welcome.  They are sweet, clean, fast and the polish last a very long time.
5	I got the most expensive pedicure. It was well worth it. I was there for about an hour. The place was very clean, clean tools, friendly, and they made me feel comfortable ever since I walked in. They also gave me a complementary water bottle and they also offer soft drinks. They have a vast variety of nail polishes. I can't wait to go back for another pedicure! The girl took her time and was very gentle and explained everything she was doing and why.
3	I have mixed feelings on this salon. It's super clean and cute. The staff was friendly. I really liked my pedicure, the nail tech did a good job, but didn't do anything to my cuticles. My manicure was done by someone else and was only so-so. Never soaked my fingers, again nothing done to my cuticles, and she used the buzzer thing they use to rough up your nails for acrylics, except I was just getting a shellac manicure. I HATE the buzzer thing and when I asked to not have it she said my polish wouldn't hold- however I've never had a salon use the buzzer before. I'd maybe go back for a pedicure, but no way would I go back for a shellac manicure.
5	Brought my friends there for their nails done and we were impressed of the place:   clean,  comfortable seats, reasonable price, and GREAT customer services.  We definitely come back again.  Thank you!
5	I decided to get a pedicure here after seeing the reviews and im glad I did...the nail tech is the most gentle I've ever had.   My nails were terrible and the tech worked on a toenail possibly ingrown from my last experience at another salon.I got the citrus pedicure and highly recommend it.  Phoenix is flip flop central and my feet look and feel great.....
