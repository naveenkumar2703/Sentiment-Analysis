5	Gina is an excellent resource for all your dental staffing needs!!  I have worked with her since 2002!  She screens applicants VERY carefully and is amazing at her job. I would highly recommend her for any applicant looking for a dental position, or an employer looking for that next amazing staff member!!
5	Gina is top notch. If you are seeking a career not just another job, seek Gina. She works hard to put quality workers with quality employers. She is great at what she does.
2	I recently moved to the area and registered with every dental staffing agency in the valley as a dental hygiene candidate looking for work.  My interview process here was very impersonal and could have been completed by email.  I was only asked a few simple questions.  I was also asked to bring a letter of recommendation to the meeting if I have one, and when I presented it to Gina she was very confused about why I would bring it.  She wouldn't make eye contact with me at that point and awkwardly set the letter aside.  Nothing about the hiring or temping process was explained to me at all, and after a month I've heard nothing from them, while other agencies have kept me busy with temping.  Gina had poor body language when interviewing me, and I left the office believing I would likely never hear back anyway.  It was upsetting because I connected VERY well with the other two staff members at the office while we waited for Gina to come to our meeting 15 minutes late.  I believe they are holding the office together.  But not contacting me is her loss, because I found a full time job very quickly.
