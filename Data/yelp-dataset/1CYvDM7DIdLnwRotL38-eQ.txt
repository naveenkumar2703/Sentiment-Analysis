4	This is a lovely little antique store tucked away in a small strip mall right beside Lollypop Vintage.  It has quite a bit of higher end jewelry if you are looking for a really nice piece for a special occasion.  The owner is knowledgeable, very courteous and will consider buying antique or pre-1945 items, which I listed in one of the photos. Limited hours... but definitely worth a look.
5	What a great little antique store in Phoenix, AZ.  One of the first things that I noticed about this little shop is that IT SMELLS GOOD!!!  The place is clean and well kept - not like many of the typical antique shops.  Kudos to the owner, Gary for maintaining such a pleasurable shop!The shop is filled with tons of goodies - raning from turquoise jewelry, lamps, period-era memorabilia, photos, etc.  While in Phoenix, I visited over 15 antique shops, and this one took the cake!  Prices are reasonable, and the customer service is outstanding!  Very pleasant to deal with and no pushy salespeople.I went in looking for a turquoise cowboy belt buckle, and left with some snazzy Zuni Indian turquoise cufflinks.  SNAZZY!Highly recommended!
1	Wish I would've gotten to see the inside. I got here at 10:55 and the door sign said they opened at 11am so I waited. It was 11:05 still not open so I went to the antique shop across the street Xamelback Antiques (a lot of stuff, cool stuff). I spent about 30 minutes there then went back to Picture The Past now it's 11:42 and still not open. I tried opening the door and the young man inside just stared at me so I walked away and left.
