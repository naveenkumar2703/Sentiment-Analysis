5	Hospice of the Valley is awesome!  And the people from Hospice of the Valley are awe-inspiring!A few years ago my dad needed their help.  They were amazing in how well and how smoothly they entered the picture and did their job.I recommend Hospice of the Valley to anyone who is in that kind of a situation.Additionally, the Social Worker who worked with my dad is NOT an MSW:  He's a Ph.D. in Social Work!  When I asked him about that, telling him that I expected that a Ph.D. would be in a classroom teaching - not out in the field, he told me that while he had taught for a short time, he wasn't happy teaching - instead of talking about it, he wants to be on the front lines doing it.  I can't overemphasize how good he is or how impressed I am.
1	Hospice of the Valley for someone with dementia. They will drug your loved one up so much that they fall into a comma and then 10 to 15 days later will die of dehydration. Although your loved one's quality of life was zero there is a difference for the person that signed the paperwork allowing it to happen and when God allows it to happen. End of life care is hard on the person who signs and people should know this is what they are signing before it happens.
