4	I couldn't help but go into this shop when I was walking by. As all cooking enthusiasts should know, Aga is the royalty of cookers, stoves and fridges. However, as I ventured inside, lone be hold Aga actually sell more than this! Indeed, inside the shop I was surrounded by gleaming Kitchen accessories! From toasters to pots and pans, this Aga Shop had it all! And once in a while in a shop you do imagine what that product would be like in my flat!? And whilst I was in the Aga shop I couldn't help but think of my ideal kitchen and how it would be full of Aga products. However, as a student, my bubble was soon burst when I started to look at the prices. Aga products are expensive!!!! But what a vision to have, that someday, you will be able to afford at least one Aga product! If you want to dream of that future kitchen then Aga will be a source of inspiration!
