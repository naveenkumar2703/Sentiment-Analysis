5	I get most of my clothes from this Savers. It's the best. They moved here about 2 years ago, after the one in Mesa closed down. We loved that one so much too. But we are happy that it's closer to the highway, so when we are done shopping, we can go straight home quicker. The variety of clothes is great and many colors. This one is the best.
4	I just recently discovered thrift shopping. Yes, I know, it's as if I was living under the rock. Anyhow, I think this is mu favorite thrift store. It is wide, has good selection and almost always some discount is going on. I usually buy small kitchen appliances (why spend $80 on bread maker, when they have several great ones to choose from, all for $6). Clothes is hit and miss, as it is with any thrift store, but if you have time and nerves to stop by often, there are some really nice finds there.
4	I always like to swing by this Savers at least once a week (maybe twice)...usually on customer appreciation day, so it's 25% off your purchase. I am a jeans junkie to the max, and I've been able to find Miss Me and Big Star jeans at a very good price....RECENTLY!!This store is clean and organized most of the time with the exception of 50 % sale days...lol.  My only criticism would be, that I NEVER seem to be able to find the sale color tag items in the racks that are 50% off, very strange.   Happy hunting!!
5	Awesome service!  I accidentally donated my new steamer instead of my used one.  They promptly found my steamer and promptly exchanged it.  They made my day!
