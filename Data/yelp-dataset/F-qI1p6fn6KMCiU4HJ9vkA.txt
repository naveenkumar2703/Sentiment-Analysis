4	Update: They added lots more space, and a terrace! Yay!
5	Great service.  Gentleman who waited on me was very polite and patient. The atmosphere is very relaxing. Almost feel asleep on couch. At the time of my visit there were a lot of students working in their laptops and a lot of in and out traffic of people passing by to grab a beverage. Bathroom was in decent shape all things considered but not spotless. Wifi also tested at about 6gbs.  I see myself being a regular here.
