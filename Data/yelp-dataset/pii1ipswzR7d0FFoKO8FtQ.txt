5	This place is a hidden jewel.  The food and the presentation of it are stellar, the people are very down to earth and approachable.  There is no need to deal with the strip on a thursday evening for  nice dining and entertainment if you like live music.  The evening I went Hajee was entertaining, we had a wonderful time.  Thank you to the staff for being top of the line in customer service and for providing a wonderful dining environment. I cant wait to return!
1	This place sucks. They don't have a sign up.   Asked to buy another hookah set & they ran out. If they're going to be a hookah lounge, they need to make sure they're stocked. They're flavor sucks. Taste like burnt. Can't taste no flavor at all. Looked around the room and and there wasn't that many ppl so how can they run out? Looked like they only have 15 set. The lady with the accent isn't around to help. She's always missing. The place is small. Never coming back. Horrible service.
1	This is not about food or the restaurant side. This is about the Monday night new "night club", "karaoke", and "live band" side. They are doing all three of those acts in one night, but it is just not something they have planned out very well. Pretty much they are new I guess, but they do not have their ducks in a row at all. Their bar had only three beers then they ran out of the one I was drinking after only having two. I just felt like they should not have been open yet and did DJ auditions during a closed time because the transition of the band, DJ, and karaoke in between was just hard to watch. Maybe it will turn itself around when it comes to the night club part, but from my expereince I will never return.
