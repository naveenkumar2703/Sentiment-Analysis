5	Incredibly fast, polite & professional. High quality work at very reasonable prices
5	Dave took his skilled eye and his complete set of tools to my wife's Mercedes and saved me the time and money a full body shop repair would have taken.  Can't see a thing ever happened to her baby with my car door!  Thanks, Dave.
5	Took my 2013 Scion FR-S to Dave. He fixed 2 nasty door dings in a couple of hours and the price was very reasonable. Could NOT tell the dings were ever there. Highly recommend.
5	Dave is the best in the business. I've had experience with auto body repair myself, and his skills were amazing, he uses quality equipment and super bright directional lights (think of the kind photographers use, with the white light you see on the showroom floor at luxury Car Dealership) those light and advanced tools used by the techs only found in the finest Italian body shops is what seperates Dave from the normal dealership guy. He's the kind of professional that is more an artist then repair guy. It took Dave about 15 minutes to roll out a quarter sized ding in my lift gate on my 5 door hatchback. My car is coated in a Pearl white and you would never be able to see were there was a dent. I was amazed at his craftsmanship and how polite he and his wife were - 7pm on a week night is never a time when anyone wants to work but Dave had no problem working around my Army schedule and getting everything done.If you need a dent fix call him ASAP!
5	I was really surprised to read the last review. I have gone to Harry a few times and he has always been helpful.I have never had an issue with him. He has always done right by me.
