3	This is a locals hair cut place mostly for Vietmese in the area.  The good thing they know how to cust Asian hair and it was clean and straight.  Hair cuts for guys was only $9 bucks.
3	This is where i get my hair cut every two weeks like clockwork.  Its in chinatown and i always get my nice fade to a blend from julie.  Ive been coming here almost a year now,  shes super nice and even though im not sure what shes saying sometimes,  we have good conversation.  As far as haircut places go,  Julie and the rest of the staff do a great job,  and are super l chill.  As far as deals go... I cant argue with a $10 haircut.  Standard fade for $10 yes please.  Cheers!
5	Kia was so wonderful! She kept my layers long and got rid of all the dead ends :) not to mention great conversation.
