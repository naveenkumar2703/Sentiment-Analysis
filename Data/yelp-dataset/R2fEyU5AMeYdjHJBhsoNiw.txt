5	Karen is the best.  Her specialties include therapy for individuals, couples & children:             Anxiety and Depression            Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)            Chronic Illness            Betrayal/Divorce            Grief and Loss            Major Life TransitionsI added her business to yelp because this is something people SHOULD be yelping about.  Great food reviews are nice, but Karen is actually helping me become a better person - which is pretty cool.  I was a complete "Doubting Thomas" prior to spending time with her, but she's sweet, and I would recommend her to anyone.  GREAT JOB KAREN!!
5	Karen has a gentle and easy way of making you understand the patterns in your life.  She helps you turn these patterns into positive paths.  I love her energy and she has helped me in my life in amazing ways. I would highly recommend her.
