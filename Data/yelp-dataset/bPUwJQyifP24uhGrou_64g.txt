1	This Wendy's is a training facility. You get what what you pay for. If its something they don't have to assemble your safe, otherwise don't even slow down to make the turn.
1	Previous review: training facility, I guess that says it all.  I tried to stop in last night for a quick bite but after waiting about eight minutes to get to the order box no one took my order.  I got a "be with you in a moment" twice before I just drove off.
1	Absolute worst service.  Tremendously long wait. Three cars took over 15  minutes in drive through.  Each car waited 5minutes to order.  I thought they were ordering a bunch of burgers but when it was my turn to wait it also took 5 minutes.  Poor people stuck behind me.  There goes their entire lunch break.  No quick burger run here.  Drive a little bit further and get done quicker.
