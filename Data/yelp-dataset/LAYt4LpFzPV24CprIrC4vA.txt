3	Although a little scruffy with its appearance, an awkward isle layout and random product placement justify this, the Tollcross Superstore houses plenty of useful items and convenient buys.There's a whole row donated to Polish brand pickles, a variety of rice layering the next and the odd unusual packet of spice here and there.Cheap, cheerful, convenient. Nothing more.

It is rare that a shop like this is able to compete with all the big name stores in the area, but ti does and it does it by offering great quality and value.  It's eggs for example are about 50p cheaper per dozen than anywhere else in the area and we would never consider buying them elsewhere.Beyond rambling on about how many great deals you can get from here the best thing I can do is to tell you about how popular it is.  I sit in my kitchen and watch the people go into this shop and I can tell you that someone goes in consistantly every 3 minutes or so during the busier parts of the day.  If it wasn't delivering it simply wouldn't be this popular.  It is well worth coming here it feels a bit like a large corner shop, but it is great value for money.
