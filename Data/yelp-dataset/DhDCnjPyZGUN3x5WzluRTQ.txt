5	Bruce saved my day, my computer crashed this morning and I gave him a call and he was able to come out same day.  He went through my whole system at my office and even updated my anti-virus with a free AVG instead of paying for that crappy Norton service.  He was able to go through and recover all my files and found out the operating system was corrupted.  He saved my day and completed everything same day.  Thank you Bruce!
5	Bruce from Computer Troubleshooters has been doing my business computers and home computer since December, 2010.  He takes alot of the pressure off my husband by keeping everything updated and backed up.  I would recommend Bruce for all of your business and personal computer needs.
5	Bruce is awsome!  When I had a blue screen (yes blue:-( ) . One call & Bruce was on the case.  He backed up my memory & then he did what he needed to get me up & running again.  Nothing lost on my computer!  I also used him to unlock my computer from a program.  He did this online from his home and I was at mine. :) 10 minutes and fixed! I highly recommend Computer Troubleshooters for all your computer needs.
