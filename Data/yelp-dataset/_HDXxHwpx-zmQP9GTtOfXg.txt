5	It is quite a boon to have an independent theater nearby. The single cinema generally has special nights of (cult) classics as well as new films that lie somewhere between decent and stupendous. I've seen very eclectic movies here: slacker, 2001, woman in the dunes, INLAND EMPIRE, etc. If you get a copy of the paper you'll be able to find out what themes they have on for the month (for example, a particular director's filmography). The theater itself usually has a decent audience that won't chomp chomp their popcorn in your ear while texting and the seats themselves are pretty comfortable.It is $7 for members, but UW students can pick up tickets for $6 at the turnkey desk. In the wintertime get some hot apple cider before watching the film - surprisingly good!
5	It's rare for me to find a place that places indie films. Surprisingly, Waterloo's little gem is the Princess Cinemas. They play all the indie films that you're just trying to find for a cheap price. They also play some cult classics such as the Rocky Horror Picture Show during Halloween.Great date place.
5	Amazingly lucky to have a independent theater running regularly just downtown. Not only that but it's charm is cozy and classy all wrapped under cinema lights and the glowing movie posters outside.When inside you'll see a small cafe perfect for a pre movie snack or after movie cuppa. The theater itself is small, but perfectly suitable for the movies it plays. Part of its goodness are the numerous movies it plays. From nostalgic Wes Anderson's to spicy comedy's it will always be playing something meant for everyone.
