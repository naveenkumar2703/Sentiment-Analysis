1	I have enjoyed banking with desert schools until I moved to Mesa.  The branch located at 4330 E Southern Ave Mesa, AZ 85206 gives desert schools a bad name.  They are by far the slowest location I've been to. I have been stuck in the drive thru line for 45 minutes...when I arrived there were only two cars in front of me and three cars in the next lane. I recently left my card there (100% my fault) and never did they have the courtesy to call me.  When I picked up my card I was told they normally shred the cards, it was my lucky day.  Horrible customer service at this location.  I will go back to using the one in central phx (on 7th).
1	I have to agree with Stephanie.  The service is terribly slow. Especially the drive thru.  After waiting in line for ever, I decided to just park and go inside.  Slow there too but got out faster than staying in the drive thru.  My wife and I went in on a Saturday to finance a car.  Went thru the app process, was told they would contact me on the following Monday.  Nothing.  Went online after a couple of weeks to request a call or some sort of contact.  I got an email back saying to come drive down to the nearest branch for service. Finally called again and after fighting with the phone prompt and staying on hold for 10 min, got a  hold of lady in the phone center. (note: not a branch rep). She had to look up my app and tell me the results. Forget it.  Went to Bank of America.  Got an instant answer and great percent rate.  May be pulling out Desert Schools if this kind of service keeps up.
