4	Definitely great authentic Pakistani good. Not as good as Pakwan in the bay area, but their Nihari was really good. Naan was fresh. Hole in the wall good food and really cheap too. Would definitely return here if for some reason I ever found myself in Kitchener, Ontario ever again. However, if you are here and are looking for great Paki / desi food, then this is the place to go.
4	Very delicious and authentic Indian food. Inexpensive too!
5	Good Daal, Tandoori Butter Chicken.
