2	The newest Ross in tempe is open!The store is new, clean and tidy. However the selection is lacking here. The Shoe dept had much open space.The art was just a hand full of pictures.I like the cleanliness, it is much cleaner than the Tempe marketplace location. But more items are needed, I did not find anything to buy.
3	This location is clean and organized, but I find that the selection here is lacking in comparison to other ones. The departments were smaller than what I'm use to. They still have cute finds there. I got an awesome area rug for cheap. And for the older customers, 55 and above, you can get a 10% discount on Tuesdays.
4	Ross?  No, not for the clothes--the kitchen supplies!That stuff that didn't sell at other places sells here for cheaper.  You never know what you are going to find, but I espied a set of Cuisenart kitchen knives (over a dozen pieces including steak knives) here for $40.  Torani syrups (various flavors) for $7 each retail!  You can always find an endless array of pans, pots, choppers, cookers and holders for substantially less than what you would find them at other stores.Sometimes you really hit the jackpot here, and sometimes you don't, but you can outfit your entire kitchen here for cheap if you don't mind mixing and matching.
3	This Ross is uncluttered and spacious, but maybe a little too spacious? There wasn't a lot of selection of clothes and home goods when we were here. They do have a whole row dedicated to pet goods, which was nice to browse through.
5	I love this place, quite and organized. Everything is on the place. Great!
1	I don't know what people are buying here but the lines are always crazy long. I've found name brand clothes for cheaper where they originally sell their stuff at. A huge disappointment, skip it.
