5	It's been 5 years since I've had my eyes checked. I've been wearing the same (fashion-faux pas) generic glasses just as long. Once I get that "hair up my arse" to do something... I know I've got to do it or I simply won't be able to live with myself for the rest of the day. Today, I decided I needed to get new glasses. I walked in and veered left to the optometrist where I found a pleasant, smiling receptionist. Despite the fact that she was on the phone she said hello to me and offered me to sit while she finished her call and could answer questions.About 3 monutes later she hung up and promptly appologized for taking so long. I know 3 minutes isn't much but I really appreciate when people recognize that my time matters... 10 minutes or 30 seconds. My first question... "How much is it for a glasses only eye exam?".I know this is obsolete to a lot of people... but I don't like having to pay out the arse for something un-necessarily, so her response thrilled me. $69 for a glasses only eye exam which is great in comparison to Lensecrafters $94! I browsed the selection of glasses they had while I was waiting to be called back and while I wasn't totally thrilled with any of their styles (because my heart was already set on a sleek pair of Wayfarers made by Ray-Ban) they had a wide selection to suit just about everyone. I waited only 15 minutes before the receptionist (please forgive me for forgetting her name, I should remember because she was simply pleasant) called me back for the air test. I was placed in a room and told Dr. Garcia would be with me shortly. Once again, the service was speedy. I must have only been in that room for 5 minutes... The exam was thorough but quick and Dr. Garcia was fabulously nice!I walked out in under an hour (just as advertised) with perscription in hand! I would recommend this place to anyone, reguardless of whether or not you actually get your glasses here. =)
