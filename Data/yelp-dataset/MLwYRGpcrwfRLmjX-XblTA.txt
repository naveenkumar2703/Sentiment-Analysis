5	Love this place!!!!
5	Great place! nice and friendly, great service!
5	The owner is awesome and laid back, but very professional and knows what he's doing and talking about.  He has trustworthy engine shops and tuners he works with, like Shawn Church.  I would recommend this shop to any import enthusiast!
5	Shawn Church tuned my turbo honda fit in roughly 15 minutes using his DynaPack Dynamometers.  He's tuned my Honda several times, all very successful!  He is one of the most talented, if not the most talented automotive tuner in the country....and he's now opened a small satellite shop here in Las Vegas!!!I had my car tuned for a reasonable rate with no difficulties and was totally satisfied.  I would recommend any enthusiast a visit to FN Werks Performance (Church Automotive Testing located inside) to have their import, or any other model, to be tuned by Shawn or Daniel.  You would be amazed at how much power they can pull out of your car.Fernie and his crew are awesome people!  Take your project build or daily driver to this shop if you want a serious and high quality build n' tune.
5	Just want to say that this is by far the best place to take your car. Just got some work done on my DA, and they did a hell of a jod. Highly recommend F. N. WERKZ.
5	Got my car tuned by Shawn Church.  Shawn is about keeping my car safe and not trying to hit numbers. Great tuner. Great customer service.
