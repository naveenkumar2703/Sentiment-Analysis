5	Cafe Lito is awesome. I've tried several things and they are all outstanding. The food specials are awesome but the snacks are what bring me back again and again. The carmel pretzel sticks are to die for, especially the orange and lemon. The star of the show is the chili lime carmel corn. It is the best food when you need a little snack!  I would reccomend Cafe Lito to everyone. It is worth discovering.
5	Love this little hidden spot! The coffee and coffee drinks are good and reasonably priced.  And the food and snacks are so yummy.  Almost everything is made from scratch...it doesn't get much better than that!
