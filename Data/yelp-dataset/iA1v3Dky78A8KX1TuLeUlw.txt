3	I'm the nerdy sort of person who generally gets very excited when I think I've discovered a new bookshop.  In the case of Cornerstone, however, my excitement waned slightly when I realised that they exclusively sell Christian literature (the fact that the bookshop is attached to a church was probably a clue).  Not that I object to Christian literature per se, but it's not exactly my idea of light reading.In the spirit of tolerance and diversity, however, I can appreciate that for others this repository of books on spirituality and Bible interpretation might be a real treat, which is why I've generously decided to share it on Yelp.  I didn't peruse the shelves too closely, but they do appear to cover a broad range of religious subjects, from general faith guides to more specialised treatises on moral and philosophical issues.

An intimate, independent bookshop next to St. John's Church, it stocks Christian books, cards, stationary and gifts. Not being religious myself, I wasn't tempted to buy anything but the staff were welcoming and the titles seemed to cover everything from the spiritual to theological.
3	Talking snakes, non-existent dinosaurs, an old man parting the sea with his bare hands, and the genuine belief that the universe, galaxy, solar system and planet, were all constructed in just seven days, rather than the several billion years that scientific evidence seems to suggest.If you want to read all about loving thy neighbour (as long as his skin is the same colour as yours, and he isn't gay), then come on in.
