3	Another place that's walking distance. Subway is one of those places where you can't go wrong....you got 5-dollar value meals or foot longs. The guys are really friendly and aren't stingy with the toppings. I'm not a big fan of the smell subway's have though. Eh anyways its just one of those places where im lazy and don't want to make a sandwich...plus it helps me keep my girlish figure like jared :)
3	Yelp lists 3 stars as A-OK and that's exactly what this is.Great price, adequate sandwiches, fast service.  I've eaten at this location several times, it satisfies and tastes on a limited schedule.
2	Well- it's a subway. So the the standard sandwiches and services apply. I have never had bad service or food here- but the restaurant down on 43rd ave and Bell is generally cleaner, and the staff is a bit more friendly and outgoing.
4	This Subway has made it on our lunch rotation at work, and I've had more good experiences than bad.  We come so often they know some of our sandwich selections by heart.  It seems to be consistently busy but they get you through the line fairly efficiently.  My only gripe with the place is the mess of a parking lot.  Spaces are pretty limited and are a challenge to get in and out of especially if someone is turning in from the street at the same time you are trying to leave.  We've resorted to parking at the Mexican joint next door to avoid this.
