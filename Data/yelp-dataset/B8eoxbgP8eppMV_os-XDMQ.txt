5	I didn't buy anything from Snowlines, but I still have to write a review on the great customer service that was provided. They didn't carry much of what I was looking for (hiking shoes vs. running shoes), but the sales person was super helpful and tried his best to find something that might work for me. In the end, he apologized for not carrying what I was after, but that isn't his fault and I was just checking my options and seeing if they had something that might work (I already knew it might be a long shot). Other employees where working with customers on trying to get them the best running shoe for their style of running and that sort of attention to detail didn't go unnoticed by me. If I were local to Edinburgh and was really into the minimalist running movement, I would probably shop here for my running shoe needs.
