2	I really wanted to like you Apple Dumpling. I was sort of mislead thinking this was going to be Asian Dumpling place, but when we walked it, my friend said it was like stepping into her grandmother's house in the Midwest. We stayed despite completely different expectations, and it was good and tasty comfort food. They're known for their custard (with apple dumplings?), but they were out of custard when we were there. A few hours later, my friend and I were studying, and the food didn't sit right for either one of us. I'm not sure if its because they don't fry their food, and I don't know what alternative cooking method is used, but it didn't go over very well. Sorry Apple Dumpling, I tried!
1	This small out of the way cafe suffers from many problems, not the least of which is an indenity crisis. It doesn't know whether it is an office, (the manager's desk is in the dining area.) a cafe, an ice cream parlor or a kitschy antique store.The store had no real antiques, just the sort of craft work one generally finds at the swap mart.The menu is that of a brunchery with french toast, omlettes, egg dishes and baked goods. Sounded good. Unfortunately the execusion is where this cafe fell flat.The sausage and cheese omlette was obviously microwaved instead of being prepared in a pan on a stove, topped with a single slice of American processed pretend cheese. The french toast tasted very much like it was taken from the freezer and popped in a toaster. Bacon and sausage were of the lowest order, the bacon being so thin you could have read the paper through it and possesing no actual flavor at all.The promised "homemade" biscuits were such a disappointment that they went unfinished. I have had better biscuits at McDoanlds. Honestly, and McDonalds makes dreadful biscuits.Overall we were extremely disappointed in this little cafe and became even more so when the check arrived. The total price for this disaster was almost the same as if we had gone to a real resturaunt  but without any thing that approches the satisfaction one gets from dining on good food. The waitress/cook/manager very cheerfully gave us discount coupons for our next visit, we left them sitting on the table.The food was actually so disappointing and we ate so little of it that we  then went someplace else to have our breakfast.If you're hungry and are thinking about stopping by The Apple Dumpling Cafe for a bite, I recommend McDoanlds, the food will be cheaper and NOT microwaved, and be moderately better tasting.*******************************************************************************Well, a few days after posting this review I received a meesage from an owner of Apple Dumpling Cafe and after due consideration I thought I'd add my response to that message here as well. I will use their statements then respond to them, promotional comments have been edited out. Also I should like to point out that the location we visited is now closed and they have a new location in Queen Creek.ADC: "We have been in the Restaurant and catering for 25 years.Yes everyone has some off days. At Apple Dumplings, we cook everything up fresh, no cooking items and keeping them warm. Fresh eggs, not powdered or liquid eggs."DBABH: Now between my wife and myself we also have nearly 20 years of restaurant experience, everything from family dining all the way up to 4 star restaurants. We know what good food tastes like, this wasn't it.ADC: "Maybe you are not used to baked biscuits instead of warmed microwave ones."DBABH: Being a native of the west I have had my share of delicious, tender and tasty biscuits from campsites to local restaurants and no, the biscuits at the Apple Dumpling Cafe do not qualify. They were of poor quality and neither tender nor tasty.ADC: "Our business is growing in Queen Creek. Our Apple Burger has been called one of the best in the country by many."DBABH: I am sure the business is growing and that is a good thing. But the new location is far enough out to discourage this reviewer from giving them a second chance at the apple. Perhaps if I were in Queen Creek one day for another reason I might stop in, but given the low quality of food we received on our first visit I think the odds of that happening are long indeed.
3	came here for lunch last saturday and at first i thought it was called "the dump" because thats what it was being referred to. not in a bad way. lol. its a cute place, definitely wasnt crowded at all. in fact we were the only ones in there for a while. service was kinda slow even though we were the only ones in there[there is a sign that even says it is slow because everything is cooked to order] but im talking about like bringing drinks and taking out order, and the waitress has/had a really soft voice at first. their menu is pretty big. i got the mango chicken salad. it wasnt bad but i would have preferred it to not be served on a ton of lettuce that i didnt even eat all of it. the restaurant is also an ice cream parlor/antiques store. there is a lot of stuff that you can buy. didn't try the ice cream but the waitress brought us a sample of the apple pie fudge which was to die for!! we might have gotten some but it was hot out and we werent going right home. so all in all i would say to check this place out. its kinda off the wall but i dont really have any complaints. there breakfast menu looked good so i would say that this place is prob best for breakfast?!
