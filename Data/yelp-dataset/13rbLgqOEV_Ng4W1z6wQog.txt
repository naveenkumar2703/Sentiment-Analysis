1	I recently had a leaking tire on a Saturday evening on the other side of the city, my TPMS warned me, so I aired up and I ended up at the location on Luke AFB that uses this address in their invoices. I thought it would be a simple fix. Unfortunately they did not treat me very well (my opinion). I think (cannot prove) that they "added" a shiny, not a scratch on it after 30 miles, screw towards the rim of the tire to make me have to purchase a tire; instead of just fixing the nail that was in the center of the tread for $20. Interesting how both were in the tire along the same location, not much imagination, I guess. They conveniently had only one left of "their" brand of tire I would require, and it was quite expensive; much more than a quick search on my phone for a matching replacement showed. Then they wanted me to leave the tire with them until Monday while searching for a replacement. Not feeling very comfortable with the situation, I had them put the spare on and the "bad" tire in the back, at least they didn't charge me the $20, but nobody could look me in the eye afterwards. I limped home on the donut spare at 50 mph, pissed off, you know how it goes. I have no proof, just a feeling, and that feeling will keep me from doing any business with this company ever again.I ended up searching for another place and was specifically looking for a place that was open on Sunday. Got a great deal at a Big O Tires that is local and had a few good reviews. Now the the Big O Tire place has one more, they got my business, and I'll stop by there when it's time to replace tires when they are worn, NOT at a Firestone place.Don't people realize if you jip someone, you're more likely to tell 10 people not to use their services?
5	As long as I live in the Phoenix area I will take my Jeep here. The guys that work here are knowledgeable, fair, honest with great integrity. I have taken my jeep here many times and have always felt they were extremely helpful and professional.
