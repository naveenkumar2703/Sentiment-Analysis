5	THIS IS THE CLEANEST MY CARPET HAS EVER BEEN.... EVER.  Other carpet cleaners in the past always left my carpet looking like it had a shadow on it.  But this company left my carpet looking clean and bright and it was soft... not stiff.  I like that they use steam.  The water was super hot so I know that my carpet was germ free when they were done, a big plus since I have my grand kids crawling around on the carpet!  And they weren't flying at 100mph to get done.  They took their time and got it done right.  They got out ever single stain.  I have found my carpet cleaner for life.
5	Great little family owned operation. Everybody I dealt with was so nice and so professional. I didn't wait all day for them to show up and the spots on my carpet didn't come back when it dried. I'll be using them from now on.
5	This is the  absolute cleanest my carpet has ever been, it's like new! That says a lot as I have children that spill everywhere and my carpet was a total disaster!! Company was very professional and prompt which I really appreciated as I am very busy. Max even took the time to answer all my questions about how he would remove the stains because many have tried and none were able, but he worked his magic and they are gone! I have used CleanMax several times now and I am 100% satisfied everytime
5	Fantastic Service! Best carpet cleaner in town hands down
