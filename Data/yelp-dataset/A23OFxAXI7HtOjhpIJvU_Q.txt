4	Cruise is lovely.Whenever my brothers are in the city I always make sure I accompany them to Cruise. Yeah, it's a unisex shop but is aimed mainly at men, so I feel like a bit of a creep going in here alone. The clothes they sell are ultra high-end and ultra-expensive, but they are amazing. When I get my first proper 9-5 job, I plan to buy my power suit form here. The husband and 2.3 children will come later, I presume.They are a smaller version of Harvey Nichols for their brands and prices, but it's quite nice to feel posh, even if it's just for a few minutes!
3	I've never been the biggest fan of Cruise, I'm not really one for designer labels particularly when the brand name is displayed right across the front as with most items in Cruise.I like more low key designs and brands such as DKNY, Juicy Couture, Gucci and Fendi don't really interest me. Like Stephanie, I prefer the guys section to the ladies as the clothes seem a bit more understated and not as "look at me, I'm wearing a designer handbag". Most of the items in Cruise are over priced, predictable and just a bit naff but you can find the odd item that's rather nice, so I guess it's worth a look from time to time.
