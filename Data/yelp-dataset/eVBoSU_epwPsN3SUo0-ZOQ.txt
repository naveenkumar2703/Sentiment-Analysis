3	My first experience with this chain of Jimboy's Tacos was only a few months ago when I was in Reno. http://www.yelp.com/biz/BiPItVGi29qC0E2a2v_u2Q  Courtesy of Lena D. who informed me that they just opened a location in Las Vegas, NV, the BF was stoked when he heard the news!  We finally had a chance to check out this location on Charleston.Walking in, it definitely didn't look like the Jimboy's Tacos I encountered in Reno.  This one was a fancy chain restaurant with nice tables and chairs, for a chain restaurant.  The menu was still the same though.  I went for the Shredded Beef Taco and the Shredded Beef Quesadilla.  The BF went for three Shredded Beef Tacos himself.  He just loves their shredded beef there!  We also tried to order their Cream-filled Churros, but they were out!  So sad!  We also wanted a cup of horchata to wash our lunch down, but they didn't serve horchata at this location!  Argh!  What a disappointment!They also have a self serve area of hot sauces, lemons, and limes.  I always appreciate a place where you can stock up on your own hot sauces.  My taco and quesadilla were good, especially with all the hot sauces.  It wasn't the same without the horchata though.  And I felt a bit empty when I heard they were out of churros too.  At least it satisfies the cravings for Jimboy's Tacos though.  Word is they are planning on opening another location by the end of the year!Update! 02/04/07 - The BF went by Jimboy's Tacos today because he was craving it so bad and found out it was CLOSED!  They had a "For Sale" sign posted up!
4	Its a shame they closed this location, but Jimboys it a love it, hate it kind of place. I always thought they had the best ground beef tacos period! They should of had a location with a drive-thru.
