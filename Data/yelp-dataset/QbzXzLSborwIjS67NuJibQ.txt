5	I have rosacea so my skin is very temperamental.  Donna has spent a lot of time working with my condition & researching products that won't aggravate it.  We have it under control & my skin is as clear as it's ever been.  I feel like she really cares about providing great customer service, not only for me but for those that I have recommended to her.  I challenge you to find more value for your money...
5	As a makeup artist, I cannot stress enough the importance of good skin care. Makeup is not a replacement; it's to enhance. I find it best to stay authentic to who you are and not put on the mask. I found myself in need of a pick me up, so I discovered Donna and Face Place through a mutual friend. We spoke about my concerns and she analyzed my skin. She noted I had rosacea tendencies and recommended an excellent customized home care regimen and treatment plan. She introduced dermaplaning to me and I cannot even begin to explain the progressive improvement of my skin issues has been amazing!!!' I don't wear foundation any more and I feel prettier and more confident than I have in years!!I am hooked on FACE PLACE!!!Thank you, Donna!!
5	Today I had the opportunity to experience a fabulous facial by Donna Feldman.  This is a top notch treatment room. I also received eyelash extensions by Alex.  I have never had them before and they feel so natural. It was very relaxing experience. After my facial they offered a complimentary make up application. So I was able to go one with the rest of my day. I highly recommend this place.
5	Donna did an amazing job derma-planing my skin.  Loved the results.  Glowing and youthful!  Very professional.
5	I enjoyed my facial treatment at this place. Very relaxing and calming. Most importantly, the lady who worked with me is very knowledgable about skin and was also willing to personalize my skin care.
