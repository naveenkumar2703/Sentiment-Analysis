4	Newly remodeled. Several pumps.
4	This location has been around for many many years. I've gotten gas here many times. Surprisingly, I do not get harassed by homeless types (I say types, because nowadays there are tons of people posing as "homeless" but they just want to scam us) while pumping gas. I use the 'pay at the pump' option. There is a convenience mart too.  Convenient location at the corner of Rancho and Charleston, not too far away from UMC and other area medical offices.
3	Gas is gas but its not Costco
3	Its a gas station with a store, like so many gas stations today.   (I still laugh at the mini gas station Albertsons i saw that was in the shadow of a full fledged Albertsons.  C'mon- are we that lazy?)Anyway, used my Von's card points and saved 20 cents per gallon. The employees were very nice and entered my card infotainment the register for me because the card no longer swipes.
