3	3 stars. I had discovered the Tri-cycle place before and liked it. Good range of kit for triathletes - bike and swim stuff, running kit, gloves and socks so a good, wide range of tempting goodies.Its now had a refit and is really aiming for the biking market. High end bikes, clothing and accessories. Seemed a bit same-y to be honest as Ronde in Stockbridge does this better. There is even coffee on site (yep, same as Ronde but without the cosy, cafe feel). I did pick up some muscle rub here as it is needed but there wasn't much else to tempt me. Hell, after visiting Ronde, I wanted a bike and all the kit, even if I lacked the cash but I think Planet X is for the boys, not me...
2	This bike shop does pretty much everything possible to make the shopping experience intimidating for anyone other than a competitive cyclist or serious uber-bike-geek. Two grand bikes at the front door. Upon arrival at the front of the shop I got the opportunity to overhear staff members talking bike porn, recovery times and various other lycra-tinged conversation topics. Snore.   Only one brand is available here - Planet X. The offering for females is absolutely dismal. There was one female-cut merino racing jersey. That' it. The shop is over two floors for goodness sake!
2	Its always nice with new cycle stores, but I think this store can do much better if they want to show planet X.I was relly bored walkong through the store.
