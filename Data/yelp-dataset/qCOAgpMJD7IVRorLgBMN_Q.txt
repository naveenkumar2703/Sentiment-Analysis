5	Creative U is a terrific place to let out that pent-up creative energy in new and exciting projects.  I have taken classes on fused glass and metal working and really enjoy the instructors and the finished product when I'm done.  The studio time is affordable and the welcome is always warm.   I have definitely ramped up my creativity being at Creative U.  I live in Glendale so it is a ways for me to go but it is always worth it.   I learn something every time I step through the door.  Go visit Kathy and Jen and tell them I sent you!
4	I just got back to Gold Canyon from taking 3 classes at Creative U in Cave Creek, which in itself is a fabulous place to visit.It was a wonderful experience to be in the company of so many creative jewelry artists in a studio setting and what a friendly place... with so much going on. Even though I was the only person signing up for 2 classes, they were not cancelled.In fact I ended up with a private lesson from Denise. This was impressive and she was great, not to mention watching the glass fusing going on beside my jewelry classes...people making huge platters and dishes in multi color fused glass.I believe that if you have an open mind, you can always learn and the exchange of valuable information & inspiration between artists is something that spurs one on.Jenn's intricate creations were awesome and I say a big wow! If I had one criticism to make it would be to offer more advanced classes..However i will be back for more whether it be studio time or private instruction..i loved it !
