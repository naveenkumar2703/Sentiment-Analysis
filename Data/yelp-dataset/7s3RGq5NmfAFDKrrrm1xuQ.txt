2	The "conservative" newspaper in a town where a Republican hasn't been mayor since the 1930s. The "Trib" as we call it, was based out of Greensburg and worked its way into Pittsburgh when the Pittsburgh Press was on strike. Since the Post Gazette was also printed by the Pittsburgh Press, both newspapers were absent in Pittsburgh during the strike in 1992Richard Mellon Scaife owns the Tribune Review, a known conservative, he pumps millions of dollars into the Trib to keep it afloat. During the newspaper strike of 1992, Scaife started printing the "Pittsburgh Tribune Review" as a way of bringing a conservative view to a city widely run by Democrats, after the strike, the Pittsburgh Post Gazette absorbed the Pittsburgh Press which would close its doors. Today Pittsburgh still has two daily papers with conflicting political views. In 2006 the Trib printed an evening edition of the Tribune Review called the Trib PM. It was a free publication widely distributed throughout the city in corner boxes, supermarkets, and convenience stored. It contained breaking news after the morning edition went to print, sports, comics, stock market news, the latest obituaries and want ads. The Trib PM quietly went away without fanfare in early 2011.
4	When you get a six month subscription that includes Thursday and Sunday papers, you can't really complain.  The Thursday edition includes the entertainment guide and also the department store ads for the coming weekend.  The Sunday edition is huge and includes the coupon section.  If you use the coupons, one trip to the grocery store can pay for the entire subscription.Overall a decent paper and worth the price when you get a subscription deal.
