5	The security of this community always takes great care of us. 24/7 patrolling our streets. The actual community center is located right next to the school. That's how you know even our kids are safe. And when you need help, they come right away! This entire neighborhood is peaceful and the people here are friendly. I love that there are trails that run in-between and all through out this neighborhood. and there's long roads instead of street patches. That way when the day comes for me to finally wake up early enough, I can actually jog. If I'd want to live anywhere in Summerlin, it would be right here in this neighborhood. It's right in the heart of everything good in Summerlin.
