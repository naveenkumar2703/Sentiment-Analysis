3	This place has gone from one venue to another to another only in the last few years. Now, it's the GRV and has been so for the last couple of years. They hold a variety of events, one of them being a poetry reading that happens monthly. But the first event that ever got me there was a solstice, where there were a variety of live acts and acro, all in a fundraising tactic for the Beltane Fire Festival.I remember enjoying the live music, but being extremely disappointed at 1) the beers, 2) the prices of said beers, and 3) the entry price. Also, it was so incredibly muggy in there (and it shouldn't have been considering it was pretty much still winter) that I had to go out to the filthy staircase outside as a breather every half hour or so. I say filthy staircase lightly, but do genuinely mean it: it's where people between the Cowgate and Chamber Street go to pee. And it stinks so bad. Hitch up your trousers, ladies and gents, if you fancy going along those. I've never been back to the GRV. I've tried, but they keep trying to get me to pay 10 pounds to get in. What.
