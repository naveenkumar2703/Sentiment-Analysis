3	This is a drinkers bar. It's got plenty of TVs, a juke box, Golden Tee machines, pool tables and some couches to relax on to watch the games. NY Yankee fans will give this place 8 stars. No food here so I gave it 3.
3	Hole in the wall... but cool.  I was there years ago and watched some of the best local musicians jam.  It was incredible.  I hear they still like to drop in but when I was there it was quiet.  Just a quick stop to see what's new.  Reasonably comfortable, gambling (video poker/keno), etc.
2	Not a fan.They had a karaoke night for a short time about a year or two ago, but every time the owner was in, the host had to turn the music down...almost to the point of not needing a microphone.if you want a quiet bar, don't have a karaoke night.I love dive bars, but this place was just seedy.
5	Ohhhh boi!  If you like blues, this is a fabulous blues spot on Sat.  It's a hole in the wall.  But one of the guys use to write and sing with Bobby Blue Bland!  And I love me some Bobby Blue Bland!  The drinks are affordable, and the crowd is a more mature crowd!  The waitress was cool!  I will be back!  To hear some down home, southern soul blues! Starts at 8:30 p.m to 2;00 a.m.
