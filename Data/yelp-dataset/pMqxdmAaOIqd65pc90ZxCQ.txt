4	i will grant that it has been almost 4 years since i've been here, but given that it's a teeny family-owned family-run sandwich shop that i ate at most days over the course of a month, i thought it was a shame no one had reviewed the place yet!located underneath an apartment complex in waunakee, this little deli shop is tucked away.  as i stayed in the apartment complex above it, however, their location was ideal for me.their sandwiches never ceased to disappoint.  now i'm a really picky eater -  not particularly a condiment person, won't mix milk with meat, don't eat pig, so when it comes to getting sandwiches the way i want them i'm usually SOL.  fortunately, tho, at deli delicious, they make sandwiches just like they would at subway so you get precisely what you want, except 1) the food is fresher 2) it's on bread instead of subs, and 3) you're supporting local business instead of national chains.  if memory serves me right, their chips were also super addicting.  the price was always decently low, too - at least low enough to support my habit.don't know when, if ever, i'll get back to waunakee, wi, but i know that if i do, i'm definitely stopping at deli delicious!
4	What a pleasant surprise.  I have driven by this place but never knew it really existed.The food is very good. Fresh, made to order, nice variety, main courses are great, sandwiches good, sides also good.Ordered the fish fry, its Wisconsin, ya betcha, and it was very good.  The fish was tasty and reasonable.  Mom had baked potato which was very good and I had the fries which were good.Customer Service was very friendly.  They seemed to have a pretty good take out business on Friday for their Fish which was nice to see.Keep up the great work.I will definitely be back,  thanks!
