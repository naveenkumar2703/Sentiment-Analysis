5	I am always nervous to take a computer in to be fixed. But Pat and his crack geek squad took my sad several years old Dell 1520 Inspiron laptop to better than new status. Mine died but I had no idea why. They ran it thru the paces and turns out the old hard drive had crashed. They gave me all the options, explained everything along the way, gave me the straight up talk with all costs, etc. I chose....and chose wisely. New hard drive is better in every way and this old pooter is like new again and has never run better or faster. Thanks again to everyone there!
5	Came here with my friend who was having problems with his laptop and they give a free 15 minute diagnosis.  The guys there were great and spent plenty of time making sure everything was okay on his computer and after testing it and finding nothing wrong.  He suggested the problem was probably internet related with my friends home service.  Turns out he was right and it cost us nothing which is way to generous in my opinion.  I had to come on here and Yelp about it.  The place isn't fancy and is in front of the bowling alley on the NE corner of 35ave & Union inside the strip mall.  Check it out if you have a chance and skip the Geek Squad!
5	I brought my laptop here a week or so ago due to some problems.  They do a free (yes free) 15 minute diagnostic, and he found the problem after some work.  He tried a right-there fix, which would have been a small fee if successful, but I had to leave it, it needed some work.  It was ready as promised when promised and the $119 was $80 less than (B*** B***) wanted just to look at it.  I am very happy with the service and will go back anytime I do something dump to my computer.
1	i had a terrible experience here.i'd go into detail about exactly what happened, but they have my personal information, and that honestly makes me feel uncomfortable.i would not recommend this computer store. at all.
