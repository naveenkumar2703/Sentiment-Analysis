2	While this is the closest Goodwill to me, it is by far not one that I enjoy going in to.  It's pretty small and not really well-kept the way others I've been to are.  Not much of a selection either...so I'll stick to some of the other Goodwills around the valley.  Although, when we moved and brought over about 4 different carloads of stuff to donate, the line was super long.  The guys in the back were pretty awesome and hilarious though and very helpful, so there's that.
4	Its a GoodWill in Goodyear the stuff is not as good as if you went to a GoodWill in a richer part of the valley but it is good
5	We have dropped off donations multiple times over the past month. Every time we come here the staff is always in a great mood. We never have to wait as they are out as soon as you pull up every single time.
4	Love the drive up & drop off donations for patrons.
3	Nice location!!!! I didn't find anything that I really needed but they had a good amount of items and the prices were okay too.
