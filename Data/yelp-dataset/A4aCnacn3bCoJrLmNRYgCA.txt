5	Excellent. Reliable. Professional.
5	I was very pleased with the work Rich did for me! I needed to have a coax cable rerouted in my house and Cox was unable to do it, so a friend referred me to Rich. He came out right away, got the cable I needed and set it up no problem. I really appreciated how much time he spent explaining things to me. I definitely plan to call him again!
5	We had to have our patio roof replaced. These guys did excellent work, quick turn around, great price quote and very professional. We are very please with the work completed and will be using them in the future!
