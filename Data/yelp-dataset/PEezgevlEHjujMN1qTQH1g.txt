5	Caribbean-themed restaurant with a laid-back atmosphere. We all -- Mom, Dad, big kids, little kids -- all really like this food!Some suggestions: Coconut Shrimp, Jerk Chicken Pasta, Grilled Steak Kabobs, Ribs with Guava BBQ sauce, Calypso Shrimp Linguine, Jerk salmon w/ mashed sweet potatoes 'n plantains... Mmmm...Save room for the homemade Key Lime Pie or Pinacolada bread pudding!
1	The coconut shrimp is tasty.  The tuna salad is really good.  However, most of the menu can be acquired at Red Lobster for about the same price and even better quality.  There is virtually nothing on the menu for a vegetarian.  I would not recommend this place to someone craving seafood, as the quality and freshness are questionable.  Go to Red Lobster instead!
4	TOO BAD IT'S CLOSED!  Best Lemonade Around!  I weep for their fresh squeezed lemonade made with sugar cane syrup with sugar cane sticks to chew on.  (And they would bring you a 'side shaker' full of extra - like when you get a really good milkshake at a soda fountain!)  I used to love the Cuban sandwich, even though it made you feel like you needed a nap afterwards!  Why they got rid of this chain when there is such CRAP around here that should close down is beyond me...
