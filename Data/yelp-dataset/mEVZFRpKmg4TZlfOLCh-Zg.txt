1	I found the staff to be hurried and not wanting to take the time to listen. Dr. Darson's physician's assistant was extremely apathetic and rough. Disregarded my pain.While my experience with the doctor himself was not negative during the visit, the follow up, especially in addressing my pain was nil. Also he seems very busy and hurried.I will be looking for a new doctor.
5	It took about 25 minutes to fill out the "new"  patient forms, very comprehensive, good stuff!  The front desk was efficient and helpful.  Waited an additional (post form fill out) 10 minutes to be called back.  The doctors assistant was somewhat brisk but friendly.  Waited an additional 4 or 5 minutes until Dr. Darson came in.  Nice bedside manner, came across as interested and listened well.  He never appeared to be in a hurry and spent about 3/4 hour with me.  I found him to be empathetic, friendly and interested in what I had to say.  he set up two follow up appointments and will do some testing followed by a CT scan with contrast and another appointment.  I got the feeling he knew what he was doing and I felt more optimistic.  Good Doc!!!
1	Dr. Darson's medical assistant presents as being rushed and bored with his part of the exam.  My experience with Dr. Darson is he orders unnecessary testing.  Never really fully explains the results and I concluded my experience with Dr. Darson having more problems than I initially went in to see him for in the beginning.  He always seems hurried and I am presently looking for another physician.  I would take a pass on Dr. Darson.
