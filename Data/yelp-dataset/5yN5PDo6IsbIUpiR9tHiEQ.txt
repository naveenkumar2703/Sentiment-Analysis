4	Just brought my pup Roi to get neutered. The staff was pretty good, they treated my dog with care and I think they did everything pretty quickly, drop off at 7:30am and pick up at 3:00. They did kinda try to upsell a bunch of stuff that kinda sounds like your dog is going to die if you don't but that's just the way it goes now-a-days. The Vet himself was kinda dry and a little short with words, but I didn't have many questions, the vet techs were very friendly and informative. My cat is due for a checkup soon so I may be using their services again shortly, because I was please with my visit, and Roi has been doing great since the surgery, healed quickly and never winced in pain.
