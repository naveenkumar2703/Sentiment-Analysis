1	Called requesting a packet of information in order to hire one their models for regular fashion shoots. They never sent it. The impression I was given is that I am a waste of time because I do not have billions of dollars.  Guess what?  My money spends just the same as any wealthy client you have.Way to screw the start-up.  Great job, guys.
5	Sharing some love for the Agency AZ... I've worked with this boutique model and talent agency since day 1. Their talent and team is stellar. As a photographer and makeup artist, I work with their new and seasoned talent on a regular basis. Whether it be a test shoot or client booking.Terri, Margaret and the team have always taken care of each booking professionally and with care to detail. Because of this fact, I refer clients and new talent too them often. They have built a strong community of talent for fashion and commercial work in Arizona. It has been a pleasure to see the agency grow to where they are today...on TOP. So if you are in need for professional talent of all ages, this is the place.
5	I must start off by saying, I have never booked talent through an agency before and it was a little intimidating. Ginger from The Agency Arizona was so helpful and profession and made the process easy. I am the Vice President of the National Concierge Association (NCA) Nevada Chapter and I needed to hire two models to dress as show girls for the NCA's big gala in Carefree, AZ. The price was the best I could find and the models suggested were beautiful and perfect for the job. The two models we hired were Brianna and McKenna and although there was a small wardrobe snafu, the girls pulled through. I highly recommend the Agency Arizona and again want to thank Ginger, Brianna and McKenna for their professionalism. I would definitely use them again.
