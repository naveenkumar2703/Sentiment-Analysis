3	I'm okay with Baja Fresh, but I don't go very often.I appreciate the salsa is fresh and kept clean. I like that the food is fresh and doesn't make me feel like I'm gonna have cardiac arrest.I tend to like Burrito Bowls and I thought it's rather weird they charge you to "upgrade" it.....Uh, you saved a tortilla by puting it in a container, isn't that not a "downgrade" ? I would think they wouldn't charge you $1.50 to do that. It has the same amount of food in the bowl as a burrito so you didn't really get more for the price which I initially thought was the price difference. Seriously- unwrap one and throw it in a bowl and see. Sure, they add lettuce, but it's not even much. Only other "upgrade" available- enchilada/wet style burrito....that makes sense since you're gaining sauce and cheese. I guess make bowls at Chipotle, do a burrito at Baja.  I know, it's a small thing, but it's rather weird to me!
3	I don't come here often, but when I do I order their Chicken Nachos.  As I've mentioned before, after I realized how many calories are in one of these bad boys (2,020 calories!), I reduced the number of visits to Baja Fresh.  That's 3 hours on the Elliptical for me!This location is convenient because it's in a shopping center with Walmart & Sam's Club nearby.....which are 2 places I frequent.  Of course, their signature Salsa Bar and plenty of seating is available.Will I return?  When I'm in the mood to gain some poundage, I'll stop by.
2	Normally love Baja, but this one has been very disappointing. Shrimp tacos, taste like rubber. All but one salsa was worth eating. Beans are a no go, and rice was average. My suggestion, don't let this be your first experience a Baja Fresh, go to another location, they do have good food!
