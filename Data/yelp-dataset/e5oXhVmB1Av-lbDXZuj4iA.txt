1	I had a warranty repair on my Toshiba laptop.  It failed to come on.  Wouldn't boot at all.  I take it to CS&S and after a *MONTH* of having it, I call to check status and they say, "We've put in two new motherboards and neither work.  We think its your operating system".  They call me later that day to tell me to come pick it up.  I go down and they say "We tried it with a different hard drive with Windows XP and it works.  We see you have Windows 7...we don't support that.  You'll have to fix it yourself.sigh.  So.  I take it home, see that it won't update--I do some Bing and Google and find the problem.  Apply the fix from the blogs, and guess what?  Problem fixed!  Took me all of 30 minutes.  What a bunch of no-good incompetent HACKS!  Never take something in there!  EVER!
3	This is in response to Rick T's review.I work as a tech in another company that also deals with warranty issues.  CSS did the right thing as software is never covered by any computer manufacturer.  CSS tried to fix any hardware-related issues and that's what they did: No hardware isssues found.  Rick T had a software problem and that was not covered under any circumstances.  Also, Windows 7 came out in October, 2009, so Rick T's Win7 version was likely a Beta version that could have problems.  People need to understand what warranties entail before they lash out and be unreasonable.
1	These people are Horrible to get ahold of, I had an issue with a firewall they sold me, which I had right during audit time and they took forever to get back to me. They sent a technician out he worked on it said he had it running but then it wasn't working the next day. Do not do business with these people!
