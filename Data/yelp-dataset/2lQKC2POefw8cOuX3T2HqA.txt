3	OMG It's a bank! Bank of America may be a terrible bank but the tellers at this location are proficient at their jobs and the lines aren't too terrible. Not to mention there are some cute employees which make my pants more than a bit happy.The parking lot here is complete and utter madness which life tilts the crap out of me and getting in and out of the drive-thru during business hours is a bit difficult.
4	Service: Their service here is great. I'm a regular here and I really appreciate how they remember my name. They're really nice and they also offer more accounts and etc to up sale. Thank god they don't do that to me anymore because it started to get annoying lol Location: This Bank of America is close to street in the parking lot. The drive through ATM is kind of hard to get into when your coming in from the street. Be careful in this parking lot people drive like nuts!
4	I love that this location is right off the freeway so it is easy off, easy on.  I have to say that I have never been inside.  So I can only say that the times that I have been here there has been no line for the ATM, they are always in working order and the area is always clean. The turn to get to the ATM can be a little strange if you are entering on the Rainbow side of the building. You almost have to drive in and then make a U-Turn, unless there are no cars in the parking lot.
1	Get more Tellers. I do not want to spend my entire lunch hour waiting in line. Busy afternoon 2 tellers.
1	6 bucks to cash my check. Sorry if that was a little shocking but nothing says scumbag like going into a bank of America if you ask me. I very politely told the lady that I was now less inclined to open up the checking account that she was trying to push on me after learning that I have to pay $6 to cash my check, but as I was giving this opinion she argued with me vehemently that I should just open the account because everyone else does the same thing. Do they? I guess I'm old school whatever.
