3	This is a Dairy Queen like all the rest.  Good stuff but it HAS NO DRIVE THRU!  A Dairy Queen w/o a drivethru is almost as bad as a DQ w/o ice cream.  Seriously!  Whaaa waaa waaa.  It's stupid.Otherwise it's just like any othe DQ. It's friggin busy most evenings, especially after dinner.  I'd give it 4 or 5 stars but once we rolled up on the store 5-10 minutes before closing and they had the door locked.  KIDS!  It sucks being denied ice cream.  Maybe I should give them 2 stars.  Nah... most the time its a regular 'ol DQ.
3	Solid DQ. Had a delicious blizzard served by a pleasant counter person. No reason not to enjoy a little soft serve deliciousness here!
4	This place is a nice one to come and get ice cream with the family.  Clean and always good service.  My girls love their ice cream!!!!
