5	Great friendly service
1	I called Joey and set up for him to come over for a bid.  20 minutes after he was supposed to be here, I called and left him a message.  10 minutes after that he called and said he forgot to call me earlier and would not be able to make it and rescheduled.  Now it is 55 minutes after he was supposed to be here, I have called and left him a message with no response.  This does not bode well...  Would not recommend this contractor if you value timely responses or dependability.
5	I have had Slade landscape do my maintenance for 2 years now and do An exceptional job and always are willing to take care on anything I need done.
5	Great Work and Great People!!!
