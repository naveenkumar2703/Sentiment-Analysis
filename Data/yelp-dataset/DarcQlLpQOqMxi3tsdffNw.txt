5	I decided to stop by this hot dog stand one late night and I have to say it was an amazing decision.  El Goloso hot dogs offer "Sonoran style hot dogs", which before this night I had no idea what such hot dog was.  It's a complicated mess.  An all beef frank wrapped with bacon in a sweet and soft hot dog bun. Ingredients added; beans, grilled onions, ketchup, mayo, mustard, guacamole, hot sauce, and cheese. Just made myself hungry writing this review.Strongly recommend this hot dog stand. Friendly family operated. The cook there has to be the friendliest person ever!!!   (19th ave and Peoria on the Northwest corner)
5	El Goloso hot dogs has the most delicious bacon wrapped hot dogs in AZ!!! I've tried many other hot dog stands and none compare. The few other stands I've tried these "dangerous" hot dogs don't have the right combination.  If the bread is amazing the bacon wrapped frank taste old and just wrong because they have them sitting in the steamer or vice versa. Another great thing about this stand is the available options for Mexican bottle sodas. They offer many options for cokes; cans, bottle and even a larger Mexican bottle. For a small stand this place packs the perfect punch! :)   Strongly recommend...
