3	Satisfied my husband's cigar craving on a Friday night. Will say if you blink, you'll miss it! Not actually in the plaza, but a stand-alone building next to Main St.
4	Well, as soon as I got in, lady check on my ID since I look under 25 lol. Smells smoke as soon as you open the door (expect that!) the sales lady was helpful. She showed me few sample and even open the whole cabinet for hookah stuff. There's also few table if you ever wanna do a hookah session inside, of course it cost some molah. All over experience was great and very convenient.
2	Sometimes I don't like to go in because it seems dirty and some of the staff looked real tweaked.  Kind of a nice humidor but don't expect real knowledgeable staff to be of any assistance.  I think a raid of this place would turn up some  unmentionables.  Proceed with a bit of caution
