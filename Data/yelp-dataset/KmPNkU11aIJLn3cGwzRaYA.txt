3	When I first called this place to make an appointment the lady that answered the phone was very nice, and very kindly answered the questions that I had.When I arrived at happy nails one of the ladies quickly began to work. We sat there a little less than a hour (I was getting acrylics). During that time I was sitting there I was looking around at the place around me  it was very clean and had thier permits properly shown. When she was all finished I was impressed by the handiwork at quick glance. I left the place and further inspected my nails, and I noticed that a couple nails were crooked, and that there were gaps between the nail bed and the acrylic nail, this I was not too happy about because stuff like that can often lead to bacteria growing on the nail. I can see why that they off their nails for a cheaper price, you truly get what you pay for. Just getting polish is no issue they did an excellent job on my friends nails who was with me at the same time as me.
1	Went in today for a gel mani it wasn't good the paint job was the worst I'd ever had anywhere, I'm not the type of person who complains so I just paid and left and won't be back, when someone takes almost and hour and a half you'd think it be perfect but I can paint my own nails better, I'll stick to fancy nails they are cheaper and do a better job, only tried this place cause at fancy nails my gel polish doesn't even make it a week and a half at my old salon I'd have it on for like four weeks!
