3	3.5 starsFinally got to visit this city of Phoenix, when all the other times we both would only be in the city because of the airport. Our friend took us to Phoenix to grab brunch before our trip back and pretty much drove us around Downtown Phoenix. It pretty much reminds me of Downtown Los Angeles. A few ghetto places and a few nice places. I thought there wouldn't be homeless people, but I guess I was wrong. There's always going to be at least 1% of them here and there. There's a few one way streets, so be careful when you're driving. ALSO be careful with drivers, some may look like tourist and will not look at traffic while busy looking at something else. Drove passed Downtown Civic Space Park - http://www.yelp.com/biz/downtown-civic-space-park-phoenixLooked pretty cool. Try coming here at night time, the lit up loop will most likely amaze you like it would with me even when it wasn't even lit in colors :D I just can't wait to check it out the next time I visit!
5	Phoenix is a one of a kind city, that is beautiful, fashionable, BIG, and luxurious. :-)
5	I adore this city and would move here in a heartbeat. It is a foodie's dream, hiking is fabulous, Spring Training is fun even for the non-baseball inspired and the views are breathtaking.
