5	Great meat counter for Beef, Pork and deli meats. solid produce, bulk nuts and dried fruits, and spices sections for a corner store. support this place. The've been open for 25+ years supporting local farmers and the community.
5	As a former employee (8 years) back when Joe H. owned it and Larry taught me to butcher, it warms my heart that this place is still in existence (I still have my Jay Rath designed butcher paper window sale signs from my last week working there).  I grew up buying mainly candy, but occasionally milk, and eggs for my mother as one of the neighborhood kids/'weasels'.  Great store, great neighborhood.  Best homemade brats in the universe, excellent deli, nice people have always run the place.  I've been/lived all over the United States now, there really isn't a better place to buy the basics than the Regent Food Market, "Joes", "The Little Store".  It is a slice of Americana that doesn't exist much anymore.  Keep up the great work to everyone that is keeping it ALIVE, goodonya.
4	What a nice little co-op market! It's small but it has all the basics and a great meat market in back. All local sourced, if possible, otherwise what you'd expect from a good co-op. They even carried a few varieties of Theo Chocolate. If you're a member of Willy Street Co-op, your card is good here so, check it out!
4	Yeah, this place is about the size of a postage stamp, but considering their size, they pack a LOT in there! It's a neighborhood store, but their nice selection of everyday items, organic, special diet-friendly foods, produce, full meat counter, small bulk section, and impressive freezer selection are probably why they've been open for 90+ years. Even if the selection is not huge, they have almost one of everything.In the center of the store there's a section which features locally produced products (one or two I haven't seen at Willy Street). The staff is always super friendly. Regent Market Co-op is the bomb!
