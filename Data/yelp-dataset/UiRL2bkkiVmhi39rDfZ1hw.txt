4	While it is odd to bank in a location that I had previously ate and drank at (Chili's) this location is bright, and well staffed. This branch is most convenient for me during lunch hours, and I am always in and out within moments, leaving me plenty of time to eat and get back to work.
4	Convenient location. As mos t banks, avoid during payday fridays during lunch and around rush hour or you will be stuck !
4	they had money in the 24hr ATMs. always good. card activated on the door entrance during non-business hours. easy location on Decatur, about 2 miles east of flamingo.
3	This isn't my favorite location. Why? The location itself is RIGHT by a bus stop so there are often a TON of people in the parking lot waiting for the bus. It often is hard to find parking.Today's visit was fine and uneventful minus a crack-head looking chick hanging out begging for $$, but the last time I was there a scary looking guy noticed me and followed me to my car trying to sell me knock off perfumes. I personally like to deposit cash when I am at the bank, so the last thing I want to do when going to the bank is worry about getting robbed in the parking lot. I think this location could use a security guard to make patrons feel safer bringing cash. Why 3 stars?? Although I would prefer not to bank at this location, I find the staff very sweet and helpful. The line is never too long and the tellers are fast.
1	This bank has the slowest most incompetent staff, all I wanted was a money order this process took them about 30 minutes to execute. I would rather drive across town to a branch who can execute simple tasks efficiently and promptly. You would think since they are so busy they would hire more competent people! So frustrating!
