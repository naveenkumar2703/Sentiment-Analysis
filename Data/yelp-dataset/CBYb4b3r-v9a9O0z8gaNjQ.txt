4	If you live here in Phoenix and need to rent a car to drive to, say, California, to get out of Phoenix, it's not as easy and you would think to find an off-airport car rental.  Or a place in the wasteland that is the near west side, where I live.I was surprised to find a Hertz office at 44th Avenue and Glendale (the address listed on Yelp is their old one).  (And VERY surprised to find they were the cheapest).   Chuck was the employee who assisted me and was very pleasant.  Got my car and headed to the coast.  This Hertz office rocks.  Go rent a car.
1	Avoid this Hertz at all costs.  This used to be a good place to rent a car, but it has gone downhill lately.  We did not receive the mid-sized SUV we reserved for use over the Fourth of July weekend.  We showed up at Hertz to find the place overrun with people waiting for cars they had reserved but were not there.  The guy at the counter (wearing sunglasses the whole time) just said that it was a busy day and that there was nothing he could do about it.  I told him that we were counting on having an SUV for the weekend and he just said sorry.  We walked out with a Mazda 5 but only because the couple ahead of us didn't want it.  Otherwise, we wouldn't have had a car and wouldn't have been able to go out of town. One person working there told us that Hertz books cars they don't have all the time.  On second thought - - maybe avoid Hertz as a company altogether...
