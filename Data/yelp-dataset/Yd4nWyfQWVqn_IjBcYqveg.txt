4	They always have a pepperoni Hot & Ready! Sometimes they are burnt though, so make sure you check out your pizza before you leave!
2	I was looking for something quick & cheap for lunch today. I saw a sign for Little Caeser's & stopped inside. I got a large hot & ready pepperoni pizza with an order of crazy bread & dipping sauce for only $8. The pizza wasn't bad, I've definitely had worse. The crazy bread was awesome. I'd come here again for lunch if I was in a hurry & didn't want to spend much.
4	Strange, as a kid for I remember that I did not like the pizza they have. So for the last, say 15 years I avoided them. Well, for what ever reason I decide to get a pizza from them. And I was surprised.  The pizza was good. I did not have their deep dish as, in general I don't like thick crust, but what I did have was wonderfully good. And I will be eating more here.
4	Scummy area that smacks of bad news, but the staff has remarkable work ethic and the pizza is predictably good. I dig the crazy bread best. I would like to try the deep dish sometime. The gal working the register exchanged some small talk about hair dye and was really personable. The pizza and breadsticks didn't take long, and was the usual greasy + tasty combo I expect at Little Caesar's.
