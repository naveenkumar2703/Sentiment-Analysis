5	Based on my last visit this store gets a 5 star rating from me... They were on their game!!! Awesome service, great attitudes and wonderful people..... I would return based on my last visit.... I have been to this location before but it has been some time.... Definitely a big change... Restaurant was clean and service was great... I have 3 boys and one of my biggest pet peeves is when the waitress/waiter brings me or other adults at the table food before the kids because by the time they get theirs they have already eaten half of mine... Not this time... Our waitress even came over when she saw the kids getting antsy with some crackers and their sides so they didn't drive me nuts...
5	Clean, great service, great smiles, and the cooks know when it's time to take it off the grill... Eating breakfast starting my Saturday with a great Denny's start thank you.
5	This American chain actually has veggie burgers!! Really!! This location is a nice place too because of all the diner charm.
4	Eating at this Denny's  I receive friendly staff greetings    I have not yet had a bad plate of food. My sever to day greatest me and know exactly what I drink even before i got to my table.   The staff checks on us not to fast or take to long before returning.
2	After my fiasco at the Denny's down the street (112th Avenue & Grand), we drove here. This Denny's was alright. The staff were friendly; the food was good; and the price is what you'd expect. Again, this place was dusty on the inside. Moreover, my wife sat in a booth where there was a piece of cushion missing. The "stuff" inside there was disgusting. All in all, you get what you pay for. It's a lot better than the Denny's down the road (which I would avoid like the plague), but that really isn't saying much.
