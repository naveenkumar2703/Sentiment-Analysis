3	My fiance and I tried to go here last night at 7pm when we couldn't decided after over an hour of what to have for dinner.  We waited for about 5 minutes for the hostess to acknowledge us and take down the info.  She was up at the station getting menus and taking them to another part of the restaurant and then coming back with them and still sort of ignoring us.  It was irritating.  There were two other groups in the lobby area with about 5-6 people each.  The hostess told us it would be 40 minutes.  She said they had plenty of tables open, but hardly any servers.  We decided to leave and go elsewhere.  I'll update after we actually make it past the lame teenage hostess in less than 40 minutes.  Hopefully they'll get some waitstaff by then...Update:I did manage to get seated and eat a meal here.  The deep fried mushrooms were great and very tasty.  The service was mediocre at best.  The actual waiter that was waiting our table didn't actually come to our table until the end of our meal.  We had the manager and another person waiting our table.  The steak I had was overcooked and not that great.  Our waiter did offer to bring our another, but I wasn't going to go through all of that at this point.  He did manage to give us some free appetizer coupons and I think he got a little bit taken off of the bill.  Pretty good for a guy who was never at our table.  It wasn't his fault, but he did his best to make it up.  Kudos to him - we gave him a decent tip just for that.  Next time I think I'll stick to a BBQ sandwich.  I'll up it from 2 to 3 stars.Second Update:We gave it another shot with our free appetizer coupons and had a much better experience.  They had a great seasonal beer and my pulled pork sandwich was delicious.  I think I had a few crazy experiences here, but if I sit inside at a non-crazy time, it should be okay.  It's not outta-this-world, but some decent BBQ in an area with limited options.
