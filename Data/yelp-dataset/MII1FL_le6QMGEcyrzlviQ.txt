4	This is my Walgreens of choice based on their location, hours, and pharmacy. It's nearby and they are open 24 hours. The pharmacists have always been helpful and they have yet to mess up my prescriptions (other Walgreens in the area have given me nothing but problems when it comes to generics and billing). The only thing that creeps me out a bit about this location is the employee who is always picking ice off the freezer items.. and eating it! LOL, I don't come for the food anyway so it's quite alright if not amusing. :-)
1	Emily the pharmacist was a very rude person. No help at all and acted as if my sick two year old was not worth her time to help us get our prescription. How she has a job is shocking to me, horrible customer service. She wouldn't even come back to the window to help us but didn't mind putting in her 2 cents to the other girl  about 30 ft away from the window she refused to come back and help us because she knew she was wrong to talk to us the way she did. She even flipped her name tag around so we couldn't read her name. Thank you Stephanie for helping us,that's all we could ask for.
