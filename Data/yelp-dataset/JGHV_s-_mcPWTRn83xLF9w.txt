1	The employees are rude and not at all helpful. I went in looking for a particular item. There were no customers in there except me. They ignored me until I asked for help and than they looked annoyed like it was a big hassle to help me out. They acted very snobbish. I will never go back.
5	Unlike the other reviewer, I found the employees here to be very friendly and helpful.  When I came in for maternity clothes, there was one top that I really liked, but they didn't have my size, so the gal at the register very kindly ordered the top for me and had it shipped to my house.  (Shipping is free when they do that.)  And when I came in for nursing bras and tops, the gal that worked with me was very helpful with her recommendations on bra structure and her opinions on some of the tops.The clothes at this store are very reasonably priced, especially if you sign up on their mailing list and get their coupons via email.
4	All things for the mother to be.
