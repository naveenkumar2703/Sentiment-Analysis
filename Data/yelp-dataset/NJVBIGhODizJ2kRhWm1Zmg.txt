1	Did not have what I was looking for and weren't very helpful or friendly. Not a fan.
2	Freddie's Nutrition is my usual go-to store for protein bars and supplements. Stopped on the way out of LVAC and was disappointed to see their cost on quest bars was way higher than Freddie's. They also don't do discounts on mixed flavors of quest bars. Seemed annoyed when I asked. Will not be back.
1	How can I expect to get ripped like Arnold with the prices and selection that this these guys offer? While you're trying to max out in the gym these guys are maxing out their prices. Puny selection, weak customer service and pumped up prices.
