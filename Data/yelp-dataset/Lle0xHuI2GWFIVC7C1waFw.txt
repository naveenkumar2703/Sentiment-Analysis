4	Great for all the budding Andy Murrays out there , has numerous indoor and outdoor courts along with a gym which has fittness classes as well. Run by Edinburgh council so well run and reasonably priced.
4	I used to attend Craiglockhart Tennis & Sports Centre as a young, fit individual full of tennis promise. Ok, well maybe the majority of that sentence was slightly exaggerated, but I did used to be young. I do know this place very well though, having taken tennis lessons here while I was at school, and also having played in recent years in a few of the morning group sessions, for which you have to phone up in advance to book your place. I've never met a coach I didn't like in the years I've come along here to try and improve my mediocre tennis skills. Everyone working at the centre has always been really friendly and keen to make games and coaching fun, and not like a fitness obligation. The centre has 6 indoor courts, open all year, and 8 outdoor courts, open April to September. You can sign up for a coaching course, attend individual classes, book a lesson, or hire one of the courts and play a casual game with mates.
