5	Being from Santa Cruz (California not Arizona) we are a mecca for vegans which is nice when you want a change of pace... I know some of you may think it is blasphemy... no meat...but some of the vegan foods are super tasty (not to mention good for you). This brings me to Wei of Chocolate.... Not only is it really good vegan chocolate it also has a philosophy behind it of how to live a positive, healthy and well centered life. I dig company like this that have a strong message and send it through food. Their chocolate is made/themed for bringing peace, clarity, gratitude etc.  In using different percentages of cacao mixed with herbs or flower essences you have an amazing piece of chocolate.  (check out their website for more information)While at the Farmer's Market I sampled and decided on their limited edition chai bar. Eating a small square each day until it was finished I highly enjoyed the flavor and the few moments of enjoying it.  Not only did it taste like chocolate chai (which I love) but it being vegan= pure ingredients and none of the junky stuff.  If you are a junk food lover and could never image going vegan... give this company a try.. you might be surprised how good vegan food can be.
5	Their vegan dark chocolate is exceptional! I savor each piece and love to gift it (or receive it as a gift!) Wonderful special little chocolates anyone would adore. :c)
5	My boyfriend hunted down these tasty little chocolates for me on Valentine's Day. I have been wanting to try these local morsels for a while, especially since I recently became vegan. I believe they were a little on the pricey side... but completely worth it because a little goes a long way. We enjoyed the "Wei Relaxed" dark chocolate and the "All the Wei" dark chocolate collection which included chai, citrus, chili, espresso, and dark flavors. Check out the Wei of Chocolate Facebook page for a list of retailers that carry their products. Happy chocolate eating!
