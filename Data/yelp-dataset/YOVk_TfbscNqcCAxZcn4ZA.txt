5	I am so happy I came across Rebecca and Integrity All Star Realty!  Finding Rebecca and her team was a true blessing.  When the banks were screwing around with me she and her team helped to negotiate through a short sale.  A few years down the road, my new wife and I worked with her and James to purchase our current home that we love.  Rebecca, James, and the rest of the team were great to work with.  We are so happy we worked with them and highly recommend the team to anyone else!  This is one of the few companies that we've worked with in the Phoenix market that resulted in 100% satisfaction!
