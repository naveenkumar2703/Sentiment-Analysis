4	After going to the same nail tech for 12 years, we moved from Peoria to Fountain Hills.  I had to find someone in the neighborhood. Found Doreen at Go Divas. Lucky for me!  The shop was clean, people were friendly, and Doreen knows how to do nails. She listened to me and was meticulous. I booked my next appt before I left and hope to be a regular!
1	This is a nice salon, but I got a new operator and her operation on my hair ruined the couple of years that I have been growing it out.  She put odd layers all over my head that were choppy, not even and I could not style my hair at all.  I had to have it recut.  My trust is ruined.  I think this is the reason so many people just grow their hair and never have it styled cuz the style I got looked like a two year old cut my hair.  Beware!
