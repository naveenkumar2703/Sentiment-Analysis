5	the food was amazing and the ambiance exceptional! by far one of the best sushi joints in Vegas! The menu is simple and easy to read. The quality of the food makes up for the average sushi pricing. The service was great, and the sushi chefs were amazing! I will definitely come back to this place and recommend it to my friends and family!
5	Food was awesome, and service was great. New place always has a few kinks to work out, but this place is here for the long run. Definitely coming back.
5	My fiancee and I ate here back in June on my birthday. Every single part of my meal was exquisite and delicious. The ambiance was perfect. We were really lucky to find this place in Vegas. This is the best place to go for sushi in Vegas.
5	As a connoisseur of sushi throughout the world, I was blown away by the quality, presentation and over the top taste that I experienced at this restaurant. The artistic presentation of the sushi was the best I have seen anywhere as this is an art, not a science. I cannot recommend this restaurant more strongly and look forward to returning on my next trip back to Las Vegas.
5	Had an excellent time here...the food was wonderful and the staff very friendly and accommodating. Great atmosphere as well...will definitely visit again next time I'm in Vegas. Highly recommended, you won't be disappointed!
5	THE BEST! So good! A surprise! Who knew next to a strip club that such a great sushi restaurant would be found!?!
