3	Atkinson's is a pretty good spot to find some trinkets or other souvenirs.  There's the usual collection of junk but also some decent looking Southwestern jewelry.  The best deal are the handpainted ornaments for $4-5.
4	Great place to go when you need to find stuff for all the family back home. I found my usual shot glass and some other trinkets that everyone doesnt' really need :)Staff was helpful and chatty, which is always nice!
