4	I never expected to come here, but sometimes your kids will lead to you to all new places to write your Yelp reviews. . .My stepdaughter was looking for a blank skateboard deck to decorate and paint, and she knew about this place because her father went to school with the owner years ago.We looked around, got the deck, and received friendly service.  Cool shop.  Not really my thing, but if we want to get more skateboard stuff for my kid, I'll head here again.
