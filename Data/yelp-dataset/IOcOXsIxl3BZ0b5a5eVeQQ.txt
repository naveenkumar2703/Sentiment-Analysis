5	I got lucky choosing this shop, I've found!  I sustained $5000 damage to my 6-week-old Honda Civic after being hit from the rear .  I called the dealership who said this is the body shop they use.  Since then, I've found that I got lucky choosing them, rather than the 'recommended' body shop (Sterling) that my INSURANCE COMPANY OWNS (shouldn't that be illegal??!!).  Sterling tried to get them to straighten and reuse a side panel, which they would not do.  After 6 weeks, I have my car back, looking and driving good as new.  I've heard from others that they are one of the BEST in the Valley.  I highly recommend them.
4	had to have a little body work done after a knothead backed into me in a parking lot paul at body pro was easy to deal with and had work compleated on time to satisfaction
5	This place was great to us. When the insurance agent totaled our car, Body Pro explained what that meant--much better detail than what the insurance agent had. They explained the that there is difference in payout when you take a salvaged car as opposed to letting the insurance take the car. They were nice enough to fix the light in our car at a very, very reasonable price. I will go here again if the need arises.
5	I brought my BMW 750 LI in after an accident on the highway.  They were informative and did an excellent job repairing my car.  It was completed on time and I can't even tell is was in a wreck.  Thanks!
