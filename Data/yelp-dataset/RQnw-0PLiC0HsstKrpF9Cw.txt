3	They are right off the 10 and 51st ave. I've only gone here for drive thru while I'm on lunch at work. Been here a few times. The employees are really cheerful compared to other McDonalds I've been too. They are quite generous here with napkins and sauces lol. No complaints really. Free wifi is awesome too while waiting in line at the drive thru :p
5	McDonalds at this location donated the breakfast for "The Run for the Wall".  Check out www.rftw.org.  Thank you for your contribution to our nations Veterans!
3	Stopped in for lunch during work. Employees friendly. Restroom dirty and a homeless guy sleeping at one of booths under the tv.
1	As writing this still stuck in the drive thru. Been here for about 15 waiting & still haven't gotten my food. Only taking cash at the moment which sucks!!! Really bad service
