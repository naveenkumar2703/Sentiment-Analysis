5	What can you say, best ice cream close to my home & always consistently good.  This location is great also because it's a rocky mountain chocolate too, which means you can get all your sugar in one location, ha ha. It's clean & service is always great too, what else can I say....its good.
5	Delicious, as always! Took my daughter for the first time today! She's a big fan already!
5	You have to try the cake batter batter batter. My wife and I shared one after lunch and we were both like wow. It tastes like cake batter and like my wife said without the eggs. The service was great and they made it fast. A nice treat on a hot day.
5	Love this place! Mostly for the Rocky Mountain Chocolate part of the store. The apple pie covered apples are to die for.They are so friendly and give us fast service when we come here.
