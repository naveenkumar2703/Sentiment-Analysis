5	I have been a participant at several Livewire Karaoke events, vendor shows, fundraisers, etc. If you want your private party or event vamped up a notch in the "let's have fun" department...this is the way to do it!! Tina Reynolds with Livewire Karaoke brings the karaoke party to YOU. She has always been on time, if not early, to be fully prepared to start the party on time, to mix/mingle with participants and make everyone feel like they are the star on stage! There are NO bad singers with Tina as the KJ (Karaoke Jockey! I just learned that..!) She also has a darn good voice of her own to keep you entertained during the "lulls."With 18+ years of experience as a "Mobile KJ," Tina IS Livewire Karaoke!
5	Livewire Karaoke delivers the goods. Tina is a terrific "dj" with a huge library of songs, she entertains the crowd with her own great singing, and makes a dull party fun and alive. No more microphone cords to tie you to a stage, with her wireless mics you can act like a rock star! I'd hire her for my parties again!
5	Livewire Karaoke is totally awesome! I've attended at least 3 of her events, fundraisers etc and she has everything you need to have a fantastic time. She has hundreds of songs to choose from and makes you feel comfortable even if you are "microphone shy". I highly recommend Tina Reynolds for your next event.
