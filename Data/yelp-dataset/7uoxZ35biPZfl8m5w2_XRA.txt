4	Neighborhood delivery and takeout great....certainly a step higher than the other chains in this level.They don't biast 30
5	5-stars for Papa John's? Am I crazy?Yes. Probably.But it really is worth of the rating. Why?- So easy to order online; brilliantly intuitive and logical- The inside of the store is spotless - I've never seen it in disarray- Staff is friendly and efficient- Consistent quality; there's no hoping the pizza is as good as a previous time - it just is- Never greasy- Quite possibly the best "well done thin crust" pizza I've ever had in the Madison area. It holds-up without flopping over, even when piping hot, and it's always perfectly cooked, without being burned or overly charred. I'm not a fan of their commercials or PJ's personal philosophies. That said, I have yet to find a better thin crust in Madison. I'll keep looking, though.
1	Papa John's is great pizza! Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to get it delivered. After calling the store I was informed the front door of my residence was past the delivery boundary. My back door is adjacent to the street they deliver to. Didn't matter to the phone operator and never even considered finding a way to make it work. The employee's response, "the boundary has to be set somewhere" works in theory unfortunately this customer lives in reality. Really disappointed with the service being offered. I understand there are policies but being 20 feet past an arbitrary boundary is absurd. Thanks Papa!!
