5	Amazing new-ish cafe in the heart of Scottsdale. From the first moment I walked in the door, I felt like I was a "regular." The feel is trendy yet oh-so-comfortable. Not comfortable like a nasty old pair of sweats, But "cool"-comfortable like a pair of butter-soft Coach leather loafers. One of the coolest things in a restaurant oozing with cool is that all of the fruit, vegegables, coffee, and even the meat are all organic, and locally grown wherever possible. The menu ranges from as American as burgers and fries to pan-asian/exotic, such as Malaysian Seafood Curry or Japanese Pumpkin Ravioli.By-the-way, the owner is Tom Frank, was a one of the founders of P.F. Chang's

We looked over the menu and decided on the same entree which is unusual for us. (Of note- on the menu there is a section entitled "Pasta" which several Asian noodle dishes under it. I know its silly but it rubbed me the wrong way.) The calamari appetizer was average, nothing terribly special. We did not enjoy the marinara they serve it with; it was very sweet and it should have been more tomato-y.  But we did enjoy that the calamari was served Rhode Island style.  The gemelli we ordered as our entrees was a huge portion and it was good. Several members of the staff checked up on us several times during our meal, which is always nice. However, they did so much checking it got to the point where we had the attitude "just let us eat!" I definitely want to go back and try their brunch and I would go back for dinner again. Even though we were the youngest people in the restaurant by 30 years.
