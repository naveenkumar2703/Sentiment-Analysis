2	I like the Aldo chain of shoe stores because it is a pretty nice mixture of decent fashion, decent quality leather shoes, at decent prices. For men, it's like Clarks or Bass with more style, or Kenneth Cole without the designer price.  The two stars is for the staff/service. I didn't like the whiney voice of the person who helped us, she seemed off in her timing and attentiveness, should I say robotic sounding?Hey, I helped earn my way through college selling shoes, and later was a junior buyer at a regional department store chain early in my career, so I know a little something about shoes. The girl that helped us didn't. We didn't buy anything, but I professionally reboxed and stacked up the pairs of shoes for them to easily put away. That includes putting back all the tissue, cardboard, plastic, etc. that comes inside the box of every pair. The staff didn't seem to care less. Unprofessional. Just call me an old Shoe Dog.But a better breed than Al Bundy, the loser Horn Dog.
4	Super cute shoes.  Sales ladies are very helpful and nice.
5	I was on a hunt for heels with no luck. This was our last stop and I was getting a bit discouraged. I looked around and found nothing that I liked. All the heels were just waaaay to high for me to wear at work or were just boring. I eventually found my way to the clearance section where two pairs of flats caught my eye. My friend Loren found a pair she wanted to try on as well. The sales associate Jazlene was patient with us when we kept switching back and fourth with pairs. She also mentioned that they offer free shipping straight to my house if they didn't have a size in stock. I ended up purchasing the pair that Loren tried on for only $30. Just comfy black flats to run around in on crazy days at work. Although I didn't find what I originally came in for, I still had a good experience and walked out with something else. P.S. They also have really cute accessories like jewelry and purses.
