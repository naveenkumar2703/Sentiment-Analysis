5	I do my banking at the Nellis AFB branch (for over 3 years now) & have always been treated well there. Linda, Arlene, Michelle & pretty much all the reps have always been friendly & helpful. They even greet me by my first name & remember my boyfriend's name (also a member now), even though he doesn't have to go in that often & ask how we are all doing. Coming from a small town, it's nice to have that small town atmosphere in a city like this.
5	I only used the ATM here, but it was clean, well lit and I felt very safe. I liked that I didn't have to open my door to use it!
1	A credit union gone bad.  Nevada Federal is now One Nevada Credit Union.  Along with the name change, the service they provide has changed.  Gone is the special service that the military needed and got with the old Nevada Federal.  Today, One Nevada has forgotten it's commitment to the military and has started courting the Casino unions.  I don't understand why the military use them when there are better credit unions in town that do cater to the military.  Why are they still operating at Nellis?
1	Fees for "dormant" account stripped me of $20 over the course of a year and a half. Be warned. And be warned that tellers have no interest in helping. The gentleman there in the back office was nice and informative and that is about where the good service ends.
