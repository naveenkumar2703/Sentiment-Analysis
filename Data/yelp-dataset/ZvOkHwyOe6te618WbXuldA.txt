1	I never write bad reviews, but I was so upset after leaving this place.I called in before I came in to check on pricing on alterations and the girl told me $6-7 over the phone and so I was reluctant to bring my pants in right away. When I came to pick them up, they told me it was double that for each pair. It would have been one thing to understand that the customer was obviously misinformed bc I was surprised on the price and even explained to them what I was told by the other employee, but they had poor customer service by automatically telling me the manager would still make me pay before even trying anything. And that I wouldn't be able to find alterations for $6-7 anywhere, but it's not like I arbitrary picked $6-7 out of no where to get a cheap hem; this is what I was informed. Then they call the employee who misinformed me to make sure, even though I already got the impression they weren't gonna do anything about it. And the employee says she doesn't remember, so of course it's her word against mine, therefore they told me they can "take the hem out" or "give me a 10% discount". How generous of them....
1	Horrible! Many times my clothes have returned smelling like cigarette smoke. Very pricey too. I will never use their service again.
1	The Cleaner takes you to the Cleaners.  Wow - priceyThey don't disclose or post prices.  It was my first and last time to visit.  The Wynn charges less!  Holy crap.For the prices they charged, they could afford to deliver it to my home at midnight and still would have made money.   One shot, no love!
