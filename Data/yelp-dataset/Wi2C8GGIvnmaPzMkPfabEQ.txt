4	It's actually Salvadorean food.. The papusas here are delicious and if you go on Wednesdays, they are a dollar each if you buy 12 or more.. Which you will!! I recommend the papusas de revueltas, which have cheese, beans, and chicharron.. Don't forget the sauce!!
4	This was my first time trying pupusas. If you don't know what they are ...pupusas are made of corn and remind me of an empanada except it is flat like a pancake. I ate a pupusa that was stuffed with zucchini and cheese and it was delicious! It is great comfort food. They also had a pupusa with other types of meats (shrimp, pork, beef). I only had one pupusa but I was just in there for a snack and they are pretty decent sized...and very affordable. I think the one I had was around $2-$3 and the ones with meats were closer to $4-$6.
