3	The haircut was good...or so I thought until my next hairstylist at another place pointed out that one side of my hair that I had been sporting for months was longer than the other side. Ouch...!Anyway, before I went to the other stylist...I did call Renee Iannapollo again, my stylist at Dragonfly Hair Salon. She did not return my call. She called me a few days later claiming she had saved my voice mail and then forgot to retrieve it. Somehow she got my e-mail address, I really don't remember how...she keeps sending e-mails even though I have asked her to take me off her list. Anyway...only go here if you have a free haircut coupon which they send out if you are new in the area. Okay, so not everything was bad, was it. No. I enjoyed the attention Renee gave me while I was with her. She was sweet and attentive to my needs. I just like my calls returned on time and my hair-cut, completely, and no just one side.
5	Very Highly recommend Renee at Dragonfly Hair Salon in Ahwatukee. I came to her because I had a new in town coupon and was so very happy with my hair cut and color. I was nervous at first as I left in Texas a fabulous hairdresser so it was a great relief to find someone so soon who not only is VERY experienced but listened to my needs at the same time giving me fabulous suggestions. I love the fact that she gets back to be quickly when I call and will also text me a reminded which I like very much:)  Renee is very experienced with color which is an added plus, I like to mix a few shades to get a really nice natural yet funky look and she is AMAZING!!  Check her out you will not be disappointed!!
