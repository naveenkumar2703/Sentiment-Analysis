4	It's close. It's cheap enough. It's a few feet from Scratch Bakery. All these are great reasons to try Chaparral Cleaners and Laundry.I've been to a few dry cleaners where they "can't" get stains out of the clothes, and won't even try -- WTF??? Chaparral has never had any problems getting the huge coffee stains out of my white and khaki pants -- yes, I'm a clutz -- and they also haven't melted any of the beadwork on some of the other tops I've brought inhere -- and for that, I salute them.
4	I don't think I can say much about a dry cleaner to keep you glued to this review, but I will say I have had no problems in the 2 years I've used them.  No little tags that say "we tried and tried..but your garment still looks like crap."  The prices are reasonable, and a few of the girls even remember my name even though I'm not in all that often.  Nice touch.
5	Cant find their new address on yelp, but they moved to camelback and miller. I have been going here for about 8 years. I have never had a problem. I have got to know Dan over the years and he is a very nice person. And to top it off they can usually have my stuff back to me the same day.
