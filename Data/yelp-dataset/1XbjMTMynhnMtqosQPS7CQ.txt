5	I'm a big fan of FIB'S - Fine Italian Beef.  The food is great and the cart brings back memories of time spent in Chicago.  The meatball sub is the best I've ever had and a fellow worker, who's a professed chili hot dog expert says that FIB'S chili dog is the best she's had.I recently found out that the owner of the cart donates to local homeless shelters quite often.  Wonderful !
5	Very beautiful area with 8+ food trucks during the lunch rush and lots of benches to enjoy your food on! Surrounded by lovely gothic architecture to look at and tall trees providing shade....it can be a really serene place to relax. Of course sometimes there are events going on here and a random hardcore religious advocate shouting at the crowd.
