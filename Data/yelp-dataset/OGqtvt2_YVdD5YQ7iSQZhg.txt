1	Where in the world is Dr. Schwartz?  Sent an email via her web site for an appt 3 weeks ago -- no response.  Called the office 10 days ago for an appt and got only voice mail - no response.  Seems to be great at marketing her practice through mass mailings, but somebody is dropping the ball on follow up.  Glad I didn't have a toothache.
5	I wasn't expecting to get in, As this was an emergency appointment, I didn't expect to be able to see Dr. Schwartz so quickly, but as always the staff were there when I walked through the door, took me straight away, x-rays were done immediately, showed me them, discussed the problem, took notes and I rested a few minutes for the Dr. She was attentive, gave me all the time I needed to address the problem, discussed what may be going on, went over some additional hygiene issues and relieved my concerns. The staff at Healthy Smiles have always been exceptional. It's not just their friendliness, they really seem to care about me, discuss my family, remember events (some I have trouble remembering myself LOL). It feels like I'm with family when I walk in the office and that makes the whole experience really comforting. The professional standards of the staff are the highest I've experienced in 27 years in the valley. I trust them completely with my health.
5	This is the best dental office I've ever been to.  The level of detail and explanation that they give you is excellent.  They show you photos and X-rays over time on monitors and really take the time to explain every detail of your dental health.  They are friendly and have the best technology available. I couldn't recommend them more highly.
5	Best dentist in Scottsdale! Dr Schwartz is a perfectionist and works tirelessly to get her patients care done "just right". The office staff are incredibly friendly and I always enjoy visiting with them. Also, the office is clean and uses the most current technologies. I would highly recommend this dental office to my friends and family.
