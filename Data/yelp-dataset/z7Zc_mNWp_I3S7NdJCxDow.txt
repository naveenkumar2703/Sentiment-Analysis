1	Rawson Neal is under investigation for patient-dumping on a monumental scale, 1500 patients in 5 years.Shame. Not one of you should hold a medical license, and some of you should likely be in jail.
1	I'm so glad my mom was released after being there 3 months. I'm so happy she was not one of those dumped patients! The doc basically have up on her and told me there was nothing more they could do. I took her to Dr. Luis Ortega and it turns out they had been giving her medication that counteracted with each other!! Dr. Ortega did wonders and she has been doing great for almost 2 years!!This place deserves NO STARS!!!!
1	WARNING! Please Google this hospital before you seek any sort of treatment there for you or a loved one. This hospital have been heavily involved with patient dumping in the past few years. Basically they take their mentally ill patients, buy them a bus ticket and send them to states like California and Oregon...and then LEAVE them on the streets with no money, food or place to live. This is sickening, they should be closed down.
