3	Been here on a couple occasions, wife works not to far from here. I'll stop off and get her lunch! How nice of me!!!! Jack in the Box is alright. I do love their jalapeno poppers! Wife loves their tacos!!! Which I do to, I DON'T CARE IF IT CONTAINS MOSTLY OF SOY!!!! Daughter likes their teriyaki chicken bowl! Service is like most other fast food joints. Overall it's not a bad place to visit, you get what you want!
1	Stopped in here early Sunday morning on my way to work.  It made me remember why I avoid fast food.  Went through the drive-thru, paid for my food, got my food, and the guy said "have a nice day."He never gave me my change.I didn't say anything because it was only 20 cents, but I'll never return and I don't encourage anyone else to eat here.
1	Slowest place ever!!! It should not take over 10 min to get my food!!!! Ridiculous!!!!! I am never coming here again!!!!
