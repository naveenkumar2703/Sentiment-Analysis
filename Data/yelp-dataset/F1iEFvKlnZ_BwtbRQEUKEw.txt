3	Basically I came for the basics!I recieved a 10%$ off coupon and decided to go check it out! Now Ive frequented this Tillys as well as the one at the Crossings. I dont know if its just me, or what but I swear they never greet me!Here the store is very clean and organized. I love the jewelery from here! Its sooo cute and pretty! They also carry a wide assortment of Volcom, DC's, Etnies, Osiris, and Roxy. They have both girl and guy clothing as well clothes for children.The pricing is a little high, but you can usually find some clothes on clearance that suffice! Another thing I like is their watch selection! Vestal, Nixon, and Neff! All my faves and priced right! If they dont carry the one you want you can also order it!The only thing I would work on is the customer service!
1	Walked no one greeted us, on top of that a guy working on the shoes saw us looking at them didn't say anything to us and some lil girl walked by us multiple times even helping some kid but didn't say anything to us. My girlfriend had to grab her own shoes and since she couldn't find her size in the ones she wanted she then had to ask even then they snatched the shoes out of her hand and continued to go on to the next kid. I definitely won't be returning to this store at all. And won't recommend it to anyone either.
