3	Sales people here were nice.  Store looked clean.
3	Bought 3 things: coat, T-shirt and jacket. Got good discounts, 30 % off the original prices, but BIG line. Store was huge and clean, but 3 stars cause cashiers weren't doing their job perfectly.
1	Although I do like the merchandise, I found one of the employees to be very rude. He "caught" me taking a picture of a pair of jeans. He immediately approached me and told me that I'm not allowed to take pictures of any merchandise. I explained to him I was merely buying a gift for someone and wanted to make sure they would like it. He told me in a very accusatory tone that I should look for pictures online and then he wouldn't stop starring at me, basically treating me like a criminal. I wanted to leave but I still made the purchase. At checkout, I asked the cashier about their policy and she told me that it is true; however when I asked to see if they had posted any signs alerting customers not to take pictures, they didn't have one. I can respect the rules, but I don't think it is reasonable to assume that one can't take photos. So if you really don't want people taking photos, put a sign up, and if you don't have a sign, don't be rude about it and treat customers like criminals. I know for next time, but there won't be a next time. I'll shop somewhere normal!
4	This outlet store offers quality & a nice selection in most sizes. The staff is always helpful & know what is available, coming it etc. Sometimes they lack the XXL sizes for my guy. I wish they stocked a little bit more for tall people or large guys. That is the only reason that I give them 4 stars instead of 5. I hope they are listening. I would love to upgrade this to a 5 star!!!
