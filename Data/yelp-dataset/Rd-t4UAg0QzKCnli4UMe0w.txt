1	Got quote on repairing my Benz.  Asked why installing this particular additional item takes an hour of labor.  Guy said that installation takes at least an hour.  Confirmed that had not started installation, then authorized installation.  Guy thought that I wasn't going to wait in waiting area.  Mechanic came back about 12 minutes later to advise the guy I was speaking with that vehicle ready.  Paid the guy and let him know I'm not coming back.
5	Alex is awesome! No matter what Mercedes I send to him he takes care of the issues. The review above this one is an idiot. Go to Mercedes direct and you will find out the one hour minimum charge that is done at any mechanic shop is more than doubled at Mercedes.
5	I have been going here for a couple of years and this is THE BEST MERCEDES REPAIR SHOP IN ARIZONA!  I am impressed by the honesty and service that I get. I read a 2013 review by another customer and suggest if you can't wait 12 minutes for your car to be fixed PROPERLY you probably need to drive a different car! These guys are HONEST and COMPETENT!!
