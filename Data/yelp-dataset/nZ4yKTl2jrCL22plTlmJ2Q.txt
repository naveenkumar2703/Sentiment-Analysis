4	Gave this food truck a try at Vegas StrEATs. $1 off if you like them on facebook. The grilled cheese is creative and fun and really great sourdough bread. Only downside is that it seemed expensive for $8 for a gourmet grilled cheese, but with the $1 off it was doable. I tried the california grilled cheese. It was tasty comfort food.
5	Unbelievable grilled cheese sandwiches!! The best you will ever experience.  OMG
5	Was excited to try their lobster grilled cheese, tried it at the Food Fest and it was AMAZING! I actually couldnt find the truck to begin with so had a lobster grilled cheese from another truck, it was god awful so I was hoping Melteez  would impress me after the crappy one I just had and it definitely did! The lobster was fresh unlike the other. Cant wait to have another!
1	Waited 45 minutes for an order that was supposed to take 10. Worst part wasn't the wait, the worst part was that with 5 people working the truck we were only given an update on our order 1 time, about 20 minutes into our wait. Mechanical problems are understandable, poor customer service is never excusable. After 45 minutes I asked for a refund, the lady taking the money asked the guy in the truck for the status of the order. He shrugged. I got my refund and moved on. They were also out of over half their menu items at opening time. Back to poor customer service. This is not a truck with it's act together.
