5	When I first moved out here from Michigan, I lived up in Anthem for about 10 months back in 2005/2006.  Being an avid scrapbooker, this was my store of choice.  Partly because I was living in no mans land, and secondly, because this place is a great store.This is a great place for all kinds of stuff.  Its owned by a lady who is in and out of the store on a regular basis, and she really knows what shes doing.  Great paper stock, stickers, albums, all the stuff you need.  I like the fact that she also covers a lot of ground with her product.  Not just wedding and baby stuff, but everything you could imagine, in regards to variety. This place was worth the trip, despite being up in Anthem.  I went here because it had been a while, and I wanted some variety and a walk down memory lane.  Will return in the future, as its worth every mile.
5	I love this place!!  I am not as dedicated to scrapbooking as I would like to be.  This store makes me feel welcome & comfortable even though I am a novice.
