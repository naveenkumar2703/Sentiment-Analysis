5	i drove up from the land of lincon to see my bestest band friends...the safes...play the king club.they rocked the house.and the king club is a great small venue. totally chill and awesome. check it out if you are madison.just don't ever touch frankie o'malley's hair.
5	Ever since hosting iQ nights I've gotten to love the King Club. The owner and staff are incredibly nice and fun. Small venue provides for a great live music experience.
1	So, everyone that has ever taken a flight has seen that one other really attractive person waiting in line and hoped that they would end up sitting next to them by some random twist of fate.I was the lucky man once. Her name was Ashley. She was a traveling salesperson working in the education field. She was a cute petite little blond with eyes that could light up the night.On our second date, I took her to the king club. I never saw her again. I blame the bar. Clearly this situation is not my fault.
