3	Not an outstanding place. Just a neighborhood joint. I have been coming here for years. They have 3 pool tables and a jukebox and for the most part a full bar. I say this because they are regularly out of the brandy I drink which is not top shelf. First it's kinda dumpy, the crowd is a mix of people, the area can seem a little ify. It's dark and a little on the small side. Most of the servers are ding-bats, you kinda expect it in a joint like this. But if you just want to shoot some pool, have a beer and relax this place is A-OK! I must say I do love their wings and fries very tasty. I will call in orders to go for those. They are yummy. They have a pretty big menu. My friends like the other stuff they have I just always stick to my wings and fries.
1	They do live music here, and my band was scheduled to play recently. In the email in which we were booked, we stated that two of the band members are under 21, but they are 20.Now, we have played at many venues around the Valley, and it has NEVER been a problem. They put big, black "X"s on our hands, or wrist bands, whatever, and we ALWAYS follow the rules. Once we arrived, they were in frickin' SHOCK AND AWE that we would even be there because of our age. The owner came out to "talk" to us, more like demean us, and told us we can play at 1am, when the liquor license people wouldn't come in. Before he did this, we had offered to stay outside and only go to the stage and out, very politely.But even after that the owner felt the need to tell us that we obviously don't care about his business, but its WHAT PAYS FOR HIS KIDS SHOES.Can't imagine how a dump like that even pays for shoes. So we politely declined to stay and do something illegal, and left.You're right, NOW we don't care.
