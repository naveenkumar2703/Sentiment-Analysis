4	There's something about clean polished beech wood, colourful cushions and unusual designs that grabs me. Like an Ikea but primarily focused on seating and cushions, Futon stocks plenty to kit your new bachelor pad out. Expect to pay a healthy amount for some unique designs, they currently throw in a cushion football with any purchase too. Will that tempt you?
4	The Futon Company sells um... futons, other home furniture and quirky accessories too. The shop feels very stylish and most of the furniture reminds me of the kind of thing you'd see kitted out in a stylish young professionals apartment. It wasn't so much the furniture that caught my interest, but a couple of cute gadgets. They had a selection of miniature plastic welly boots that had little seeds inside that you could grow into your very own plant. They also had an egg with the same idea, it had seeds inside and you cracked the top off to start growing. Lovely little novelty items and perfect for little gifts such as stocking fillers or Secret Santa type presents. They often do sales, so pop in when they're on and you might pick up an excellent bargain!
3	Everything about Futons, from their usually minimalist stylings down to their pretentious sounding name, reeks to me of the late 90s, when a spinach and ricotta pizza was considered a bit upmarket and IKEA furniture hadn't quite become a lifestyle symbol for every young professional, or non-professional.Sort of practical, but in effect just a posh word for a sofabed, I don't see me purchasing one soon.
5	I recently bought several shelves from here. The manager Lisa was great.  It's (unfortunately) rare that I rave about customer service, but I'm very happy to shop there again as she went out of her way for me.
