5	After reading great things about the workout at Body Lab & seeing that your first class is free, I gave it a try a couple weeks ago. It's in a great location off Hayden in a strip mall with plenty of parking. As you walk in there are cubbies for your things & a small retail area. There are 12 machines total that are spaced out well so you won't hit your neighbor. The class is 50 minutes & totally different than anything I've tried. It's similar to being on a reformer but with more capabilities - we did rowing moves, lunges, various arm exercises, planks, etc. It's pretty easy to follow along but not as easy to do everything that the instructor says - but for every move there is a modified move, so this class truly is for anyone & everyone. After my first free class I bought a 10 pack since the workout was great & both the instructors and fellow body labers were so nice. Check it out!
4	I have bulging discs in my lower back and this workout doesn't usually aggravate them. Classes are a combination of cardio and strength. Great workout. Great location. It's expensive though and some teachers are definitely better than others. I always appreciate being corrected on my form, which not everyone does.
5	Scott's classes are hands down the best!!  The 50 minutes fly right by and the workout is really great!
