5	One of my best finds in Arizona was Sierra Family Denistry after I found the dental office across the street from them to be sub-par. Dr. Rauschel and his staff are awesome, caring, fun & professional people - we love them. My husband and I have gotten excellent dental care there, including crowns and extractions, and every experience has been pleasant. Definitely give them a try if you're looking for a dentist in the East Valley!
4	Really nice people, always treated me very fair. Good services and reasonable prices.
5	This has been the most pleasant experience I have ever had at a dental office. Had 3 teeth extracted and the doctor was awesome! They took really good care off and I will definitely be returning here for all my dental work!
