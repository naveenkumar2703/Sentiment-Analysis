1	two years ago for Christmas I bought myself an iphone here. I was sooo excited about it. everything was fine until a month later when I realized I was charged for 9 more iphones!!!!! I had 6 over-draft fees plus the cost of the phones I called the store the guy I was talking to got nervous and said its not possible...I talked to the store manager he said he looked up the transaction and saw that there was a card swiped, he was sure about it and said call VISA and talked to them this has nothing to do with us someone stole your card or made a copy of it (I never lost my card) i called my bank they said the card was entered in 3 times. I realized that the manager lied to me. I did get my money back and I called AT&T told them about it....they didn't seem to care that much about it...I guess they made the sale they didnt care how. all that said I still love my phone and I am happy with my AT&T service, but I do recommend ppl not to do business with this store. there is another one on the same street a couple of blocks up
2	This att is always clean but the employees are Not that knowledgeable, and will make up anythinh as they go.
5	I'm not sure why this location got a low review, but I had a very pleasurable experience. I was there yesterday. Hessie was particularly helpful as was his female co-worker, who's name I didn't get. They put the screen protector on, recommended a nice Jabra hands free set, and paired the device with my phone.
