1	Disclaimer: This happened a couple years ago, so maybe things have changed since. I went to this guy to get a pair of slacks altered to fit my stubby legs. He was nice until he surprised me with a kiss on the mouth and intent for tongue slippage. Avoid, unless you're really lonely or something.
1	This man is incredibly rude.  I went to him for hems on pants and re-hem on a skirt.  I said him price of $90.00 seemed a bit high and he yelled at me and told me to never come back.  I hadn't planned to use him again, but didn't want to be impolite and tell him I wouldn't be back, until he yelled at me.
5	The last of the best. Highly trained in Italy for years before e has mastered his skills. Expensive but awesome!
