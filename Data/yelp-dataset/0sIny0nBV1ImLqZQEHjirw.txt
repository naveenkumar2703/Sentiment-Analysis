1	This place seems to have a nice selection of linens but somehow they never have IN STOCK what I NEED. I came in here for a Bed-In-a-Bag Set and they had tons of them but none in the size I needed. I asked the employee if they had any other sizes in the back and she said "no" and walked away. She didn't offer to locate a store that had it or anything, lol! On the way out she had the nerve to ask if I found what I needed... "ummmmm No!"
4	Great selections and variety! The price isn't that bad either. The staff wasn't as friendly at first, but they did put my purchase aside for later that night when they had a 'Anna party'(20% off)
1	There store employee/manager kristin is not at all friendly. She acts like she's doing a million things instead of providing customer service.
3	Great selection. The manager on duty was so nice and accommodating. But, I walked in at about 7:55 and was told by a salesperson before I even walked in that I would need to hurry because they were closing in 5 min. I was coming to get pillows and I thought that was pretty rude.
1	I am from Dallas, and their stores are MUCH more organized!! It was ridiculous and unsafe how high they had the bed-in-a-bags stacked!! I love Anna's but will NEVER go back to this store unless they get some good employees to do their job and organize the store!
