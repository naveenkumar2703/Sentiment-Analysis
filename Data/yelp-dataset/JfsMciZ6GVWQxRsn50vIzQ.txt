4	I went to this office for the first time two days ago. I saw Dr. Kirit Patel. He was awesome. He was very friendly and he took his time to explain everything to me and answer all my questions. I don't know what other reviewers on these websites are talking about when they say the staff is very rude and the Doctors are all yelling and cussing. That was not my experience at all. I thought everyone was very friendly and professional. I am very satisfied with the service I received here. I definitely am keeping Dr. Patel as my PCP.
1	Definitely the worse place I have ever been to. VERY unprofessional and rude people. They told us to come in a half an hour early just to make us wait two hours when there were NO other children there. The blonde girl at the front desk talked to my husband with a rude tone. The pediatric that my daughter saw (Chamberlin) was also very rude and argued with us over giving our daughter the flu vaccine. He actually opened the door and yelled out into the office that we were not wanting to receive the vaccine so that everyone was aware of it. Not only that but he looked unprofessional. Wrinkly shirt and not even tucked in. His assistant had piercings on her face as well. On top of that, when we walked out to leave, not one person thanked us or told us to have a nice day or anything. This is not a place I would NEVER go back to!!
1	Waited 45 minutes after entering the room. Very rude in how they push their shots and lecture you. Choose a different place that is cleaner for your kids.
1	Very long wait times. Place is a fairly dirty. Room was hot while we were waiting. This is true for each our first 4 pediatric visits. We are changing doctors.
