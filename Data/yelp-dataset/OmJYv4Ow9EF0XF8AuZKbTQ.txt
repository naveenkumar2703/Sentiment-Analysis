4	The inside of this place is clean and welcoming. They offer a variety of services: postal, faxing, copy, printing, notary, etc. The staff could be a little friendlier and smile more often. The store is conveniently located next to a smiths store.
1	Very rude lady. She can be more friendly. Every customer deserves respect.
1	Stopped by here after work just after 5 pm on a Tuesday and it was closed!  The website said 6pm and here on yelp it says 7pm closing time.  There is no sign on the door for hours either.  Very disappointed because this was my go-to place for all things shipping.  Only for people who don't work during the day, I guess.Update: so apparently it is going out of business....  I drove by there again and the sign was down and there were a lot of boxes behind the cage.
