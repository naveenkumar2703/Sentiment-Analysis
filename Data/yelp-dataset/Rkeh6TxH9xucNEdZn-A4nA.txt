4	i love this dior bouitque its the best looking one in las vegas, plus best service
4	A beautiful boutique to take in. Staff was knowledgeable and gracious - walked us through a nice selection of the dresses as well as history behind the watches. Boutique is quite large, including dresses, shoes, handbags, watches and jewelry. Dresses are located in the back, along with stunning coats and a few fur pieces. Several Lady Diors on display as well as the Diorissimo collection.
5	Being one of the only Dior Homme Men's stores on the Strip, I had very high expectations. I've gone back and forth between purchasing denim and finally decided to pull the trigger this time around. Adam was the gentleman who helped me find the right fit, offered his insight, and overall found me the pair of denim I was really looking for. Above all things, customer service was top notch. I can't say enough good things about Adam as well as the friendliness of each employee I ran into while walking around the store. Unlike previous experiences at other retailers in Las Vegas, I wasn't judged or shunned based on what I was wearing. Most high end retailers will do that to you... but not here.I was also fitted for a tux for my upcoming wedding even though I only came in looking for jeans. I have to say the whole overall experience was top notch, and everything you would expect from a store like Dior. If you are ever in need of anything Mens, you NEED to see Adam Sullinger. He has so much knowledge and is a great person. Ended up leaving with a new tuxedo and the jeans I had searching for. This place is highly recommended in my book.
