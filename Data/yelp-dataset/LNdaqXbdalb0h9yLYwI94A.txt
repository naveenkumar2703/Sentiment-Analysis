5	The good news and bad news of not needing a lot of home maintenance (though it will start to pick up, I'm sure) is that when something is needed the tedious process of checking out services begins. My wife and I are so fortunate to have been introduced to Jerry at Cobra.  Yesterday, I made the call and he was so responsive and dependable. He came to our house in the time frame that was promised (already a stellar move) and performed the work that was needed. He is thorough, makes great suggestions (not trying to upsell) and then follows up with a proper inspection of all related operations.  For those who already know about this contractor, this is not news. For those who are praying that "Fix-It" will provide good people (and I have been one of those), I would encourage you to check out Jerry at Cobra!  Dr, B
5	I have used this plumbing company twice now. Each time, the serviceman was prompt and courteous, getting to the problem at hand and explaining everything to me that he was fixing. He showed me how to clean the line so that I did not need to make calls in the future. He also checked but did not fix/overcharge for things that really did not need to be done when correcting things on an inspection report pre-house sale. Prices were more than reasonable. I will not use another company!
