5	Best massage in Phoenix.  Moved here three years ago and have tried in vain to find a GREAT massage until now.  David was attentive to my needs and I left completely satisfied.  Doesn't hurt that he is charming as well.
5	David gives the best message.  I have never felt this good after getting a message he definitely has the magic touch and gets the knots out of my neck and shoulders without killing me.  I love the lotions he uses as they make me feel great and they are not oily.  You have got to try David he is the best ever
5	Spectralite is located in a beautiful historical house.  Very comfortable, great music, and an amazing massage.  David is incredibly kind, intuitive and knows just what spots need his gentle attention.  An excellent, relaxing experience, certainly, but also knowledgeable and healing treatment for more serious issues.

5	David gives a great massage and is very attentive  to your specific issues. His studio is beautiful, very clean and relaxing. I highly recommend him!David
5	David added a new aquarium to his message room which is very relaxing and I love looking at it while he works on my back.  The oils David uses make all the difference in not making me feel greasy when I leave and they have a great smell.  David has mastered the ability to get the knots out of my shoulders without causing me a great deal of pain in the process like a lot of message theoropists do.  He always seems to be able to find every spot that was bothering me without me having to tell him.Awesome job
