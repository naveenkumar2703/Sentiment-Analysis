3	I dont find myself in River Island too much. I dont think the clothes they sell particulary different or interesting. However they do sell some lovely maxi dresses for the summer but this is only avaliable in the largers stores. The few times I have entered this retailer I have found the attitudes of the staff much to be desired.
