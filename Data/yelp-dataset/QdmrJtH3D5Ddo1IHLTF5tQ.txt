4	We also picked a Mercat Tour, on the hunt for Ghosts & Gauls, which started on street level and ending going through the vaults. The nice part of the tour is that we all ended up in a tavern in the vaults and a drink having a very good laugh. You needn't believe in anything that is being said it's all about having some fun and a little bit of history thrown in for extra. I think the group was a little on the big side, controlling a group of 25/30 must distract from the overall fun of the tour. Very enjoyable and very silly.
5	Fantastic company that do great tours would recomend to anyone.
