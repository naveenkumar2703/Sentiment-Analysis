4	This place is hidden on the side of the Fry's shopping plaza.   Good place to get Mexican seafood. Food was very delicious and fresh.  I would suggest to bring a native Spanish speaker to help you with the menu.
3	Tried this place last Sunday, for our father's day "cheat meal". I had high hopes and was strongly craving some decent mexican seafood. Upon entering we noticed that there was a guy set up in the back with a laptop and some really loud speakers DJ-ing ranchero music. I am unclear if this was because it was father's day or if this is the normal scene on weekends. Either way the music was so loud you cannot hear the waitress or each other.We ordered a large shrimp cocktail and a shrimp quesadilla to share. Service time wasn't super quick, but we weren't in a huge hurry so this wasn't a major issue. The waitress brought us some chips and a good greenish colored salsa - I am assuming it was tomatillo based. A little while later we received our cocktail and our quesadilla. Both were ok, but the shrimp in each had the mudvain still intact. The cocktail was on the watery side but did contain a decent amount of shrimp (albeit dirty shrimp) and avocado. The quesadilla was cheesy and overstuffed. I picked out the shrimp with an obvious mudvain and continued to eat the quesadilla because it did have a good flavor.The wait for our check was excessive and we eventually had to flag down the waitress to request the bill. I am doubtful that I will eat here again, but I have heard from friends that the other items on the menu are pretty good.
5	Good place to get some good street tacos, not a lot of tables, and my favorite the shrimp cocktail. We will be back for sure.
1	Not coming back! I ordered a shrimp dish and I saw them microwave a frozen Baggie of shrimp. Disgusting! I drank my beer, canceled my order and left.
1	This place sucks so much. Ordered street tacos, meat tasted like canned beef and the tortillas tasted like cheap store bought. Will never go back.
