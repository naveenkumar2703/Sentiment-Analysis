5	I planned my reception myself and used Creative Events for a big part of my site- ranging from the tables to table cloths to the beautiful white dance floor. The staff there, Lisa, in particular, was a joy to work with- very responsive and patient (which was great as my order changed a lot of times). They delivered and picked up everything exactly as promised and were very professional and fast. They also have tons to choose from and will help you make the best choice for your money. Pricing was competitive too. Highly recommend!
1	If I could give 0 stars I would! These people are the worst!. My Staff hired this rag tag crew and I wish I could of researched them more before a tight deadline. Ruined my Holiday party, Unprofessional and lousy cheap rental equipment. No customer service skills and when I told them I was unhappy they said.. "OH WELL".... They are truly a bait and switch... BEWARE!! Stay Clear!!!
5	I have used Creative Event Rentals for a few different events and all I can say is WOW!  They are truly professionals and went above and beyond to make my events look AMAZING.  Jayne and her staff are just top notch!
