4	A small but handy spot to get our lotto tix, pick up Redbox movie and get a car wash.  It is small, 6 pump stations, but convenient. Attendants (in my experience here) have always been polite and professional.  Parking lot and store inside tidy.  The car wash is "brushless" so it saves wear on our paint job....great little convenience store/gas/car wash spot in Surprise!
4	Easy to find, I love the parking lot design, and gas was cheapest!
