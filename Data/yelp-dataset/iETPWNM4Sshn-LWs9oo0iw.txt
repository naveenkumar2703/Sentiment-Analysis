5	You know, we get a lot of crap living way out here, but I really love my town.  I love the small town feel and the hidden gems that you find when you are not looking.  Sure, we have some idiots in office that have made bad decisions, but I think as we get a little bigger (not to big I hope) there will be more voice from the people in this small town.  Roads need fixing for sure, but we chose to live out here, at least I did, so I knew what they were like - so for me to sit and do nothing but complain about it would be idiotic.  You knew what you were getting into people!  Anyway, I really do love it out here and plan on making this my home until I can afford a house on the beach in Ventura (true goal someday)  Even so, I will probably keep my home here and go between the two places - that's how much I love the desert and living out here!  Thanks for helping me have a happy life with my family out here Queen Creek!!
5	Queen Creek living is the Life...I have lived in the Valley for most of my 35 years and this is the best place I have been, West side, East Side and South Side...it's got that small town feel, you know your neighbors and the scenery is still somewhat rural...The worst part = school choices are limited for the discerning parent, but schlep into Chandler for private school and enjoy the quiet life in the "country" the rest of the time.
