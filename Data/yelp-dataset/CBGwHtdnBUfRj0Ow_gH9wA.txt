5	Excellent service cute clothes and kids trinkets and toys. The real reason this place ranked is that my kids were goofing off in there and the clerk/possible owner, a kind lady with a magnificent British accent who hails from Nottingham said they were very well behaved. When we left after buying a couple of small toys, she told both of my crumb crunchers to take another small toy they had been playing with and would not accept any money for the toys.
3	My assistant and I stop into Rascals once a week to look at clothes for our family and friends who have young children. They are right next to Starbucks, so it is always a treat after picking up a cup of our favorite brew. Rascals has an excellent selection that borders on the creative. I have always been impressed by the above average quality of the material used in their kids clothes.  They do a nice job!
4	Cute little kids clothing shop next door to my salon. A little on the pricy side, but I don't expect less in that area. Bought Baby C the following - a pair of sunglasses...$ 6  a Curious George stuffed toy...$ 20and the best purchase...although very expensive in J's opinion...handmade doggy hooded towel...$ 45Now I know what you're thinking...I'm crazy for spending $ 45 on a towel. Why not get 3 packs of hooded towels you can get from target or babies r us at that price. Well let me tell you, we have those target and babies r us towels. They are flimsy, suck at absorbing, and Baby C always got chilled.This towel I purchased was top quality and an adult size bath towel. Baby C loves it and I can get him immediately warm from his bath. :)Good purchase and a great store!
