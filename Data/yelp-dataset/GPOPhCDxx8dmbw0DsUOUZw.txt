2	I usually get on here for positive reviews but this is not one of those.  I was quoted over a thousand dollars of repairs on a car that  I baby every month.  I was concerned but got a little work done and then had over $600 left of repairs to do when I left.  While driving away, I noticed that my car drove worse when I left.  A few days later they called and asked me when I was coming in to get my brakes done since they were on their last leg, according to Thompsons.I held off and got a second opinion.   I brought it to Sunland Auto on Val Vista and Broadway.  Bob was a huge help and also showed me that my brakes had 50-60% pad left still and were fine.  I felt very deceived by Thompsons.  Not only that, but ther work that needed to get done was only going to cost me a quarter of what Thompsons quoted me.   Over all, I saved more than $400 dollars by using Sunland on Broadway and Val Vista and my car drives amazingly.   I am in great hands with Bob, Chuck, and their team.
5	This place has taken my Mitsubishi Montero over 200,000 miles and will take it another 200,000. It's not easy to find good, reliable and trustworthy auto mechanics and when you do, hang onto them.  This is one of those places.
1	We're triple A members and got stranded by the side of the road, and these guys were supposed to tow us. Even though their shop is 10 minutes away from where we were stranded, and AAA said they would be there in less than an hour, we waited two hours for these clowns, Finally, we called someone else and they were there in ten minutes. When we pulled out, 2 1/2 hours after we called, one of their clowns showed up with a cigar in his mouth, and a pissed off expression on his face. So if you have a lot of extra time, and want to deal with troglodytes who look like they should be at a pagan rally, sacrificing suburbanites who broke down by the side of the road like some kind of bad Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, then by all means, call  these guys.
