3	SW corner of Cactus & 75th ave. location (Yelp map is incorrect, but the address is correct).  They were staffed well today and the line moved reasonably fast.  Sandwich prep area was clean and the ingredients looked fresh and appetizing.  Bread was fresh, as usual.  Overall food wasn't bad, but wasn't great either - the ususal for Subway.  Cheap food.
4	Fantastic customer service :)I said vegetarian sandwich, and he automatically got new gloves and a new knife for me. Actually help me to the beginning to end.
1	Been waiting to pay for my subs for about ten min with the two lady's looking like there to high to operate a cash drawer
