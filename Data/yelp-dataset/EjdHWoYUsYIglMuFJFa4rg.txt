3	Had my first Charley's meal. Went with the Philly Steak grilled sub with the mushrooms, onion and bell pepper. Never saw the mushrooms I ordered and paid extra for! Even though I asked the cook if he had added them. Also had the bacon cheese fries. I've had much better cheese fries.So I'm a little disappointed. But the place was alright over all.They have a great menu so I'm going to say A-ok for now. 'll try them again at some point since I got a punch card and its near where I often shop and my friends kids like the place.
3	The menu here is a bunch of creative sandwiches, all done up on a flat-top, Philly style. They use fresh ingredients and the bread is really tasty. I don't eat fries much, but theirs are not too greasy.The place is always filthy, so I'll take them down a star.
4	Man, I really like Charleys. I know it is in the mall, but the location outside of the mall was where I used to go in a couple times a month. Sometimes, I think about going to PV Mall and planning it around lunch. The fries are crispy, hot and fresh! I ask them to mix me up 1/2 ranch 1/2 BBQ sauce. Stir it up real well and dip the fries in it. Whoo baby, that is GOOD stuff.
