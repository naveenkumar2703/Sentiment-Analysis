5	I have known Chelsea for a couple of years;  seen numerousl people who she colors their hair and it looks great.  Her haircuts and styles are also fabulous, our whole family benefits from her talent.  She is a fantastic lady who is fun loving, hilarious and compassionate. On top of all this her prices are very reasonable, you have to give her a try. You'll love her!!!
5	I am the happy owner of a new pair of lucious lashes! They look amazing and I am officially hooked. Thanks Chelsea, I look forward to seeing you in 10 days for my fill. (She has an incredible offer for 3 fills per month.) That means, they will look perfect all month long.. Every time I bat my lashes, I will think of you.
5	I just got an amazing haircut and style from Chelsea, she listened to everything I said and asked questions to be sure I got exactly what I wanted. Her shop is so cute and she was friendly and really talented! Thanks Chelsea, you'll definitely see me again :)
5	Ever leave the salon looking and feeling like a million bucks, only to wash and style it yourself and realize you can't maintain the look? Yeah, used to happen to me too. Now that I go to Chelsea at Glass Hair & Lash Bar, that doesn't happen anymore.  Not only does the style look great when I leave, but Chelsea always gives a style that I can maintain on my own. She also did my "wedding hair" and looked stunning! I would give her a million stars just for that alone. I highly recommend this salon - You can't ask for better!!!!
5	Last weekend I got yet another amazing hair cut from Chelsea!   My hair can be difficult, with it being so baby fine, but Chelsea always manages to make it look amazing.  She even lightened it from boxed red to a blonde without damaging it!  Every time I go here, I receive nothing but compliments on my hair for weeks afterward. :-)
