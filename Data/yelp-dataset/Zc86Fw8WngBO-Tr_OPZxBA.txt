3	Obey the snake and go see the naughty Eves at Eden's stripper garden, Mr Adam.  Just a block or two up from the Rio and Palms, so this smaller strip club is one of the closest to the Strip.  The numbers are similar to the rest: $30 cover (out of state), $6 beers, $20 lap dances. It's a nice size place, not as big as the warehouse that is Sapphires or as ultra lounge crowded as Spearmint Rhino.The apples here are mostly Red Delicious, not so many Granny Smiths.  I've heard tales of a lot of Granny sightings, but I think it depends on what night you go.  Try to go on a Fri or Sat.
