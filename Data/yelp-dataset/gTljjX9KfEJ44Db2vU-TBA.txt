5	Most fabulous and affordable facial in the valley! All the pampering of the resorts without the price tag. I've been going to Maria Elena for years and even turned my mother and teenage daughter on to her.
5	Love this lady!  She treats you so GOOD!  I have been going to her for years and have sent some friends and family and they love her too!  I have had facials and waxing at the other places and nobody beats Maria!  And the neck massage is to die for!
5	Maria Elena is the only person that I trust to wax me! She is the absolute best and I will never go to anybody else...unless she moves which I hope she won't! She always make sure that I'm comfortable and at ease. Super duper great service every time. Very friendly and professional! I highly recommend booking with Maria Elena. You won't regret it!
5	I've been going to Maria Elena for years and love her!  Not only is she by far the most hygienic aesthetician I've been to, she's also the loveliest!
