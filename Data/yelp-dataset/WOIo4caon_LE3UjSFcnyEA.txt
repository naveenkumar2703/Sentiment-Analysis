4	Great selection of clubs and bags at this location.  They were very helpful in assisting me with ordering custom PING irons.  Not too pretentious in here, and it's very convenient right off the 101 at Frank Lloyd Wright.
3	I have gone to this shop for a while now and have been pretty satisfied with the crew and service. You can't go wrong with the 90 day return/exchange policy and they have a pretty good selection. Also have an indoor putting green and some bays to test out clubs. Good location, nice and close to many good courses. I prefer Vans over Golfsmith anyday.
4	I love golf stores.  I never buy very much, but I really enjoy browsing and looking at all the golf related  merchandise.  This store is kind of hard to get to at first, but well worth the effort once you find it..  Although not as big as some of it's competitors, it has a great selection of clubs, golf clothes, and accessories.  It has an area you can try out clubs, and also a repair center.  The customer service is great, and there is always someone to help with questions.  They seem to have a wider selection of used clubs and older models at fairly reasonable prices than other stores in the area.  It might just be that it is seasonal, but every time I am there I find used and older clubs that are either on sale, or priced very reasonably. Plus, they have Titleist and Footjoy products.Great place to shop - I always find myself stopping there on my golf store outings and checking out their new additions.
