5	AMAZING!!!! I booked an appointment at My Baby Bump Imaging and went in for my appointment today and I am beyond amazed with this facility! First of all the person who booked my appointment was great and knew the answers to all of my questions. I had a lot! Secondly, the pricing is so reasonable! I looked at places that were significantly higher! For the experience I received I would pay to do this all the time! Thirdly, this place is so clean and spacious. The walls are bright with color. The sofas in the viewing room are so comfortable. Lastly, Whitnie was the best ultra sound technician my husband and I have ever met. She was so patient, knew the best way to make my baby look great in the pictures, so friendly, and made my whole family feel so welcomed! We took a huge family picture at the end of our appointment. It was great! I cannot say enough positive things about this place!
5	I bought a Groupon for this in February and we were able to use it on Valentine's Day.  It was a great present for both my husband and I since this is our first baby.  We were so excited to see him up close and personal.  The ultrasound tech was very friendly and the place overall was nice.  I would definitely recommend them.
5	Whitney is the owner and was so helpful, comforting and professional. I have been to 2 other elective ultrasound facilities for this and a past pregnancy, and had so-so experiences. I will be going here again soon, and highly recommend this facility. Prices were competitive if not lower than most and very cute decor.
