1	The store is located at the mall and that's about the only positive thing to say here.There's always someone at the door getting your name and why you are visiting the store. You get your name put into the waiting list and then you get to wait until someone asks all the same questions from you again. At least lately they simplified the process and ask for few details.If you have technical issues, after some typical responses, like "Have you done roaming update yet?" They might eventually get to fixing, or not.If you have any complaints about service or equipment... tough luck. No one cares, they will tell you that they can't help you flat out. No one cares how many years you've been using their services (8 in my case), they are just not interested in providing a service outside of selling you a phone plan. Numerous sales guys/gals at this store proved their uselessness here. There are no attempts to look for a solution and a blank stare with a sprinkle of contempt is the best response you can hope for. Conclusion: just avoid the store, waiting on the phone line can at least be done in your underwear.
1	This place is so awful.... I walk in with a Droid 2 Global I had just gotten in the mail because my last 3 messed up.. This one as well did the same... It wasnt making calls 100% the time like it should... So i go in and tell the salesmen what was wrong with the phone... he looks at it and says... OHHHH I SEEE... there is lent in the head speaker... REALLLY!? LENT!? come on dude... then i said i doubt thats it... he comes back to say its a combo of the lent and holding the phone cock eyed... OMFG. I was raging pissed off. But he made a call and it worked (this time) so I couldnt say anything.. Later that night it does it again... But really for them to even say that was whats wrong? wow.
