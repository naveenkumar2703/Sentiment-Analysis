5	This is a great walgreens for pharmacy. Before I was going to the one down lake mead by rampart. There I would frequently have to wait in line to pick up things for a long time, they wouldn't be able to refill same day etc. I think that location is open 24hours but who goes to the pharmacy at 3AM other than drug addicts? Answer- no one. So I am more than willing to trade convenience for shorter hours.
5	Love this Pharmacy.  Just avoid their senior days you'll be fine. Cleanest walgreens I've been to, and just a walking distance from home.
