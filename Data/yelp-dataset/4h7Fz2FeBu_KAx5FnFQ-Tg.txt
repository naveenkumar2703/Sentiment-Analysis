2	This was my first time here.  I tried the chicken salad sandwich.  The sandwich was very bland and terribly depressing.  I can't believe it.  I was so excited to try this place, especially after reading some of the reviews about the location on State St.  Wrong sir wrong!!  The interior of this location was pretty darn cool and comfy, and the staff was very friendly, but the sandwich reminded me of something you'd get out of a hospital cafeteria.  Blech.  Craptacular.
3	Potbelly makes good but messy sandwiches. Service is good and its fast.
4	My daughter's favorite!  Healthy food served here without a healthy price.  I eat there often and will continue to do so.
5	Love their sandwiches, Mediterranean & the wreck are my favorites. Great place.
1	First trip here food was very bland and the overall conditions were horrible. Tables were nasty fountain drink machine had not been cleaned in what looked like forever 1/2 or the drinks were empty. It would be a good place for a sandwich shop for sure is only positive thing I can truly say
4	Great Sandwiches - Just okay service.Let me preface this review by saying that I recently moved back to the Madison area from Chicago, where I lived within walking distance of a Potbelly and ate there way more often than I really should admit. While pregnant with my second child I probably ate there twice a week.  What can I say?  I'm a little obsessed. Their sandwiches are great. Their salads are great. Their soup is great. Their shakes - you guessed it, great. ;)  All that being said, the East Side location needs to step up their game a bit.  I've eaten there a few times and a) it took FOREVER to get my sandwich - I think I could have probably jumped behind the counter and made it faster and b)I've had a few errors with my meal...things forgotten, ingredients incorrect, etc.  So - 4 stars it is - because bad service or not, I'd still eat there twice a week if I lived closer!
