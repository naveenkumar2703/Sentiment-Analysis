5	Seriously this has to be the best yoga studio in the valley. The studio is immaculate and they have a variety of classes throughout the day. The staff really embraces the philosophy behind yoga. Instructors are knowledgeable and help provide alternate poses for those with injuries or other limitations. They've been open for over a year, and I think it's a hidden gem. I definitely recommend Yoga Because.
5	Excellent teachers and offer a variety of yoga styles.   Beautiful studio and great props for use during class.
5	This hidden-away studio is definitely worth a visit.  The instructors are all wonderful, but I particularly enjoy Stephanie's Hot and Holy yoga on Friday nights.  It is a killer workout, challenging, and so inspirational.  I pass a number of other yoga studios on my drive to this one, and I will continue to do so.  They are wonderful!
