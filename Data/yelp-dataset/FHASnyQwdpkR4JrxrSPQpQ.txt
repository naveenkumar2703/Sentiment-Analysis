2	Everyone that walks in that door should work here. If you need help just wait for that little bell to jingle when someone walks in because that's who is going to help you. The have the workers disappearing to the back of the store. Maybe a secret salon back there who knows.. they pretend to be stocking when the shelves are full. What's up with that??? Hey how about stocking some helpful employees? No scratch that stock some Mr Pumice you seem to never have that.
1	The service is terrible but I put up with it because I like Sally's products. There have been a few times I've seen the customers walk out upset due to mistreatment. Customer service definitely needs to be worked on. One of the older woman working there seems to be nice to me but treats other ethnicities with a little sass. Secret Shoppers needs to frequent this place because I hear from a lot of my friends the same thing. Not a pleasant place to shop but it gets the job done. I don't like unfair treatment, whether it's me who's being mistreated or not. I truly want to like this place because I've been a Sally's customer for years. The service is just really bad. I stick to online shopping at Sally's now for the most part. I like that I can use a good amount of coupon codes as well.
1	I was at this Sally's 3 different times and oh my god the people working there are soooo rude!!!! Even the manager is rude! I think she's  even more rude than everyone else there!! I was there yesterday an I got the same shitty service!!  Never going back! I rather drive few extra miles to another Sally's ....
