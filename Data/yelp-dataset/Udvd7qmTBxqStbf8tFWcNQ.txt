1	To start off with, the waiting room was dirty!! The receptionist was sloppy looking and slurped her cup of coffee. When I filled out paper work she said if you want you can take a copy of our policy and didn't offer one. She was not professional!! The exam room was also messy. The MA that took my info was okay. My appt. was at 9 still sitting her waiting to see the dr!! He has taken patients who came in after me first! No one has come in to tell me that they are waiting for paperwork, I had to ask!! I'm so mad right now it's not even funny!! I've waited before in a dr's office but never like this!! Plus to add icing on the cake, the MA left to get keys made instead of pushing to get the paper work!! WOW!!!  I'm very disappointed!! I work in the medical field and this is uncalled for and unprofessional!!!
1	Not one other patient was in the lobby and I sat in the office for literally over 30 minutes before they asked me to fill out paperwork. Took an extra 40 minutes for me to be taken back for my urinalysis and TB test. Definitely do not recommend. Employees pay no attention to time or amount of people in waiting room.
