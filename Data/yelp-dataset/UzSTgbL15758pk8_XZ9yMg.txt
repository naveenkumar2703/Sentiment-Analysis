4	'Wow, you make this stuff yourself' I uttered to Joey D after having a peek at his self made edgy urban garments. The clothes here are recycled from vintage clothing and unusual materials resulting in some truly original clothing.It's a marmite affair, though, some items will either inspire you or have you wincing at the thought of donning such attire.Joey, the designer and shop owner is a charming and inviting chap an undoubtedly after having a chat with this talented fellow his enthusiasm will rub off onto you, persuading you to consider buying some of the unique styles on offer. A great alternative to the mainstream clothing shops.

The stuff they stock here is definitely not for the mainstream high street shopper, and more for the 'Kate Moss ain't got sh*t on me, I set my own trends' sort of people. In other words, it's a bit of an acquired taste. A lot of the stuff you look at, and even though you think it looks ok, you can't think of a single time in anyone's life where it would be appropriate to wear it.Don't get me wrong, it's a great place to go and have a browse even if it's not on your way or you're not in the area. It's jut that, in my case, I definitely am one of those boring people who's perfectly fine with what Princes Street has to offer.
