4	One of the best cab rides I've ever had with very knowledgeable cabbies and the prices are not thru the roof.
3	Decent cab service with OK prices... for Vegas. The driver was fairly entertaining but couldn't drive worth a damn. It was a short trip to the airport, and he hooked me up with extra receipts to cover up the drinking expenses on the business trip, which is always nice ;)
1	All cab drivers are sneaky..we had our phone GPS on during our ride and he went the long way..we made it back quicker on the bus later that night.
