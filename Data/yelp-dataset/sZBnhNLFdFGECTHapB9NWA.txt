4	Love the butcher at this Safeway!!!Reminds me of the butcher at the grocer we went to when I was growing up. He knows everything about every cut of meat, including the best ways to cook them...and will take the time to talk to you about it. I told him about something that hadn't turned out quite right the last time I made it -- he gave me a tip and it turned out melt-in-your-mouth perfectly. So besides the fact that this Safeway has the same women's health mix that I used to have to drive to Scottsdale to get from Whole Foods or the fact that they have other specialty items that are cheaper than going to AJ's, it's worth the drive to Vistancia just to visit the butcher.
5	I love Safeway! They have clean upscale stores all over the valley. I recently moved and Safeway is the closest grocer and I couldnt be more happy. This one is located between my kids school and home. Perfect for stopping in for any dinner items needed! Starbucks inside, staff is helpful and the floral department is always beautiful!
1	If you like long lines and awful customer service this is the store for you.  Plus if you want a drink at their Starbucks, and dont mind waiting at least 15 for the guy to make your drink.  Then you truly have a store that fits your every need.  Wish it wasn't the only grocery store close to me
