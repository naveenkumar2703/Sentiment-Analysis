1	I have never been laughed at by a salesperson! I'm not sensitive, I am a seasoned western rider and am shocked at the lack of knowledge and customer service this place has.

They have much more fashionable stuff than the boot barn, and the guy working there helped me pick out a nice pair that wasn't like a lot of the others. Good job!
