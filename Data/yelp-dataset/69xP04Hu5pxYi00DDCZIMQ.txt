5	Friendly staff and I never have to wait.  prices are very affordable and everyone is a friend.  Love it.
1	So disappointed. I'm new to the area and very excited to see a salon close to my house. On my first visit I was passed from one technician to another and then overcharged but the work was good, the technicians were at least friendly.   I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I went back yesterday and the young lady at the front apparently was upset that I didn't want a pedicure "just a fill" so she informed me what I would be having done instead of asking me, was so rushed that I felt like my fingers were on fire from the drill. I finally had to stop her because she was being so rough. When it became apparent that she had no intention of doing a proper job I left.  Definitely will not go back, nor would I recommend.
5	Was in town visiting family and had to see what the hype was about from my friend. This place is very clean. Nice and quiet. Friendly staff. Pauline is the owner, does really good on eyebrows, and excellent on manicures. Took my mom to get permanent tattoo on her eyebrows and they came out fantastic. Prices are very affordable. The staff is also very reliable.
1	This business changed hands and is not the same. I wanted an appointment with Diane for a pedicure but they seemed very evasive and kept suggesting I "come in and they would take care of me". I found out later that Diane was fired!  I'm so glad I found her at Encore Nails!
