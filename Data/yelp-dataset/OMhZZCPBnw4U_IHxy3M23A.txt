5	They generally have a good selection, a mid-size organic food and products area, fresh produce, great layout and a very reasonable range of products, which means that unless you're really in search of a specialty item, this can be a one-stop shop for groceries--with a few yummy, new discoveries thrown in. It is always clean and nicely merchandised, with friendly staff.
3	The produce here isn't nearly as good as at the St. Jacob's farmer's market, which isn't far away by car, but it's better than Sobey's.  If St. Jacob's is not open for the day, then I go to Herrle's country farm market (open 7 days in season) to get super-fresh produce.
5	Best supermarket in town.  Selection is great and everything is fresh, more than sobeys
4	The Beechwood Zehrs is great.  I remember coming here early in the morning when it was open 24 hours, but it doesn't open past 11 pm anymore.  What this Zehrs gets right is the service.  Always courteous and helpful, I have always been able to find what I am looking for.  The selection of local produce (when in season) and organic products is reasonable (but not as good as other local places).  I would do all my shopping here (and where the place loses a star) if it were not for the prices of many standard items.  Getting our groceries here instead of at a discount grocery store like Freshco or Food Basics will often raise my grocery bill by 50% if we're not careful to buy certain items elsewhere or wait for a sale.
2	Every time I go here I regret it because the vegetables are such awful quality. They're always limp and look like they've been sitting out for a few days!
