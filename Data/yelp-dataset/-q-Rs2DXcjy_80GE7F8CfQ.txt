3	Southside Pharmacy is a... well a Pharamcy in the Southside. It's hard for a phamacy to stand out and the Southside isn't exactly spectacular but it serves its purpose and does it well.This is a handy little pharmacy near the centre of town, especially good as its nice to shop somewhere which isn't Boots or Superdrug. When I went in for  the first time for my Heyfever medicine the staff were very considerate and friendly.It offers usual extra pharmacy servies like passport photography. It also sells cards and bits and bobs making it feel almost like a mini-post office. Unfortunetly it also has what appears to be a 99p shop attached. This makes the place seem a touch tacky but presumably this in understandable attempt to make some extra money and compete with the big names.
3	This place does the trick and has a pharmacy, which is what I was looking for. That said, it feels (and smells) old and musty, and doesn't have the clean, fresh ambiance desired. The staff weren't that friendly at first but then, when it was quieter, they became more friendly when I picked up my prescription. This isn't my top choice for a pharmacy, but it's fine in a bind.
