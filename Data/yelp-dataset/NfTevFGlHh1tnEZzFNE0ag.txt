4	$19 hair cut, with free shoulder massage. Best cut I have had in an age. If you are sick of salon prices this is the place to go.
4	Great haircut! Great price, too. I was on vacation and needed a quick cut. Its next to a coffee shop. The barbers are really friendly. Worth looking up!
4	Both Sam and Olga do an excellent job. They are veterans. They take appointments.
5	Well, this is like finding the end of the rainbow - yes this is a pot of gold barbers shop.Ultimate service, great conversation, and they can cut hair better than anywhere else in the valley.I suggest some of the so called upmarket Scottsdale hairdressers visit Sam's to experience real good old fashion customer service..
