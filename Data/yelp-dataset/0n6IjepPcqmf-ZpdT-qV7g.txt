1	Yes, please take me to a bar where they play music at a 7 year lag and the bartenders have more testosterone than my old high school gym teacher.  Exactly the atmosphere I want to enter on a Friday night.

2	I'll give Madison's an extra star for it's Happy Hour. It's kind of an okay place to hang after work and get some nachos and a pretty decent martini (it is a vodka bar after all). Come here at night, however, and it's a middle aged, middle America nightmare. Be sure you're good and trashed before you come in here, otherwise you will not have fun. I try not to stay in here long, but my instincts tell me this is a cougar pit.
1	This place would be at home in a mall...any mall, around the world.  Its a tragic use of what could be an incredible space.  But I'm sure you can drink and eat reasonably here...but is that really what you're looking for?
