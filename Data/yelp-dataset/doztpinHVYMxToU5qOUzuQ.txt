5	A friend of mine has her hair done here and loves the place. I was looking to get a retro-pinup style done and her stylist recommended Girard who works in the salon. He called me back shortly after I left him a voicemail and was able to book an appointment for me on the specific day I needed. Since we had never met,  I loved that he asked me specific questions about my hair type, what kind of style I was looking for, even to text him a photo of what I was going to be wearing. I was immediately impressed.The salon is gorgeous. A very cool downtown loft where the owners live upstairs and the salon is on the first floor. Cool art hangs of the concrete walls and a teal couch serves as the waiting and stylist-consult area. We looked online for some examples and Girard went to work. Not only did he give me a beautiful style, but he managed to make my otherwise fine, hard-to-hold-a-curl-hair, stay put all night!! That's pure hair engineering if I ever saw it!Great experience! Thank you!!
5	I managed to find Samantha after having a fantastic cut from her a while back (so good that I literally had some dude at a stop light roll down his window to tell me that my hair looked great:-) when she was at a different salon. I was so happy to find her at Medusa, where she is the owner. The space is really cool - relaxing and a good vibe - and Samantha rocks! She does a seriously awesome job, and is able to predict what you are looking for - an intuitive stylist, I guess you could say. I left with a great cut, and was just really happy to have managed to locate her. She is fantastic - highly recommended!
