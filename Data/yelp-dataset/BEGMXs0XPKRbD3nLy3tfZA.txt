4	I've been a patient of for close to 2 years now.  Very pleased w/ this office and their professionalism.  I highly recommend if you are looking for a good primary care physician.
5	I have been going to this practice for over 10 years now. In the past I may have had some bad things to say as far as the long waits and other petty criticisms. Now that I have gotten to know all of the doctors and nurse practitioners I have seen that this practice really works hard to please their patients. On behalf of my care I have absolutely nothing negative to say about any of the health care providers. The nurse practitioner Neerja is by far my first choice to be seen by and then I would say dr schlotterback. If you are looking for a family dr I highly recommend Gilbert center for family medicine.
5	I had a great experience here. Everyone was very nice and helpful. I made an appointment with Neerja, one of the physicians assistants because I needed an appointment quickly, but I may make all of my appointments with her from now on. Neerja was incredibly understanding and truly listened to what I was telling her. Because she listened I feel confident that she made a thoughtful diagnosis and I rarely find that with doctors these days. I will use this practice from now on for my primary care needs! I also love that you can fill out all of your new patient forms online before your appointment, that greatly reduced my wait time as a new patient.
