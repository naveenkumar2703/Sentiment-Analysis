5	not only did they have a mukiltio faires seven inch that I didn't know existed but they had a booker t and the mg's record that I have been looking for ever since I got to Arizona. plus, i'm assuming they based their name off of the minutemen's double nickels on the dime record.
5	The new Eastside Records, absolutely the only place to shop for records in Phoenix.  Extremely knowledgeable staff that remembered me even though I hadn't been in a couple years.  Selection and prices are great from rare punk and jazz to regular old classics.  Ask to see the Tago Mago Can opener behind the counter, awesome.
5	This is my favorite shop in Phoenix. It houses Eastside Records and many(10?) other vendors in the same vein as Crossroads in Portland. They've got tons of new/used records, tapes, audio gear, clothing and books. For the most part though, it is a record store with a great selection and good prices. I would say that the majority of the records are used, but they also have good new releases and reissues. The Punk, Jazz and Reggae sections are huge compared with anyone else in town. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and there's always new stuff in the new arrivals bin when I stop by.
5	I love this place! a little slice of heaven. really the best shop in town!
