Mark was very informative and provided great insight about the different area's in town. He found a place for us within a week!!! He gave us a ton of options and was very helpful. I highly recommend working with Mark Marcus! He is very committed to his work and very good at it. You can't put a price on a trustworthy Realtor who truly wants the best for you. Great experience!!!
5	Can't say enough good things about Mark!  He has nothing but clients interest in mind. We started working with Mark just a couple weeks before needing to find a place, and he found us the perfect place in just a week! He is very knowledgable and maintains great communication! He always kept us informed on new potential places and kept our interest in mind.  I would recommend him to anyone and will definitely use him I the future!
