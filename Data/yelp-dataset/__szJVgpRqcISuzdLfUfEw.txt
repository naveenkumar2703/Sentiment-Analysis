4	Fiddlesticks Scottsdale has similar attractions as the Tempe location, and opother amusement parks -- mini-golf, go-karts, bumper boats, batting cages, an arcade, and a snack bar. But Fiddlesticks Scottsdale ALSO has Atlantis Laser Odyssey - a two-story laser-tag maze. Also, Scottsdale has a 7-ride Kiddie Land including "Rookie" go-karts, roller coaster, and bumper cars. A genuine fun time!
3	Growing up in Scottsdale, I attended many a birthday party or orthodontist party (Dr. Steig anyone?) at this place.  It was always a fun time with the mini golf, bumper boats, arcade games, and the go-karts.  The laser tag was pretty awesome as well despite my lack of skill, haha.  This is a good place to take the kids during the cooler months of the year, as a lot of the attractions are outdoors.  It's good....not great, but good.
