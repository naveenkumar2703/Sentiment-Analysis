4	From curb this plase looks like any other run down Mexican street food spot. Once you step inside it is anything but. The two ladies in the kitchen were friendly and efficient. The place smelled clean and of fresh cooked tortillas. I ordered three tacos and a jarritos orange soda the total came to six bucks (little spendy). One of the ladies brought out fresh cilantro, onions, limes, and radishes as well as thee kinds of salsa!!! The meat was savory and the tortillas fresh made. I will definatly be back!
5	This is the real deal...authentic Mexican food!! If you've been craving real street tacos, this is the place! Exceptional food, great service and awesome prices! Everything was fresh, from the tortillas to the meat to the guacamole and salsa!
5	Best pork burritos...ever
5	Oh my best tacos al pastor.  That's is the one place, I have to visit when I visit my parents in AZ. I have had pretty much everything in the menu, and everything is really good.  My favorite however is the tacos al pastor with homemade tortillas.
5	From the looks of the outside you might hesitate and turn around and leave but I'm telling you the food is amazing!  By far the best Mexican food in town!
5	This place has great and delicious food. The owner is very friendly and always makes customers feel welcome.
5	The place is clean. Great food flavor, made to order. I wasn't fortunate enough to taste the homemade tortillas mentioned in other reviews. I will be back next time I'm in Mesa.
5	By far the best El Pastor taco I've ever had.  Also had the flautas. Delicious!  Will definitely be going back.
