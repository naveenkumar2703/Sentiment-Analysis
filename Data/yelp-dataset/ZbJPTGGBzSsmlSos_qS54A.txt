5	Great complex for soccer
3	This place is part of the greater Reach 11 facility and it is FANTASTIC!  Lots of sports and events here from soccer to field hockey to pee wee foot ball and lacrosse.  They have great grass and a synthetic field.  Lots of trails for hiking and the facilities (bathrooms etc) are all clean.  Come check out the Reach 11 park system!
5	Went there a few years ago for their inception/ opening ceremony. I happened to talk with then Mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon and then one key staff member about all the possibilities for multiple sports.Quite impressed as to how willing they were to listen and act on various things.Now Reach 11 has taken on a full fledged multi sports complex stature that embraces all people in their passion for sports in general and the health benefits it brings to both young and old. Hoping a major event will be hosted here in the future.Great and unique massive complex!Easy to access off the 101 fwy/Cave Creek Rd. exit. Highly recommend it!
3	Good place to watch youth soccer. Fields are always in good condition, the only drawback is the location which is way north for me given that I live in Chandler. I hope they try and expand the playground/ kid area for the little ones.This would make it even better for families given that the current area provided gets overwhelmed during tournaments.  They could have also be more creative/ family friendly when designing the bathrooms.  Lots of possibilities to do it better.
