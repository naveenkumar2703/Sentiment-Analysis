1	Its a shame the staff Dr Agarwal chooses to surround himself with a staff  that is so incompetent! He is a great doctor but his staff is unorganized, untrained, and the office is a complete NIGHTMARE.  Tried to speak with the office manager Chris about my concerns but she became defensive, unprofessional, and did not care to look into any of the facts presented. The unreturned phone calls, seeing a PA rather than a doctor as requested, billing issues, and being left on hold for a half hour while I was asking if I should bring my child to the emergency room so the nurse could finish giving shots to another patient was too much. Love the doctor, but the staff is ruining Dr Agarwals practice.
5	We switched to Agave Pediatrics after a terrible experience somewhere else. I'm so to see a few bad reviews about it because my husband and I LOVE it! Dr Agarwal has been so funny and personable with us and our newborn boy. He was recommended to us by the hospital because he is known for tongue and lip tie procedures and our boy had both. We went for the procedure and never left! We were told we would have to wait a week to have our insurance verify that our procedure was covered but the office manager, who had overheard our issue, said not to worry about it and she figured it out so we could come the next day. We almost always have a copay but it's totally worth it to be at such a nice place with great staff. We love it here. Not to mention the office feels like Disneyland. It's decorated so well and I know our son will leave happy each time when he is older.
