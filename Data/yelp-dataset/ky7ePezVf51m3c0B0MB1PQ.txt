5	Lars is very friendly and really knows what he is talking about. Keys don't always seem to be a big deal, so why not just have one made at Home Depot, right? Well, I have had keys made at Home Depot, and sometimes they work, and sometimes they don't. When you get a key at The Locke Shoppe, it always works. I have had a perfect track record there.As a business owner, I can also have non-duplicatable keys made there so I know my employees won't be duplicating my keys, too.I also like the fact that in The Locke Shoppe, I can find almost anything related to home and business security. They do vaults, safes, security systems, keypad entry, biometrics. Everything. I can even get a wine bottle lock to keep the kids out! Prices are great too!I whole-heartedly recommend doing business with The Locke Shoppe. Especially if honesty and integrity are important to you.
5	Lars is great.  Very responsive and helpful.  Really puts the client first, made suggestions to improve my security with minimal addition cost.
5	Timely: Lars was @ my apartment 30-40 minutes after calling him, which I appreciated as it was 6:30pm and he was probably at home already.He opened the car without any damage to the door or window in about 3 or 4 minutes.His price is competitive with other locksmiths.Lars is a friendly guy and did not seem inconvenienced by my late call.  Unfortunately, I win the Darwin award for the year as the key was actually in my pocket, not in the car.
5	I gave The Locke Shoppe a call a second time because I had locked myself out of my apartment. About 30-40 minutes later, Lars arrived and was able to open the door quickly, even offering to turn my door handle right-side-up, and gave me some advice as how to keep the locks in top condition.Great service!
