1	i am not making a review on this particular branch. i am making a review on wells fargo home mortgage wherever they may be. i called for information regarding a new home purchase, getting a loan for a home. not too difficult to understand. i had to repeat this to the woman 4 times. she kept saying, ok so you want to refinance? no, i want to apply for a mortgage. she said, ok, so you want to pay off your mortgage? no, again, i had to repeat 4 times, how simple can it be.  I want to apply for a new mortgage. she sat there laughing, talking to the person next to her then she transferred me to someone who is suppose to be a loan officer. this guy kept quoting me wrong downpayment amounts, wrong interest rates, and just all wrong information regarding their different loan packages. i work in the real estate industry. i'm very familiar with the loan process. so he was a useless moron who tried connecting me to someone else. i just hung up. i've also dealt with wells fargo, again, not this branch but wherever their home mortgage company is... i've dealt with these people over and over and over for 5 months. they kept losing all of the documents i faxed and emailed to them. i had confirmation they received all of the documents. for 4 months, i dealt with these inexperienced people and their unbelievable demands. after 5 months, i got absolutely nowhere with them. they made one mistake after another. i sent 2 documents to them 14 times. i would stay away from anything to do with a wells fargo home mortgage. i would rate them below a 1 star if i could.
