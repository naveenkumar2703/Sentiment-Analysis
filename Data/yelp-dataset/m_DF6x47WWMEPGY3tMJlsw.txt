4	Was easy to get gas, lots of pump, on the way as it were and they have a car wash plus nicer convenience store layout than most. It is easy to get to if you are traveling South on Rainbow, but not so much if you're headed North.There is an area after the car wash to get your exterior dried by hand towel. Additionally, there is a smog booth and a several car bay service shop to get oil changes and light car work done.
2	Aside from Popeye's Fried Chicken in the same building and the plethora of coffee airpots, it is difficult to justify a higher rating. Prices for gasoline and everything else including juice, water, beer, and snacks are just too high. Plus, the entire time I was in the store, the cashier was chatting with her buddy standing at the counter bad mouthing former employees or current managers. A real bad karma feel.
1	Pumps would not work with our mastercard. Went down the street to a different station, and they worked fine.
3	Car wash is good but the dryer is horrible. Otherwise this would be my favorite wash in town
3	Eh, it's a gas station and there was nothing special about it. Gas here is $.08 more than anywhere else right around there but it has an easy entry way from both badura and rainbow.
