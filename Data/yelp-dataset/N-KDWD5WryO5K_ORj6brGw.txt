5	I love Chiefs tavern its kinda like home. You can walk in have a beer have a burger, and chill. The bartenders are laid back and down to earth! The food is pretty awesome considering this chill atmosphere they serve quite a selection of upscale bar food. Ex: reuben sandwhiches, salmon burgers, TLT ( tomato Lettuce Bacon and smoked trout sandwich, chiefs chicken sandwich, burgers, steak sandwich, Gyros. they serve fresh non fried food which is a nice change for a bar.
4	Stopped in on a Friday night and we were treated to live music at a shocking 6:30 p.m. startup time! I tried the smoked trout sandwich, which also has bacon. So if you want an overdose of smoked goodness, this is a safe bet. The menu is extremely small, but well done. During busy times some patience will be needed, but it is worth it. Good beers on tap, and a very clean place. It reminds me of when I was growing up and people would turn their basements into bars and host their friends. We will be back, hopefully for the Sunday blues jam.
4	I go here after my golf league every week and get consistently great service. Regulars are friendly and the place is comfortable, although a little small when the karaoke crowd gets in. Limited menu, but what's on it is great. Try the TLT (trout, lettuce, tomato) w/ Bacon. You'll love it and if you really like trout, tell them to leave the skin on. It takes it to another level.
4	Nearly the best tap list in town. Very towny but not unwelcoming. Great for watching sports. Check out a meat raffle, it won't disappoint.
