(I forgot her name)... will be stopping by that store soon though... it's Movado, how can you not!EDIT: (5/23/07)today i went to the costa mesa store and ran into one of the associates for the las vegas store who informed me that the japanese woman is no longer working there *SNIFFLE SNIFFLE*BUT the associate i did talk to today (MICHELLE NISSAN)... she's helpful, friendly, easy going..... and even though theres a movado here in costa mesa, i think i will continue to visit the las vegas store =)============EDIT: 2/2008so the associate michelle nissan is the BOMB. i kept receiving notes from FEDEX saying i had a package and it required a signature. well it turns out michelle sent me a package for the latest catalogs! thanks girlie! i haven't had much time to get to the store, so this was so helpful..... =)
5	This is a must stop for me when I am in Vegas. This store is so much larger than ours in CO. The staff is always friendly, and it seems I can't walk in without getting something! I love their jewelry! It is hard to find. Can't even get it on the internet.
4	I was looking for a new watch... but honestly, and more importantly, I was looking for a deal.  After some negotiating, we came to an agreement... and they even suggested I have the watch shipped (on their dime, of course) to me in AZ so I could avoid paying NV sales tax.  Overall, I felt very good about the price I paid for the timepiece and the experience.
