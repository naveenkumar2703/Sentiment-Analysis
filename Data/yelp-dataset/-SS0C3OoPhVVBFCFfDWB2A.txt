4	I normally get the steak Carne Asada Taco's and let me tell you they ROCK!!! You get a plate of three tacos with some chips, beans or rice and  with a drink for about $5-6 bucks. Great stomach filler for cheap. And hey pop a few coins into the jukebox while you wait for some interesting looks haha ;)
4	Taco Trio of beef pork and chicken, rice and beans. Man that was some good grub. I preferred the pork. Try it.
2	Pretty blah, really.  It's fast food but with sit down prices and barely fast food taste.The taco platter Jesse mentioned, is three street tacos on a styrofoam plate which has other little compartments filled with a a few spoonfuls of rice, beans, avocado sauce, and chopped lettuce.  They sprinkle a handful of chips over the top.The meat isn't char grilled, but steamed on a flat-top and is greasy/wet enough that the little tortillas break apart before you get halfway through the first one.  I ended up dumping the mix into a pile, tossing the tortillas, and eating it like cereal.  Not horrible, but also not worth the price.  The combos are $6.75 and drinks are extra ($2). so for $9 you get a pretty weak meal compared with other good/cheap Mexican places or decent sit down joints with service.
3	This place has decent prices and good tacos.  I get the 3 taco meal.  I think the pork is awesome.  Tacos come on corn enchilada shells (a plus in my book) and are served with refried beans and rice.  They offer a choice of green or red salsa.  I had the red it was mild/mediumish  in strength.  Tacos are served with salsa and onions with lettuce and tomato given in a bed underneath.  Great food - Very filling.I would recommend trying it if in the area!A-OK grub.
