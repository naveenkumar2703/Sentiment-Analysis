2	How about NOT So Yummy Buffet?  I added this hole in the wall Chinese buffet located off State Street just because I wanted to highlight how clever and witty I can be.  But really you honestly get what you pay for.  FIVE BUCKS for all you can eat and all the soda refills you want.  I mean you could probably camp out here from lunch until dinner with your textbooks (although I probably wouldn't recommend it).  I do take my freshman brother here frequently because he eats like a horse--seriously he does.  After a nice dining here for almost an hour (me for the most part watching him grub) as we were walking down State he demanded we go to Taco Bell to get something there as well.  Wow....wow.
1	This place is the perfect example of what a typical Midwestern all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet is -- A greasy, cheap, and really disgusting dump. Despite being known as Madison's worst Chinese restaurant, the place generates quite a lot of business. There's some people who'll happily pay $5 and not complain -- I've noticed that college students will eat practically anything as long as it's cheap and for some others, it's a guilty pleasure. Me? I wouldn't take the risk... unless I was really drunk or had to accompany a stoner friend or something.
1	The word is that the Yummy actually had a grease fire in the kitchen, and then the health department got involved and shut it down. Regardless, this restaurant no longer exists. Thankfully.
1	$5 all you can eat 2 week old Chinese leftovers.  Or that's what it tastes like anyway. Yummy.
