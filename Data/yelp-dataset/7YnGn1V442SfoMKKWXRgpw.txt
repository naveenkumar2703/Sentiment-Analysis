4	This is not your typical mall food.  Tomatoes features delicious sandwiches, salads, pastas and burgers.  Their fries are some of the best I have ever had.  I have not tried their desserts but they always look great.  They have different salads everyday that are fresh and delicious.
5	That place had great food especially great burgers! Too bad it closed! Not sure if they were going to to re-open some where else???
