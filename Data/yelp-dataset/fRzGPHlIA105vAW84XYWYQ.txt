5	Good food. Good drinks, and good company.
4	This bar is old, run down, beat up, and just plain awesome! Think "Cheers." The people here are extremely friendly. Everyone treats you like family. This is a place you could go to solo and yet you won't be alone. The food selection is amazing for bar food but the kitchen is not always open. The alcohol is low cost and if you play your cards right a "regular" might even show you the trick on how to get the quarter in the shot glass t the bottom of the fish tank to win a beer. (It took me one try.) The downside is that this is a membership bar. You will either need to be military, former military, or an invitee of a member to go inside. Expect to pay about $60 a year to maintain membership.
4	Folks here are very friendly, felt like home.  Drink prices are always good at an ALP.
