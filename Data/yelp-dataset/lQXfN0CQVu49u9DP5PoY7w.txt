5	I've never been to the new shop (can't wait!) but I have been ordering from Susan for years. The irony being that I'm not that much into yoga but I am into the clothes! Generous sizing, pretty prints and gorgeous fabrics makes Yoga Styles a go to for me. Customer service is top notch too. I'm so glad I stumbled upon the store.
5	Susan gets the business of great clothes.  I've been wearing her products for years.  They are fashionable, versatile, and long lasting.  I use them mostly for fashion and only occasionally for yoga.  Her service is outstanding and she is always honest and delightful (yes, both at the same time!).  Check out yoga styles today!
5	I met Susan a few years ago when I was drawn into her space at a yoga festival and I bought some beautiful clothes. Everything I bought is still in heavy rotation, I often get complimented on her designs. She's always is always available if you want to follow up.
5	Yoga Styles rock!  Susan has created gorgeous and functional custom products for my acu-wellness practice/business...she is a creative genus...easy to talk too and always willing to try something...I love my Yoga Styles products...and am grateful for Susan Nichols!
5	Yoga style clothes are not just for yoga, they also have many pieces that are great for every day wear and special occasion as well.  The jewelry is beautiful with many different items for every taste.  The clothing lasts forever, is well made, and fun.  She always has new styles and colors and is always working on new creative designs.  I love visiting her booth and always come away with lots of great new exercise and every day wear.
5	Love my yoga styles clothing !! I wear them with comfort & they have the relaxed classy style I love.  Some pieces are 3-4 years old & still in great shape ! Highly recommending
