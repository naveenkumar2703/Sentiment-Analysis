5	I had a window broken in but didn't see it until I arrived home late, about 8pm. I called five or six companies and no one wanted to come out to replace it. Juan Bellesteros, who owns J.B.L. GLASS & MIRROR COMPANY was all to happy to come out immediately during my time of need. He came to the home, removed the frame, and took it back to his shop. He returned within an hour! With a brand new, double pane window that was more reasonable than other estimates who priced it out for the next day, using their normal business hourly rate! He was the nicest, honest, and detail oriented glass specialist I've ever dealt with. Ever. I know he was busy on the Friday night when I called. It says alot about a person when they drop their personal life to take care of their customers. Thanks so much Juan! Joe
5	Called them Monday evening and they said that they could come out Tuesday to give an estimate. Juan came out, he is also the owner. He is EXTREMELY nice, soft spoken, not pushy like so many people here in town. I called him later that evening after having another company out for an estimate. Juan was just barely cheaper than the others, but definitely reasonable. Now it is Thursday, the glass was installed by Juan and I would definitely use him again AND I would recommend him to anyone else that needs a glass replaced. Mine was a cracked window so wasn't so much an emergency. But if you want a great company with great people, this is the company for you.
5	You can't find a better place than this one!  Went there today for a small piece of plate glass.  Quick and efficient response to my needs. Fast, friendly, and reasonably priced services.  Try them before you go to any others.  Juan is great, and so is his office worker Cynthia.  I promise you'll be  happy!
