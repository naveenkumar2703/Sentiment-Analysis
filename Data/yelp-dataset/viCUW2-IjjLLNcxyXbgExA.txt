1	Just passing through town,stopped in to get a pedicure and got the women from hell with a bad attitude.  down right rude customer service skills. don't have her redo anything cause she will get mean and nasty with you. it was just one lady here who was the rotten apple, wish I could remember her name.but the other people that work there know who she is.. should have gone to Valley Nails in Mesa that was recommend by a lady from the hotel.
4	Very nice people, very good service! Thank you! I will be back!
5	This place gets a bad rap. I have gone for years to several waaay more expensive salons for my pedis. And my feet always look crappy after a week. Got hot stone with paraffin and callous remover and this lady... The owner really went to town. My feet look and more importantly have stayed amazing. Don't believe the bad  reviews. Try it for yourself. Great pedicure for a great price...Ask for the owner lady to do your pedicure, she puts all others to shame. Don't believe the bad reviews............it ain't so.
