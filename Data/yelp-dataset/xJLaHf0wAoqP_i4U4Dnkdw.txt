4	They have best brewed coffee ever!  Try kona coffee.
3	This particular gas station is hard to get in to.  Their gas prices are a little bit more than the other stations in the area and only have a few pumps.  When you have no other choice and are out of gas, this is the place to stop.  Good luck getting back on the main road.
4	I always go to this Shell station on the way back home to LA. It's just really convenient for me because you can head straight onto the freeway from here.And they don't charge you for cups of ice! Just for future reference if you're here on warmer days.
2	It's a gas station, what can I say?  The reason I gave only two stars is because the pumps are oriented at an angle that is hard to pull into.  We had to do like a six point turn to get close enough to the pump.
4	Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #152 - #365Oh how I love Shell gas, especially when I'm driving long back and forth to California. I want premium gas that will last me longer on the road compared to Arco.Since I'm always staying on the strip, I always stop here to fill up before the long drive back to California. What I also love is that it's way cheaper than Socal gas because Nevada doesn't add that much taxes to the gasoline. The store has an abundance of cheap drinks compared to the strip, so it's great to stock up before heading back to the hotel. I have never had a problem with the staff and are all smiles. This is my Go To place for gas!
