5	This place us now located in las Vegas near silverado high school . It's the best small kenpo , jiu jitsu , kickboxing gym in town . It's family owned and they are very good instructors
1	They put an advertisement on my car door window while I was in the movie theater. I removed the annoying ad, open my car, got in, and closed the door, and my window fell down. Never had any problems with my window before. The idiot who placed the flyer pushed on my window hard enough to slip it off the track. I called the company several times, and no answer. I went into the store to talk to a manager, who wasn't there, but got his phone number. I called, and the guy was a complete jerk! Refused any responsibility for any damage, and threatened to sue ME for wasting his time! I couldn't believe it! A simple 'sorry' would've been nice. I would never go to a company who treats people with such disrespect! This place is a total sham, with outrageously rude management!
1	Purchased a deal over Livingsocial. Scheduled a class at 9am which is a difficult time for me to wake up considering that I work for a nightclub on the strip. I was interested in learning Kickboxing and optimistic about my first class. However, when I arrived there were no cars around, no lights on in the studio and no sign on the door stating that it was open or closed. I waited about 15 min until 9:06 and drove away very upset. After I called back around 1pm to express my concern, the lady who answered laughed at me and wondered why I had not tried to OPEN the door. Very rude, I gave the voucher to my boyfriend since I cannot get a refund and now feel uncomfortable going back to that studio. I'll just try kickboxing at Gold Gym, thanks.
