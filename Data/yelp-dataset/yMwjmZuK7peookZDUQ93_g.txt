5	Have had two kids go through this school as well, with my son going there in 3 years.  The teachers are very active with the students, and take the time and energy to get to know their students.  Active PTO, and quite a few extra-cirricular activities as well.
4	I went to Middle School here back in the day. Although those were not the best years of my life all and all I would say DSMS is a great school. Overall I had very passionate, caring, and knowledgeable teachers who I still remember. I was very shy in those days, but now that I think back the school still got me very involved. I did orchestra, babysitters club, community service club, and a program where I aided for a teacher at the neighboring elementary school. Located in a good part of Phx/Scottsdale, the school isn't the prettiest place to look at but that doesn't reflect on the school itself!
