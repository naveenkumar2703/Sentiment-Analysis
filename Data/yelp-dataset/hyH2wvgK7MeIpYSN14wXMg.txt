4	Great local bar, with plenty of TVs, and two pool tables in fairly good shape. A great place to end your night. Only down side is there's a $20 minimum to use a credit card. But if it's your first time, they might let it slide.
2	this place was ok.. its definitely a divey bar. I cant say I'd go back anytime soon only b/c it was kinda small. Definitely a neighborhood bar where everyone in there knew each other (except me & my bf) and we could tell it was that tight knit grp since they were fully on wrestling on the floor. At times I couldnt tell if it was still playing or if testosterone had gotten the best of them. anyway it has a few pool tables off to the side and a popcorn machine on the other. its an ok place, but just kinda divey and didnt have the best tasting beer I've ever had. . (draft). tasted really watered down. If I went back I'd order bottled beer.
4	I'm a big fan of dive bars and Lucky Joe's definitely fits the bill. It's on the smaller side, always way too dark, almost always feels kind of empty, and the bartenders are always friendly. Plus, there's pool, video poker of course, and a snack machine featuring half chips and half cigarettes. Sure, this isn't a place to go out of your way for to grab a drink at, but it's a great neighborhood hangout. And the beer selection is decent.
5	Used to come here all of the time when I was living in the area. This is sort of a cross between a sports bar and a dive bar, with it being more of a dive bar. A wide variety of people come here. Sometimes you'll be hearing a conversation about the the LA Lakers on one night, and another night you'll hear one about the origins of Western philosophy. Definitely a very eclectic crowd, not just a bunch of wild party animals. The drinks are cheap and it's just a place where you can just kick back after a long day.
1	The bartender is a pease OF shit.. he tryed fighting me over a joke..  fuck that mother fucker
