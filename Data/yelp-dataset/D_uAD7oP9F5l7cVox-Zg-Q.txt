5	Whoever thought that I'd be able to find heaven in good ol', downtown Vegas? Accessed through an elevator across from the pool area in the hotel, you will find a gleaming, golden lobby with a receptionist there to greet you and check you in. After check-in, I was led to a desk where I was offered water or fruit juice, a pair of spa slippers, and a key to my locker. Inside, I found a fluffy robe to change into. The waiting room had a selection of fresh fruit to choose from, some dried fruit, as well as teas and cucumber water. I put on my swimsuit and went exploring.Steam room: Wow. That room sure was...steamy.The Sauna: Very sauna. I ended up hanging out in their very large jacuzzi. I think the sign said it accommodates something like 20+ people? or maybe it was 10. iono. it was humongous!After my explorations, I was led to the desk, where I was greeted by Mauro, who was to be my masseuse:MagicalAndUnbelievably good masseuse whoReally, really, really worksOut any kink or ache your muscles may have!I swear, it was an unbelievable experience. I read somewhere that sometimes masseuses manage to relax a person so much that the person...farts. I didn't fart, but I did finally realize how someone could start farting during a massage. So there you go.
4	Not a very large place but the services were great. I had Linda M. who was by far the best massuer I have ever had. We used a groupon so the prices were very reasonable.
