4	This is my go-to Chase. It's near home and in a shopping center I frequent. I always use the ATM for all my banking needs. I have never had a problem and like the convenience of not having to wait in a line and I can go at any hour of the day or night. When I have been inside to speak with a personal banker, I have never seen lines though! The ATM takes checks as well cash for deposit with no use of a deposit slip. YAY! It is much more convenient to just put it in the ATM instead of having to fill out a deposit slip and dreading to lick the envelope. You can choose the option to print check images on your receipt if you feel weird about just sticking money in the ATM.  Parking can be tight at certain times, but it is a busy shopping center. After hours you will need your Chase card to enter and make any type of transaction at the ATM.
5	This is my local branch and I have had nothing but good service whenever needed. The staff seem to be happy and there is not too much turnover, the ATM is in the lobby and it can accept a cash deposit in several denominations. Parking is great and it is just a couple doors from Starbucks which is my favorite morning destination.
4	I don't have an account here, but a business whose account that I pay sometimes via a  branch has their account at Chase.  This branch is so nice, and the decor is interesting.  Rather than a long counter that tellers stand behind, they have three wood "pedestal" tables. I don't know how they handle high volume. The staff are very friendly.
