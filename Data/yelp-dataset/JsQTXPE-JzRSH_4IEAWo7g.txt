4	I went to Allan a couple years ago after purchasing a groupon for a mani/pedi for Futzpah. He used to be located inside Summerlin Medical Plaza and was apart of a podiatric office. I still to this day remember what a fabulous job he did on my hands and feet. Only problem for me, it was so far away from my house, I knew I'd probably never return. Well, he has since moved into Sola Salon across from Boca Park, and has a place he calls his own now. Just like the last time, he did a great job on my nails. The place was clean, he used a brand new tool on my nails (sterile processed) and also uses he very own exfoliant that he makes with only 3 ingredients. 3 chairs available, so make sure to call and make an appt prior to coming. He does charge more than I'm used to for a pedi ($45) but I feel you get what you pay for. He has good, professional nail polish, nothing old or cracked or acetone added to thin it out. Totally recommend this place.
5	The cleanest salon you'll find!! Allen and Phyllis are the best! Very thorough pedicures that are used with the best products. Both of them are excellent people and I enjoy having conversations with them during my pedicure. They will definitely keep you entertained while giving you the finest pedicure!
4	I have a fear of being a Anjelah Johnson poster child when it comes to mani/pedi.  Absolutely not so in this case.Clean and comfortable environment, sterilized, sanitized and nice pretty pinkies at the finish line.
