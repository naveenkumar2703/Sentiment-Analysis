5	Awesome selection of cooking woods in logs chips and chunks.  An absolute must visit for anyone into outdoor cooking
5	This place has everything that an outdoor cooking enthusiast would need. From large assortments and volume of lump charcoal to flavored wood chunks, chips and logs. They also sell a limited supply of sauces and rubs as well.
5	Great for serious BBQ cookers. No better place to get supplies. If they don't have it that can usually get it.  Bring you truck because you will want to buy it all.  $18.00 for a 2 cubic foot bag of 1/2 cut logs I bought almond, peach and hickory today.  There is no other place to stock up on BBQ product in Vegas.
