3	Wow!!! This Safeway has both a Starbucks and a Jamba Juice!!! I would never see both drink places in a Safeway back in Northern California. In addition, there is also a Gelato Corner!!! MmmM.. I was tempted by the creme brulee, tiramisu, burgundy cherry, and sorbet flavors. Luckily I said "no" since that would be a unhealthy meal for lunch. If a gelato section was in my neighborhood Safeway, I would go all the time and gain 10 pounds in a year from all that gelato. Prices for gelato:+ Small : $2.99+ Regular : $3.99+ Pint: $5.49You can also get samples, but I didn't want to ask for any.
5	The Fountain Hills Safeway is the largest store in the Scottsdale area and is the most profitable. This store is about 55,000 square feet. It has a Jamba Juice, a Starbucks, a gelato bar, and you can order your own custom subs. Included in the store is a 30 person seating area equipped with Wi-Fi. They have 12 checkouts; their employees are very friendly and helpful.
5	Very nice staff, I'm going to miss it as I move a little further away. However I use the online ordering and it's great to wish other stores did this
4	Great, local grocer to fulfill my everyday needs. Always friendly service/associates to be found throughout the store. Deli is great - especially whoever roasts their Deli Chickens - yum! Produce seems to be fresh and "in-stock". Love they have Starbucks also at this location. Only drawback would be length of lines. Seems like whatever day/time I visit here, they usually are 3-4 deep at each POS. Seems excessive? I dunno.
1	Always long lines.  Service is slow.  I think the social hour should be outside on your break not when I am waiting in line.
3	Prices arent bad. The bakery makes custom cakes. I love the tres leches when they make it right. You can cash in all your coins there with their coin machine. Always get my frozen burritos there. Decent place to do your shopping at.
