4	Let me just say that my waxer Carrie gets 5 stars!  She is amazing, I've seen her twice now and I will never ever see anyone else there.  She makes me feel totally comfertable and relaxed.  I'm even going to venture to a brazilion which I've wanted for a while but been afraid of because she's amazing!As a whole I love this place the prices are geat and the service for the most part is wonderful.  I go with my mom and this last time she was with Michelle, who was lets say less then a delight!  She was rude, didn't talk at all, just in general seemed bothered by the appointment.  Also a note for the front desk, you've told me about your programs, I'm going to go home look at them see which works best for me since I'm thinking about adding some services, which I've told you.  You really don't need to harrass me about your programs 5 and 6 times it's rediculous.Over all a great salon, quality customer service just a few tips!
1	I went again last week for an appointment and I really don't think I'll be returning. Again I love Carrie she is wonderful but the front desk is annoying. Once again I was asked several times if I want a package again I said no, because with the services I get I don't save any money in fact if I miss even one appointment time I actually lose money because I pre-pay the packages. I asked her to not ask again and she said they all have to ask or they will get in trouble. It's ridiculous. I won't be returning, because I have no interest in setting myself up to be annoyed every four weeks!
5	This place is a total godsend!  I just got the best Brazilian wax here.  It was completely painless and Nicole was a total sweetheart.  The wax took about 15-20 minutes and I only cringed during one part.  That should sum up how great they are.They have this special wax that is a deep purple and works wonders.  Definitely something new and amazing!  This place is worth the drive and probably the only professional waxing salon where you can get a Brazilian for $35!  $13 for AZ residents, but I'm from CA so I missed out.  This has officially become my go to wax spot!
4	I had a really wonderful experience here. My waxing specialist was very sweet and the hard wax they use is great. For those of you who don't know what hard wax is, it is a wax that when placed on the skin hardens and they do not use a strip to remove it they are able just to rip the hardened wax off the skin...what this means for you, no sticky gross residue and a quick, sanitary, less painful wax.Bottom line: Its very sanitary, the wax is less painful and gives less ingrown hairs, and they can usually get you in on short notice...plus with all their promotional pricing what's not to like?I am super fussy when it comes to anything beauty related and I give this place my full endorsement!
4	Michelle is awesome, does awesome brows and makes you feel really comfortable !
5	Late notice, but for the month of August they are offering one service you've never had for a buck (certain services only)!This place is clean and sanitary. The workers are friendly. If you come here, I would recommend to ask for Erika.
5	Wonderful staff and very clean space.  I didn't have an appointment but they got me in for my brows within 15 minutes.  Definitely happy with the experience.  I've had work at other places and the wax left rashes and bumps, whatever this place uses is amazing!  I ended up buying a package which was a pretty decent deal.
4	Go here for all my waxing needs and they do an amazing job each time. The location is sanitary and welcoming. Each of the aestheticians is very competent and friendly. They also have very good after care products like body wash, lotion and serum which work !. I have their package which is a good deal and they always have some kind of promo pricing going on. Best part of course is the fact they use hard wax. It was a life changer for me after years of strip wax which would hurt, redden the skin and I had to be back in 3 weeks to repeat the pain. Hard wax is wax that is gel like which hardens on contact and can easily be peeled off. Wayyyyy lesser pain and no side effects.
5	I've been coming here for almost 2 years now. They are all really awesome and it is so worth it to buy a package and save money. Motivation to be hair free!
5	By far the best waxing experience I've ever had in my 7-8 years of getting various wax treatments. They use hard wax, and they use it much better than any other salon I've been to. In the past I've found that hard wax hurts more than the strip wax which already hurts (a lot) but the ladies at European Wax Center are super gentle & well taught. The place is incredibly clean (I watched the lady wipe down the table & put new coverings on). The people are nice & efficient. Most importantly, this is the least painful waxing experience I've ever had which is pretty fantastic. I didn't experience any hard sells or pitches, and frankly I'd be fine with it because I do want their services.
4	Great place to go to for those of you with sensitive skin. I had stayed away from waxing for years because it always left my surrounding areas embarrassingly red and bumpy. I had done my research on this place and they use different type of wax, that makes ALL the difference! The only bad thing I could say about this company as a whole is that not all esthiticians are created equal, I went to another location(Arrowhead) before moving to N. Scottsdale and left with unpleasantly thin eyebrows! ):  Ask to see Brandy here, she did mine recently and did a great job! Also, she recommended a regrowth product that they have because I mentioned my encounter with the brow butcher and a week later, I am seeing great results! Super Exciting!!!
1	First time at this location and just needed brows done.  Wow, what the heck do the teach these people???  I literally left with one brown way shorter, much thinner, and not even CLOSE to looking like the other one.  My 11 year old niece could have done a better job.  And the girl who did it kept telling me she was "addicted" to waxing.  Maybe she needs to get addicted to learning about how to properly wax.  Have gone to the location in Gilbert and always had good luck.  2 thumbs down on this experience!!!!
4	Went here for the first time for a Brazilian.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  Katie is amazing, you almost forget what you're having done!  Almost :)The wax doesn't hurt as badly as strip wax, comes off cleaner, and is much more sanitary!  I'll be returning.
5	Imagine a painless Brazillian well then you'll love this place! Sara is amazing (not me the girl working there :)) The staff is friendly and treatments are priced at a reasonable price. They also have products that they sell which I am a big fan of! Will definitely be a regular and I cant wait for my next visit.
5	I've been to two different European Wax Centers and always have a great experience. I much prefer this style of waxing over the strips. It's cleaner, less painful and faster. All good things when you're having hair ripped out of your unmentionable areas! Nadia was wonderful and I of course booked my next appointment with her on my way out the door. I do not find the girls at the desk to be pushy at all. I simply told them I could not afford to prepay for multiple sessions and that was the end of it. Highly recommended.
4	Quick, painless, and Katie is awesome!!
4	Love this place. Everyone is friendly and they do a great job.Minus one star for the fact that they are too pushy about buying their products or wax passes.
5	I started coming here once I switched hair salons and needed someone to wax my eyebrows.  After a while, I decided to start getting my legs waxed as well.  Never having to shave my legs is such a relief!  Rachel is a pro and it hardly hurts when she pulls the hairs out.  I try and recommend European Wax Center to any woman I know, especially because first time visitors get a free wax, no strings attached!  You can't beat that!
4	First off, I'd like to say that I was very impressed that Kari, the GM, reached out to me after reading my first review.  This tells me that she takes Yelpers seriously and that she appreciates what clients think.  Second, she made me an offer to come back, so I took her up on it and was not disappointed!  Had a Brazilian and eye brows done, and Sara was extremely knowledgeable (and gentle where it counted).  Quite frankly, having your body hair ripped out by the roots is not a pleasant experience, but Sara was great.  I was impressed and made a follow up appointment.  So, that being said, if you give this place a shot (which I now think you should), ask for Sara.  You won't have a "40 year old virgin" flashback!!!!!!
5	Erika is amazing for all your waxing needs!!  Ask to see her:)
5	First visit and it was very pleasant. Also first bikini wax. Wasn't as embarrassing or painful as I thought it would be! Salon was clean and employees were professional and nice. My wax lady, Rachel, was awesome too. I will be back!
5	I have been going here for about 2 years and I recommend it to everyone. This specific location is nice and clean and the ladies at the front desk are always super friendly. I go and see Rachel who is not only friendly and professional, but she does a great job every time!!
5	Friendly staff and amazing waxers. The bees wax is the bees knees!
2	******I'm editing my review!***********From 5 stars to 2*************6/6/13:Still love Whitney - she's great! But the front desk girls have not been great - at all! Twice now, I have booked an appointment, showed up and told my appointment is not in the system. What!? So then I have to re-schedule and come back another day. So frustrating! Another time, I show up to my appointment and another waxer besides Whitney shows up. I really like how Whitney does my brows, I'm not going to book with anyone else, so everytime I call to schedule I tell them i'm calling to schedule with Whitney. I feel bad for the waxer that they booked me with because it's an appointment time she could have had one of her clients book and earn money for that appt time. Last week I get a reminder call that I have an appointment the next day - an appointment I never made!?!  When you wait in the lobby they are very unprofessional - discussing personal things that I shouldn't have to listen to while waiting for my waxer. The front desk staff really needs to get it together! I was very impressed with them when I first came in January '13 - what happened?!?***************************************************************************************1/8/13:First time visitor for an eyebrow wax at European Wax Center. I was previously having my eyebrows threaded but noticed they kept getting thinner and thinner and losing their natural shape. So I've decided to go back to waxing. My friend recommended Whitney. Whitney did an excellent job and kept my eyebrows thicker like I prefer and followed my natural arch as requested. She was quick and no stray hairs were left behind. I had stopped getting waxed a couple years ago because the wax would feel too warm and I'd be so red afterwards. I started threading but threading is much more painful with the constant ripping of the strings & would sometimes cause cuts on my skin. Also, threading takes much longer!  The wax at European Wax Center is very gentle, no pain & no crazy redness afterwards. I highly recommend Whitney & I'll be going back to her for my eyebrow waxing & do not wish to have them threaded ever again.Also, the ladies at the front desk are extremely polite on the phone, during check-in and check out. Very professional!
5	European Wax Centers have the reputation of being the best because they are. I asked a friend who is a waxer about Brazilians and she said she doesn't even do them, just leaves them to Euro. This location runs like a well oiled machine and the entire staff is so professional and each room is clean, but welcoming.When I first started, I bounced around and cared more about the time of my appointment than my waxer and they were all good, but I'm so glad I eventually got put with Erika and now adjust my schedule to get an appointment with her because her technique is fast and effective and chatting with her takes my mind off what's going on...ouch! They initially got me in with a first wax free offer, good for all local residents, and they frequently have specials that allow you to pre-pay for 9 and get 3 free, so when I'm running low and they offer that again, I stock back up.
5	Best wax experience from Taylor!
1	Do not go to this place!  The owner Doug is rude and spends his time talking negatively about customers and other businesses. Such a turn off when you pay money for services and overhear such mean and negative comments!
5	It was my very first waxing experience and I must say I absolutely loved it. Kari, the GM, and the front desk ladies were super friendly. Camille was absolutely wonderful! She explained me the waxing process and what kind of wax they use etc. in a very friendly manner. She tried to maintain a conversation throughout and answered all my questions to the best of her knowledge. She also told me about the different lotions and body wash they offer but without trying to sell them which was nice. The waxing did not hurt as much as I thought it would hurt and I only noticed little redness of my skin afterwards. I had a great experience at EWC and already scheduled my next appointment. Five stars!
1	This was my 1st time and am disappointed . My legs were not waxed neatly and left small scars on my knee and eyebrow while using the tweezer .  The one who did was v nice and friendly but wat matters most is how the Job's done . I have posed two pics have a look at that
5	best location.  Get waxed by Amanda almost pain free this time! so worth the money, and no pain!
5	I had previously been to Suddenly Slimmer Spa -- the brazilian there took an hour and was extremely painful. I went to see Nicole today at European Wax Center - the brazilian took 12 minutes and was minimally painful. I plan on seeing nobody but Nicole for this ever again. Easy Peasy
1	Worst run business ever!  For this kind of money, that they charged on my card before I even got there, they shouldn't screw up appointments.  Last time I waited 20 minutes and finally had to leave to go back to work without my service.  Rescheduled for today and was exactly 5 minutes late and they wouldn't take me.  But they charged me!!!  I asked for a manager and was told, "I don't know when Carrie will be here or even what day. She comes and goes as she pleases."  Seriously?   Don't waste your time or your money.
5	Long story short: schedule an appointment with Erika. She is the best.It was my first time getting a Brazilian wax and it was completely pain free. Erika is so easy to talk to that she takes your mind off the pain if there were any. I wouldn't go anywhere else. Also, there was a half price discount since it was my first time there.
4	I have a package with them and have gotten different areas waxed. It has been hit or miss for me with waxers. They are great priced and now that I found Erica she is the only one I let wax me. Everyone that works here is very friendly and makes sure my needs are met.
5	I have been to quite a few wax places and this place tops all! Erika is the BEST. She really relaxes you by talking about things that don't matter at all and gets your mind off what is REALLY happening. I will definitely recommend to my friends!!
5	Love this place. I went on a waxing sabbatical for a while, because every time someone did my brows they over-did it (and I just looked surprised all the time). Everyone at this salon does a great job, but Bree is my go-to girl. She's very professional, sweet and skilled.
5	So this review is for Erika, I've been going to her for about 3 years now and she's honestly the best. I usually get just a brow but I've expanded to half arm and Brazilian. She's extremely quick and efficient. I love talking to her she makes you feel really comfortable and knows what she's doing. I moved to CA but still come back just to get waxed by her. I started taking my little sister to her (who happened to be extremely nervous) and Erika is great with her. Do yourself a favor and make an appointment with Erika and see for yourself. :)
4	Been going here for over 3 years now. Rachel does an awesome job every time I go in and I love the shape that she has done with my brows. I get so many complements on how great they look. I'm still impressed by how painless the experience is with their wax. I will continue to go there because of the great service she gives me each and every time I come in.If the review was strictly for Rachel I  would have given them 5 stars but I hate how each time I come in the front desk girls try to push that packages on me. My guess is that they have to because I have told them in the past that I am not interested in signing up for one. I understand that they might be a great savings but some people don't have that money to spend up front on them. They have also forgotten to page Rachel and I ended up waiting almost a half an hour one time before I had to ask them what was going on. You would think that with how they run on time they would wonder why I had been sitting in the waiting area for so long.
5	I really love this place! I've been going for about 2 years now and have yet to have a bad experience. I've hopped around a few times and everyone I've seen has been great, but Amber is my favorite. The place is always really clean and everyone there is professional and friendly. I love that they email AND call to remind you of an appointment (I almost always forget!) The passes are great if you get services done frequently, and it's really nice that they let you split the payments over three months.The wax is great, so much more comfortable than any other place I've been to. Definitely recommend this place!
5	I never had a bikini waxing done before and I went today for my first waxing with Carey.  Of course, I was a little nervous and I told Carey this was my first time.  Carey was awesome!  She was so sweet and totally took my mind off of it.  It went so well with Carey that I decided to go all the way with a Braziian.  She was so quick and painless. You must go to her!
5	All I have to say is that Lizzie is absolutely amazing.  She is such a perfectionist with her waxes that she never misses a single hair.  I will never go to anyone else.
5	I really don't understand why everyone's review on this place isn't 5 stars. I love coming here, I always see Rachel and she is amazing. She does a great job on shaping my brows and does a really painless brazilian, all in about 30 mins or less. She is a perfectionist and does an excellent job. I live in London and always look forward to coming to visit my parents here and having a proper wax. The products that they sell here are also very good, I love the exfoliant and it is made for sensitive skin and I even use it on my face! Everything is also very clean and sterile and its overall just a wonderful place! I haven't tried any of the other staff members, so I'm not sure about them... but Rachel is lovely!
5	This location ROCKS!  I just moved to the Phoenix area from San Diego and am already familiar with EWC.  The company as a whole is a bit more pushy on their products and packages than others, but we're talking about removing hair from your lady parts, so my review is based on the actual wax.  I absolutely love their waxing method. I've seen 2 different girls at this location (Abby and Semina) and they have both been fabulous. I went to another European Wax Center location also in Scottsdale and it was NOT the same, so I definitely recommend coming to this location even though it's a little out of the way--it's worth it. I've received exceptional waxes and customer service from this location; two thumbs up!!!!
4	I absolutely love this place. I moved away for several months that didn't have a EWC and missed it so much. The wax here doesn't hurt, at all. I have extremely sensitive skin, any other wax location I wax up with rashes wherever i was waxed, but not after coming here. Plus, the wax doesn't kill when it's being ripped off. The wax ladies are all incredibly nice and take their time. I love leaving with my freshly waxed eyebrows! I didn't give it a full 5 stars because whenever I'm in, even though they are very friendly and welcoming, the front desk girls are really pushy for getting packages. I know it's their job and they make commission, however no means no. When I have to say no to a package 3 times, I'm not going to change my mind. But that is my one and only complaint!
5	This location has always been good about getting me in on such short notice! Jessica is the girl that I see and she is wonderful. Nobody else does my eyebrows as well. I love the concept and the packages. Very reasonably priced services.
5	Lizzy is sensational! I began getting Brazilian and leg waxing over 3 years ago. I was very self-conscious & tried other technicians but am thrilled to find Lizzy. She is professional yet personable. Her expertise and perfectionism makes her exceptional. I drive over 45 minutes to get there even though there is a European Wax Center located 5 minutes from my home! Well worth it!
5	Alyssa is a miracle worker! I asked her to do my brows last minute yesterday because they had gotten massacred somewhere else. She not only fixed them but took the time to tell me what I needed to do to make them better. She is always very friendly and makes you feel comfortable with whatever service you're getting. The front desk staff is also very nice and responsive. They always give you a reminder call, which helps with my busy schedule. The prices are reasonable and location is great. Five stars!!
