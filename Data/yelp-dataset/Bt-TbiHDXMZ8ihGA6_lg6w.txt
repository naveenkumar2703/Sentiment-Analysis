2	It's ok.Played from the tips and I got completely hammered. The landing areas are somewhat small and the course is in average condition. But then... I think I only paid 20 bucks to play there. Worth it for the money but not somewhere you go if you're on a golf trip in Arizona.
1	I have to say that my cobb salad was pretty declicious and my husband's club sandwich was well-made. Unfortunately, I was only given 1 tablespoon of dressing and the sandwich was completely dry. Our drinks (iced tea) were empty for some time so my husband took the glasses to the bar. The bartender completely ignored him and never filled the glasses. I went up 5 minutes later and asked our server who was behind the bar to fill them. The bartender, without making eye contact, said, "She's getting there, just hold on." How rude!When she brought us our glasses filled with tea, there was no ice. We quickly drank it down because our food was so dry and never got a refill. Eventually, I went to the bar to find the waitress and pay the bill.This is not my first visit. I was willing to give it another try after the last time. No improvement. Never going again. It seems that you must be 55+ to get any attention there. I can't see how they stay in business if they treat customers in such a way.
1	It's not okay... Waited 30 minutes just for a glass of wine. The management had the poor servers completely overworked. Additionally the food was not very good... It was fish and fries night and nobody liked it in my group. This is a management problem.
1	No hotdogs, overpriced facilities. Don't waste your time coming out here. Extremely rude staff in the pro shop.
