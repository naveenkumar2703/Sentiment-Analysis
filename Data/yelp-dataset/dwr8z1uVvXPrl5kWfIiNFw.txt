3	I'll admit I first went into this place because of the name which tickled me, and the food was pretty good as well. Exactly what you'd want from a Chinese, there are no great surprises but it's all round tasty food. I had the beef chow mein in black bean sauce which was actually really good, but my friends' dishes were a little bland. It seems to be a bit hit and miss; sometimes the dishes are great, other times they are a bit boring.It is quick though and the staff are really friendly. It's pretty cheap as well, which is always good, and for those living in Marchmont, it's not a bad local Chinese takeaway to have.
2	Yucky yucky. Sauce thicker than treacle, sweeter than sin, and shitter than, well, shit. Horrible.And I had such high hopes too. I'd heard only good things about this place. I had the usual crispy chilli beef and it was just awful. Soggy, tasteless, no heat, gooey awful awful awful. I'm getting a bit upset talking about it. Parting with the cash angered me.I know I don't like Chinese takeaways at the best of times and I always get coaxed into having them, but normally they're edible. I threw most of this away. And I'm not one for throwing away food. It gets 2* because my flatmate really enjoyed his. But then he's no taste.
