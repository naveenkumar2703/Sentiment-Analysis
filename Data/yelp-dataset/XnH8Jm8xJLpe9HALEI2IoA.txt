5	Denise the owner has been grooming for 25 years. She truly cares about your pets as if they were one of her own.
5	Don't need to show diamonds in the rough proof of vaccinations for them to groom your pet. You still need to Vaccinate your pet but proof is not required like some other pet stores.
5	The place was amazing! Very clean, super friendly, all around a great experience. Will definitely be taking our dog back in the future! Puppy looks great and worth the money by far!!
1	I brought my dog here thinking it would be a better experience then at Petsmart but when I walked in, I already had a bad vibe and wish I would have just stuck to my gut instinct. When I picked him up, his nails were bleeding and I wasn't informed that he was bleeding. I didn't notice until we got home and there was blood all over the carpet and couch. His haircut looked super uneven and it was only $10 cheaper than Petsmart. I definitely recommend just spending the extra money and taking your animal to a place where you know they will take care of your dog as if he is their own. I wouldn't mind the bleeding so much if they had informed me and maybe apologized but nope...nothing.
