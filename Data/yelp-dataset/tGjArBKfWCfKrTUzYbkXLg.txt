4	I came in to get a price adjustment on a product that went on sale 3 days after I purchased it. I didn't need to bring the product it, just my receipt and the card I used. It was quick & easy! I didn't originally buy the product (a 10-piece comforter set) from this location, but they were still able to give me the price adjustment. I was told price adjustments were valid 2 weeks from the purchase date, but make sure to verify!The ladies in this store are very helpful. I think the store is well organized for all the things it has, including window coverings, beds-in-a-bag, sheet sets, bathroom items, etc. Some of the products are really high up, so make sure you get help. Also, they have a clearance section near the front.Overall, I think this store is satisfactory. I recommend it.
3	Anna's Linens has an abundance of items for your kitchen, bath, bedroom, and more. Sheets, blankets, pillows, towels, the list goes on and on. The reason I don' t frequent AL more often is that the quality of the merchandise seems to not be as high as other stores that sell similar products. The store seemed in a bit of disarray the day I went. The employees seemed to just be working for their paychecks and not really enjoying their jobs. The prices at AL can't be beat. I just hope that the items I bought today will last me a long time.
2	The staff proposed persistence to ask them if we need help finding anything... I approached one and he just pointed to where the item was. I still didn't find them and he didn't even offer to do a stock check or show me similar items! It was just a king black sheet set?! How hard is that!!Secondly: there was a staff member female that was on the phone talking definitely not professional and super ghetto. And was on the phone with her boyfriend like HEY BABY HELLLL YEAH TURN UP! Professionalism at its lowest!
