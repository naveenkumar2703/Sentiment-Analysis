5	This is my favorite radio station. For music, it's a good mix of hip hop, freestyle, and dance music- in other words, music to dance to at a party. It allows me to enjoy my morning commute. Just like the name of the station, it's music that makes me feel good. And sometimes relive a memory when I hear a song from back in the day. Hope the format stays the same.
4	I like this radio station because they play a bunch of Old School songs from the 80's & 90's and mix it in with some newer stuff.  Very mainstream though.  It's always a fun station to listen to.
