3	Some of the best drive through iced tea around :)
4	Double drive thru. Good service.
4	For a McyD's I'm a fan but just for the ambiance. This is a bloody nice McDonald's - Wood-like accents, fireplace, lovely tables. We stopped on our way out to the lake for a quick breakfast. The food was...well...McDonald's but it was a lovely place to buy this food. I had the yogurt & fruit and shocked how small it was! But when I ate it I couldn't finish it so it was fine. The boys had egg mcmuffin, sausage biscuit, & the mcgriddle thingy (he didn' t care for it). But if I have to eat at McDonald's this is the one I would frequent.
5	This McDonalds never disappoints.
2	The food is usually fine. However, we use the drive through at least once a week and I would say that 1/3 to 1/2 the time something is wrong or missing from the order. Make sure to check your bags before driving away.
1	This McDonald has useless workers who don't listen when taking an order.  It's not that had to push a button that says no onions on a cheeseburger. If I hadn't looked my son would had eaten onions that he is not able to eat. Great job McDonalds for trying to kill my son. Get real employees that listen when taking an order, then just there for a pathetic check.
1	The people that run the drive thru are a joke. Apparently it is really difficult to understand that someone wants a large coffee and not a small. They also do not make any attempt to make it right for any of the times I've been there and they have messed up my order.  I filled out a survey online -let's see if anybody from the store actually follows up as I have requested them to!
