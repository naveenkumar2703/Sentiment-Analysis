5	You can count on being pleased with the results with Lucky Shot Photography. Meg is a pleasure to work with and has a great eye for composition.  She is also extremely patient and easy going. This makes for a happy experience during the photo shoot.  Once you get your photos you won't be disappointed!!
5	If you are looking for an amazing photographer at a very reasonable price then look no further...I can highly recommend Lucky Shot Photography.Meg is such a doll, and is a pleasure to work with.  I had a great time during our mini photo session for my company (it was a last minute deal and of course everything was needed with an express turnaround time, and Meg delivered).  I can't wait to book another session to see what she comes up with next.
5	I hired Meg to do our newborn baby shots. I was extremely impressed not only with the set up and her creativity with the shots but also the final results! I will be using her again as our little guy progresses!!!
5	I am so glad we chose Lucky Shot Photography for my maternity & our baby's newborn photos; Meg is simply amazing.  Her ideas for the photo shoots were beautifully creative, elegant and flexible.  She also handled our baby wonderfully - even taught us a few tricks to calm our baby!  It meant a lot for me to capture our baby's early moments and the pictures Meg created are gorgeous.  They couldn't have turned out any more perfect! Thank you Meg!
5	We had Meg do our 6 month photos as well and considering how well she did with the previous shoots, it was no surprise she blew it out of the water!  I had no gameplan, just a few outfits - but Meg was prepared. She captured incredible shots I wouldn't have thought of myself in a hundred years and now they are hanging on my walls!
5	I had a brilliant mini photo session with Meg today at the Mesa Arts Center. She has a keen eye for detail and a great sense of humor. She captured me (and my award winning shawl) in great shots.
