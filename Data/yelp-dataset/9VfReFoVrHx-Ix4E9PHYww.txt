4	Conveniently located right next door to an equally amazing butchers, Walton's sells good quality fish and seafood. What's more, they tick the one box that often puts me off independent fishmongers - freshness. Very often when you're looking in the window at all the weird and wonderful types of fish/eel/crustacean of some description that I couldn't even begin to name, they'll still be wriggling. Can't get much fresher than that in my book.Their salmon's not great though, mainly because it's farmed not wild, so it's really oily. Otherwise, this place is great. If you're eating on a budget, if you go in at the end of the day you get some really great deals, too.There's another fishmonger's just up the street, but the staff in this one are really chatty and friendly, so I always seem to end up coming back here.

The prices aren't outstanding, but remain fairly reasonable and very much on a par with those you get at similar places in the area.  However, what really counts in this shops favour is the fact that it has a butchers next door so a trip here will cover both your meat and fish needs in one single location.  This fact alone makes it worth a visit especially as the next door butchers is a good one.
