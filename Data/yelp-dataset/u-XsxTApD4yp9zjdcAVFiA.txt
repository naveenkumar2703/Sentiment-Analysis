4	We love stopping at this Subway before going to Seastrand park. It is perfect for a picnic in the park!The store is clean and the staff is friendly. I do have trouble finding parking sometimes.Try the cookies!!!
5	This is one of the better stores, the ingredients are always kept fresh, the staff is professional and efficient.  Great sandwiches, highly recommend the flat breads.
5	This location is now open 24 hours. I went in for a sandwich at around midnight and got EXCELLENT service. I know, I know, it's easy when you're the only customer in the store, but the worker (a younger asian guy) was truly cheerful and pleasant to talk to. The food was also fresh and the veggies didn't look like they'd been sitting around even though it was the middle of the night.
