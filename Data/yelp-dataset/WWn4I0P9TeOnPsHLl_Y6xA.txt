5	I am very impressed with this establishment. My last two haircuts were garbage so I thought I would give this place a try. I walked in, sat right down and was very happy with my haircut. I highly recommend sports clips to anyone in need of a good haircut. I got the "MVP treatment" and probably will every time I return. Very happy.
5	I am always a little nervous when I have to look for a new place to get a haircut.  It's not the fault of the stylist for being timid, after all, they don't know what you like.  It doesn't always end well.  Even though it had been a while since I visited a SportClips, I had a good experience previously and this location was very close.Tiera greeted me right away and she promptly went to work (one benefit of this being a new location).  I was very impressed because she gave off a "I know what I am doing" vibe.  The bottom line is, I got a great haircut and Tiera is awesome.  I will definitely be back!Here's hoping that more people discover the great service at this location!  Thanks Tiera!
5	I picked this place out for my bf to try because it was close by and had good reviews. He loved it!!! I am so happy we found somewhere he likes and that does a great haircut. We will definitely be regulars from now on.
