4	this starbucks isn't as busy because its more the business oriented shop for the businesses around and the neighborhood residencies. but the workers do know their regulars and newbies. very welcoming. clean store. its too bad they're open till 6pm. they definately have one of the cleaness bathrooms i've ever encountered.
5	I work in the business park right behind the Starbucks, so I pop in periodically for my morning caffeine or mid-day Frap. I'm sure you've all been to a SBX before, so I won't go into detail about the variety of drinks they serve. But I will tell you I just had the coconut creme Frap yesterday afternoon, and it was awesome. I believe it's only a seasonal thing, so I don't know how long it'll be around, but you should check it out next time you're up there. In regards to this particular SBX, I like it. The baristas are friendly, and they're usually pretty cool when the office places large orders of a bunch of Fraps. They've never messed up my orders, which is something that happened occasionally at the UNLV Starbucks I used to frequent so much. Plus, they're pretty quick. In the mornings, I usually just get a cup of coffee and sometimes a scone, and I can be in and out of that place in less than 2 minutes. I love that. My only complaint with SBX as a whole is that I'm not sure that paying $3 for their coffee is worth it all the time. It's consistently a good cup of coffee, sure, but it's not consistently a GREAT cup of coffee. I can get pretty good coffee for 79 cents at the Terrible's and it's consistently average. I don't know if that argument makes sense, really, I'm just not wowed by their coffee all the time.
