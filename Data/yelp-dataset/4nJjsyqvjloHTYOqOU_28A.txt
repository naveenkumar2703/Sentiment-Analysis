5	After getting separated from my wife of 11 years, I found myself in a desperate search to answer many questions about myself, the broken relationship and my depressive state. I was incredibly lucky to work with Jennifer over the past year to help heal the pain and move forward with understanding the reality of the break up. With hard work, weekly sessions, many tears and an abundance of recommended reading, Jennifer helped me navigate through the plethora of emotions I was feeling. Today, I am happy to say that I am so much better than I would have ever imagined. The therapy has helped me gain control of my life and my emotions.Anyone that is experiencing any challenging times in a relationship would benefit tremendously by hiring Jennifer as their therapist. Not only will she help you works toward positive relationship tools, she will help you understand your self more than you can ever imagine. I highly recommend Jen to you and know you will benefit just as I have.

I knew in the first 30 minutes that I had met someone who could help me through profound professional and personal transitions and help me grow emotionally.I am far from fixed, but have come a long way in a short period of time with Jen.  Issues that brought me nothing but anxiety, anger and overall negativity are now viewed with cautious optimism.  I am kinder to those around me and kinder to myself.Jen's directness is surgical but leaves no scars:)  I am grateful that I found Jen on yelp.
