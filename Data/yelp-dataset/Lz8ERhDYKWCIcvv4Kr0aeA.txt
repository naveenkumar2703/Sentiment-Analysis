4	So far so good. I've been told Dr Martin is the best at what he does. Staff has been very friendly & always smiling!
4	Ortho-AZ.. I have been with Dr. Martin for a year and a half now working on my right shoulder. He has operated on it twice and can say he is absolutely wonderful!  Dr. Martin = 5 starsSo you may ask why the 4 stars?My biggest issue is the the wait time.. Its a touch and go issue some times I get in and out really fast and other times it take a hour till I can even get in the back. (Try to get in as early as possible). One other issue I have is one of the front office staff was extremely rude a few times when I was asking a few question about apt and surgery times. She acted as if I was stupid and was bothering her. Try to always work with Ashley she is the best up there! The x-ray tech was fantastic too. Always goes slow and watches out for your injured wing in my case.. Dr. Martin takes his time on you while you are there to answer Q's and assist you in anyway.   My surgery was scheduled for three hours but cause there had been more to work on he didn't just say oh guess that will have to wait he took the time and energy and kept working to total 7 hours. Really did a great job!
1	Horrible! Dr. Fox doesn't know what he's doing and just jumps to conclusion without other tests. Also, the receptionists got very snotty with me! Never going back again!
