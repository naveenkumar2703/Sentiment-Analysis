5	The crew at this store couldn't be more friendly and helpful.  They were very honest and straight forward with what needed to be done with my car and what really was optional.  The pricing was fair and they explained all charges before doing the work.
1	Prices too high and service very slow. Save yourself lots of money and frustration and avoid this location. I've made the mistake of getting service here three times and always leave in a bad mood. Watch out for the aggressive up sell!
1	Went here today for a flat tire patch.  I left pertinent info and went across the street to kill time.  When I returned, a mechanic mentioned that I was due for an oil change, and did I want them to change my oil?  I said no (my dealership recommends every six months versus every three months) and the mechanic looked stricken, and went back into the garage.  When I paid the bill, I was surprised to discover a charge for an oil filter that was not "okayed" by me.  I returned home and noticed a sweet smell by my radiator.  Radiator fluid.  I can't figure out that none of those guys could figure out that there was a radiator leak while they were replacing the oil filter that I did not approve!Taking my car back to the dealership tomorrow.  Never again, Goodyear!Update:The radiator fluid smell was due to the fact that the staff at Good Year opened up the radiator to see how the level of fluid was.  In doing so, some of the fluid splashed up on my grill, causing the sweet smell.  How did I discover this?  When I took my car to the dealership after I smelled the radiator fluid.  Expensive lesson learned.
