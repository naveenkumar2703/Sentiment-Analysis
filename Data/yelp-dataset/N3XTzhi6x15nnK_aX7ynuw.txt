5	I drove by to the Rancho Discount Mall today just to check out Las Vegas Vapes' booth. At first glance i was a little iffy and a little put off from their selection and the size of their shop. But nonetheless, it's cheaper to rent the space.The person working today was a man named Devin. The reason of my visit was to check out their flavors. Their selection isn't huge, and their aren't any testers there other than open "sample" bottles that you can smell. I was able to drip them though, but i ended up getting a nicotine rush since those bottles were 18mg aha. The flavors are very tasty, i ended up buying myself the flavor of the day (tornado-a mix of grape and lime) for 7 dollars! it was a nice size bottle too, 20ml for 7 bucks. Can't go wrong there. Other flavors start at $10, which still isn't bad for 20ml.Devin is a friendly guy and it was nice to have a small chat about things and it made my problematic morning a lot easier. Too bad there weren't any chairs or stools to sit down on, i see this place as a "quik-e-vape" or stop buy and leave. As i've mentioned in other Vape shop reviews, i like to sit down, relax and vape.Down to a short, great prices, friendly service, great products. Check this place out!
5	Las Vegas Vapes is in my top five vape stores in vegas. Earl and Devin are what customer service is all about. They are knowledgable and don't talk down to you with any question you ask. Sometimes i like to go to a store get what i want and be on my merry way in less than two minutes-Vegas Vapes is just that way.
1	I was totally disappointed . I came in and was lookin to purchase quiet a few of the juices. They hard very few to choose from. It was a  girl and and some white guy. He didnt really help , they didn't even have any samples ! I felt very rushed and put aside as he was talking to his girlfriend about what she should buy to eat ! I will not be returning . And I took my business elsewhere .
