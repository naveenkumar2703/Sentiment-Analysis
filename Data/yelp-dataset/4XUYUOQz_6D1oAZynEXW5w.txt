5	These guys are honest and very nice. Had them do my total engine in my Saleen and they did it right. Honest and I refer everyone to them to everyone.
5	I drove from Scottsdale AZ to Las Vegas Nevada and when i arrived in Las Vegas i first blew a flat tire.  Luckily it was right next to the shop! They patched my tire in 5 minutes even though all their mechanics were already working on their projects.  They were very nice.  They even took the time to bring my car on the lift and check it out for free.  Couldnt ask for a better mechanic shop!
5	I bought a car from these guys, fair deal no bullshit. he gave me a fair price and no high pressure sales pitch, id recommend them
