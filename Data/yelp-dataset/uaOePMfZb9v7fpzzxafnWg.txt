5	Surprisingly good. Crawled into this place after coming off a binge, (won't say what, but I was zombie status) craving some soup, I was tempted by the super nachos, asada nachos they call it, if your not familiar with super nachos, it's a big plate of messiness, chips beans guacamole sour creme cheese pico meat salsa. A bunch of shit all combined to make your nachos super. I ordered that and a shrimp cocktail, shrimp cocktail was ok, they don't have tapatio there, I need tap with my cocktail, so it wasn't as good to me, but this is my substitute for my filibertos super nachos. Also stopped in for a burrito another day, and was happy I did. They are open late and conveniently close to home, stop by if your as unsatisfied with fili b's as I was.
2	Food flavor ok, but serving sizes are very poor.  Price is average.  However, I have eaten at this Salsitas place 3 times and every time the serving size is minimum.  I do not recommend this place at all.I can upload pics so you can understand why I do notrecommend this place.
1	I have eaten at many Salsitas which are usually good, but this one sucks. Six bucks for a.pollo asada borito that was pretty much beans and rice. What chicken there was had a funky smell.
4	I love coming in and getting the tripa burrito with everything. The staff are very friendly and fast.
