3	I remember going here in High School... was a great first place to learn about being gay... friendly people... and in the heart of the Fruit Loop (well, the bookstore, and three bars/ clubs that make up the hub of gay life in Las Vegas... which I still probably make one pilgrimage to once a year when Im home for the holidays... good stuff).
3	Kicking off Mediocre Monday is Get Booked! Woooooooo!We were looking for the "Fruit Loop" which we thought was a gay bar and we ended up here. It was here we found out that the Fruit Loop is the area that this place and a couple of other gay establishments is in. Get Booked is a small store with LGBT stuff - from books to decor to novelty items to porn.  Apparently the name Get Booked comes from an incident between the owner and the cops! We learned this from a really cool employee. We got to meet the store's weird, slightly rude owner who told us that The Buffalo next door was a cool bar. He said, "tell them blah blah blah sent you" and they will hook you up. So I went to The Buffalo and told the bartender that blah blah blah sent me and I got a free cocktail!
3	I really like this place and find the prices to be decent. I had to get some items for a party here and was welcomed by the friendly staff.The reason I gave the place only 3 stars was due to the fact I tried to visit the store  multiple times and the place was closed. The hours listed on the door are never followed.
