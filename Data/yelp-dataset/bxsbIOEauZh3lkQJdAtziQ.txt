5	The Earnhardt Body Shop has the BEST customer service I have ever experienced anywhere.  They work hard to have your vehicle done quickly.  All of the people who work there know what they are doing and are friendly and easy to work with.  They really take care of you and feel completely comfortable with what needs to be done with my car, and I know they are not going to charge me for things that do not need to be done.  If anything, they work hard to save me money!  I would take my car there for anything that needed to be done!
5	Years ago, I was out of town when I got a panicked call from my wife stating that someone hit our 2008 Ford Edge. After meeting with the party who hit us, we got three estimates to repair the vehicle.  The best one out of the bunch was Earnhardt Body Shop.  Being a person who has some experience in this arena, I looked closely at the quality of their work on other vehicles and I was impressed.  I left my Edge with them for around 2 weeks.  During that time, they allowed me to take a look at the car while they worked on it and I was even more impressed with how they paid attention to the details.  When I picked it up, I saw no trace of the accident.  In fact, the Edge looked better than showroom. No globs of paint, overspray, or even uneven surfaces from where they worked on the car.  While customer service was stellar, I paid more attention to the quality of work and that spoke volumes to the point I am going back to them with my 2011 Edge for some spot repainting.
