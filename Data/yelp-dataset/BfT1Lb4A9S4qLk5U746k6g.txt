5	Seen this place many times driving home. Since it's a HOT 106 degrees today, decided to stay cool with some shaved ice. The Tigers Blood (Strawberry, Watermelon & Coconut w/ cream) was Ice-licious! Very refreshing, great blend of flavors and reasonable prices. Notes: It is located on the corner parking lot of Choice Sincalir gas station, in a food truck stand. Don't forget your stamp card!Add cream! It's yummy & free!
4	We dropped by on a Saturday afternoon. The service is friendly and the selection is very good. We had a medium orange/mango and a medium pokemon/hawaiian punch. Both were very tasty and the ice is heaped on generously. Ice was a slight bit chunky (could stand to be smoother), but it was still satisfyingly flavorful.There is also good parking. Thinking about trying it out again, but next time WITH ice cream!
4	As Shaved Ice stands multiply around town, one landed at the Sinclair station on Windmill and Rainbow, called Sno Monkey.  After experiencing Hawaiian shaved ice near Honolulo, this wasn't too bad.  Good flavor selection, but the way they pack the ice on top isn't as tight as it was in Hawaii.  You can even top it with Azuki beans if you want.  Prices aren't bad for the size and the folks are pretty friendly.  Not the fastest though.Worth checking out!!!
5	I went here after school because I wanted something cold and it's really good for the price. They pack the ice then syrup then ice the syrup and that's why it gets a bit slow sometimes but it's good. I really liked it! It might be a regular stop for me ^^
