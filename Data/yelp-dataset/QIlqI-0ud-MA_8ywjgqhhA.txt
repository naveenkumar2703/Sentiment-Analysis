5	I have closed on several properties with various challenges over the past 8 years. There has always been an attitude of helpful patience from the escrow officers and staff. I recently had a issue with the Clark County tax assessor on a property that was being sold on short sale. the county headed the property into their name because of back taxes. the taxes were paid and the county promise to do the property back into the correct name within 30 days. I called the county several times trying to verify when they would complete the deed correction and after 6 months they still hadn't completed it. when I explain to the title company the problem I was having they made a couple of phone calls and have it resolved within 2 weeks. they didn't even charge me for the just did it as a favor. that is what I call excellent customer service.
5	This was my second experience with Nevada Title Company.The service is always superb!  This Company stands out from all other Escrow/Title Companies I know and worked with, and it was a real pleasure doing business with the team of high professionals: Michelle Disbrow and Charla Gutierrez.  Their branch is located at 10000 W. Charleston Blvd, #180, Las Vegas, NV 89135; Phone: 702-254-8286.If I could, I would give them a much higher score than Five Stars. They truly deserve to be praised! The escrow went and closed without a hitch, smooth like it could be only in a fantasy world:  the communication was immediate and to the point; they accommodated all our wishes and concerns without any hesitation, which made it a pleasant experience.  Really, as good as it gets!
