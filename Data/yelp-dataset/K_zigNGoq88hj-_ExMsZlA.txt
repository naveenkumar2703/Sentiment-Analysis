4	Dilen Haircuts is a cheap and good hair salon. Whenever i need a good hair cut, from now on I will go to Dilen Haircuts. Whenever I go there, I feel relaxed and at ease. I truly recommend anyone who needs a good and cheap hair cut, color, and perm, I will always tell them to go to Dilen Haircuts.
5	Dilen has moved from Seattle and is setting up shop here.  She knows a lot about hair.  I had to listen carefully to understand sometimes, but it is worth being patient.  My hair is very long and I am older, so she conditioned it and gave me a lot of wisdom about taking good care of my hair.  The cut she gave me was just like the photo I gave her.  She colored my hair and highlighted it.  I can't believe how much care she gave to my hair.  She really cared about how I looked and made me look the best I have ever looked.She certainly is a top salonist.  I would recommend her to anyone.
1	Got a haircut because of the good reviews of the people, must have been her friends. Didn't get the cut i wanted (Like the picture i showed her). Don't be fooled. Maybe thats why there's nobody else there too. For the price of the cut and style, i could have gone somewhere else for cheaper price. Trust me, don't do it. Only good thing about this, she was a nice lady. But sucks for me though.
