5	I needed 100 gift boxes customized for an upcoming event. Timi and her team at An Octopus's Garden put everything together for me, including making customized boxes with our company sticker. My colleagues and I changed our mind on nearly every aspect of the project, but AoG was happy to accommodate our requests. I was amazed by the customer service and the excellent communication. They even delivered all 100 boxes to different hotels in the area.If I ever need flowers, gift boxes or anything fun and beautiful while in Las Vegas, I will call Timi first.
5	Timi is outstanding and the entire business at An Octopus's Garden is exemplary in every way. They have a great eye and were very good about helping me decide on an arrangement without trying to run up the price. Very highly recommended.
4	I found their flowers and customer service to be exemplary.  I would definitely recommend this place to a friend.  I needed a last minute arrangement for a family event.  They came through big time with something affordable and stunning.
5	An Octopus Garden delivered the most beautiful fresh roses that I have ever seen for a huge Women's Conference in Vegas. We appreciate how much Timi supports the Las Vegas community by coming alongside organizations with service that has heart.
