2	I am a current member but not happy with the club. Average food, below average sports club.
4	The course is always in good shape and the staff very friendly.....the greens are always well maintained and excellent practice facilities.the only negative I have is the restaurant, which consistently has slow service, mediocre food and not a very good menu.Nevertheless is is a very nice course.
5	My husband and I got married here 5 years ago. We were so happy with everything. The grounds are beautiful, staff is professional, was everything we could have asked for. Yes it is a long drive but well worth it, there nothing like it in Phoenix
2	I am a member there only because there are no other country clubs close by.  Welcome to Gilbert/ Queen Creek/ San Tan Valley!!! :(
