4	One thing about Henderson, you'll find a lot of parks in the neighborhoods.  This is a good thing since this also means a nice quiet park.  Another thing about the community parks in Henderson, they're all well manicured and clean.  Paseo Verde is no different.  I've spent a lot of time at both Paseo Verde and Discovery Park a couple of months ago. I had a pre-Lent friend that I use to see all the time and it was either the District or parks to hang out at. This was one of those parks we'd hang out at.  Couple of things you'll find at this park-Plenty of parking.  If the lot gets full, parking can be done on the side of the street-Park is spacious, meaning a lot of green-Huge kids playground. -Sand Volleyball-Softball Field-Basketball Courts-A ton of covered picnic benchesOverall, I like this park and it's a great start to Paseo Verde's trail.  Parks like this are hard to find in California.  To be honest, parks in general are hard to find in California.  Out here, they're plentiful and all are nice to visit from time to time.
5	This is a fabulous park located near Paseo Verde and Valley Verde.   There is a huge baseball diamond area that I see frequently used.  They also have tennis courts, basketball courts and a large child play area.  There is a building directly next to the child area with restrooms which I'm sure the parents appreciate! With a few different small pavilions with tables, many families take advantage of this for a nice weekend picnic or party.  It is definitely a versatile park for many activities.  Plus it has many parking spaces available for one less worry.   :-)
4	Doesn't this park make you forget you're in the desert with its abundance of shady trees?!? Those mature trees are my favorite part, and something we're missing at the closest park to me - Reunion Trails. This is a great place for a picnic or just sprawling out on a blanket and enjoying a good book. Great mountain views, too! We're so spoiled with these amazing public parks!
