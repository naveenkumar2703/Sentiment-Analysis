1	worst pizza I have ever had.  Wasn't even cut properly.  Little Caesars is a 5 star restaurant compared to this place.  The 2 liter sodas are 2$, that's the best I can offer.It's cheap, but you can get better for about the same.  It's purposely designed to be cheap and catered to lower income families.  It's crap. Doesn't deserve  a star.
2	I think the little kwik-e-mart pizzas taste a bit better than these.  I had both peperoni and just cheese and both were somehow both drippy with grease and really really really hard to bite through.
1	When this place opened several years ago, it was decent for chain pizza. I picked up a pepperoni pizza earlier this year. They've clearly slipped. The pizza was greasy and orange, without a crisp crust. The ingredients were low-end; all I could taste was oil.Pizza Patron doesn't deliver and has no seating. It is takeout only and I think it may only take cash (although they do take both US and Mexican currency -- I kid you not). It is cheap, around $5-6 for a single topping. They have some pizzas always ready, in case you can't wait.
1	Horrible pizza place!!! Pizza is gross and the service is equally as bad. I called for a large pizza and was told it was $4.99. I asked for half pepperoni and half bacon. When I went to pick up my order they charged me an extra $2.50 for splitting the toppings. Would have been nice if they told me that when I called to place the order, especially when I specifically asked for the price. I asked to change my order since I wasn't warned about the extra price and I was told NO. Never going back!!!
4	$3.99 for a large pizza, great deal!  Not a lot of chesse or sauce but is still good.  Location is a little far from me but I just toast a few slices in the toaster oven to heat up when I get home.  The toaster oven makes the crust a little crispy and it is great!
