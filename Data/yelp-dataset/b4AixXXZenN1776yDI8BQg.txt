3	I cannot believe that I am the FTR D's.  From what I hear, D's has been an Old Town landmark for a long time now (at least 4 years).  It used to be a Circle K.  D's is 'that place' you can go for pretty much anything at most hours of the day - at least the hours that I've needed them.  -Smokes?  Go to D's!-Beer?  Go to D's!-Bottled water?  Go to D's!-Tampons?  Go to D's!-Diet Coke?  Go to D's!-Ice Cream?  Go to D's!-Munchies?  Go to D's!You get the point...D's is the convenience store closest to our new place;  I'm already thankful for D's and I'm sure I'll be a 'regular' in no time!
5	i've been here a few times, and they do actually close at some point during the day because at 7am one morning, they were closed.but it's like any other convenience store, but not as glitzy and there's no buffet of cheap coffee, donuts, or lunch-ables like the modern circle k's. what sets D's apart is the family that owns it. while there one afternoon, the owner, George, greeted everyone as if he'd known them for years. he even knew their names. Same with his wife...she had just baked some cookies and gave me a few. yes, i'll pretty much eat anything so i did, and they were good!a great little local establishment.
5	Family run mini market with friendly service hand lucky lotto.
4	Great neighborhood market (a converted circle k with non of the corporate stuffiness of your run of the mill convenience store)! Great selection of beer and reasonable wine selection - for a convenience store. A place where it's possible to know the owners and even occasionally get a break on prices of your a few cents short.Only thing I would change is the hours ( a little too inconvenient at times).
2	Very friendly place, family run.  Comparable to a Circle K.I dinged them for stars because of some freshness issues.  I bought a bottle of soda that was flat, and chips that ended up being right up against the expiration date.  I suspect business is a little slower at D's so inventory doesn't turn as fast.
