4	A friend of mine was needing some parts to repair one of his faucets and asked me to help.  Not sure why he asked me to help since I'm not a plumber nor do I know much about plumbing outside of the human body : -)We went to the Homeowners Plumbing Supply store on 51st and Thunderbird to get what we though we needed.  This place has been in business for a long time, owned and operated by an experienced plumber.  It's in an older strip center and doesn't look like much to do from the outside and inside, but they know what they are doing and have what you need.  They can help the most uneducated and ignorant plumber out there, and that was us! We showed the plumber dude a picture of what we thought we needed and he found us what we really needed after asking us a few questions.  He also recommended the things we needed to help in putting everything back together easier.  I'm a fan of this place and recommend you try them the next time you decide to tackle a plumbing project at home.
5	The owner asked me to email him a picture of my toilet that I needed a lid for.  Sure enough he emailed me back that he has the lid in stock. I got there and he GAVE me the lid.  Seriously, does this happen in todays society?  Very knowledgeable and very nice.  Said the lid was an extra off an old display.  I would highly recommend.
5	Had a problem installing a part in a commode, called the store and the owner talked me through it, and his instructions worked like a charm!  Highly recommended!
