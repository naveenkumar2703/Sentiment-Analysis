5	Mandy has photographed my baby since he was in my belly.  From the first time I met her she made me feel very comfortable.  I mean, the first time I met her I got stark naked for my maternity photos and I felt unbelievable comfortable even though this was the first time meeting her.  I found Mandy via her webpage and fell in love instantly with what she offered compared to other photographers. I did her maternity package (I can't remember the name exactly), I will cherish that book forever.  Everytime I look at those pictures in the book, I cry and get all mushy.  Mandy has always been more than flexible if my son was sick or we were running a little late to an appointment.  I look forward to having another baby so that I can work with Mandy again and capture those sweet, precious moments that only a wonderful photographer such as Mandy can capture.
5	Wow!! We LOVE Mandy. MY maternity pictures were awesome and they just keep getting better. My daughters newborn photos were amazing, everyone said they were the best pictures they had ever seen. Even when my sweetie was totally crabby at the photo shoot the pictures still came out great. I can't wait to see what the rest of the year brings!!! Great job Mandy keep it up.
5	Mandy is amazing! God gifted her with her craft..... Truly. My families pictures were amazing and I didn't get any surprise fees at the end of our session. She's really upfront about her prices and she's worth more then she charges. Once your with her she h,as these crazy monthly specials .... So awesome when you have 4 kids and a hotdog budget. Not going to another photographer......just wish she did weddings.
5	Great with the kids. Great pictures! Great transitions to other pictures to maximize picture time. Great attitude! I can't wait to go back!
