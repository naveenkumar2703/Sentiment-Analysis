4	I LOVE SONIC...ok first off I hate fast food. You will rarely find me at McDonalds, Taco Bell, or Carl's Jr. The only time you'd find me at Jack in the Crack is after a night of major partying. Funny how good their tacos taste after you upchuck all those jager and so co shots. I know......ewwwwww grosssss. Anyways my mind's wandering from the point of this all. SONIC I will eat. Helloooo dollar slushies. I could have a limeaid everyday. I usually get the grilled chicken sandwich thingy....i know it's not good for me but it doesn't taste like fast food so it's ok.
4	Juli P. was a delightful service attendant (: She always comes to our car with a smile and correct order ... Happy Hour at Sonic on a Hot day in the Valley is like a little prayer answered! check it out, you will not regret it!
