4	Went to a few jewelry stores and even though they didn't have a sale they had the best price by $100.
5	I love this location. I will be back again and again. I have come in here many times, sometimes there is an off Sales rep but 90% of the time I have worked with a very helpful, pleasant, non-pushy person. On top of that they have a great selection of beautiful rings (and jewelry).  Prices aren't as bad as I thought they would be. They also have customer appreciation discounts every so often.
4	They have a great selection, however, no anklets.  They stuck strictly to the jewellery with focus on diamonds.  The had some costume jewellery, but mostly the genuine articles.  Eileen was very helpful and Lindsay was also.  Both ladies were attempting to hone in on specifics to better match your needs.  Their knowledge and insight helps with intricate detail from the diamond clarity to the lifetime guarantees at any Helzberg Jewellery store for maintenance and repair.  They showcased many different collections such as Sirena, Everlon, Juno Lucina, and I Am Loved pieces
4	Thank you for making a beautiful ring! Sylvia was wonderful to work with and we love the finished product.
