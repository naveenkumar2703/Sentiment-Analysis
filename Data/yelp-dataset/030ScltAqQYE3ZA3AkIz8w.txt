4	Nice little park with restrooms and BBQs at the uppermost rim of the valley in the Northwest - just a couple of blocks from our place. If there's one thing Vegas does right it's parks. We've done a little hiking in this spot but came across a lot of shot-up / burned-up junk close by - which was kind of creepy but great for taking photos. Seems like people use this area as a suburban shooting range. Dramatic panoramic views of the entire Las Vegas Valley and the Strip below at night though!  I'd imagine this is a terrific place to view fireworks on the Strip on New Years or across the valley on July 4th.
5	I found this park by accident. It is one of the most breath taking,gorgeous, park I've been to yet! I can't wait to hike in here soon!Its not child friendly,there are no toys! Horses welcomed,dogs too.  Its very quiet, well minus the hum of the 215. I can be found here often!
4	Not much here other then a couple of picnic tables and a restroom. It does provide a nice place to park if you plan to hike around  Cheyenne Mntn. and want to start on the northern end of it.
5	When I first moved to this area, a lot of people used to hike up the trail about a quarter mile and shoot off their shot guns. Usually they would blow up a random cactus or something. I remember one summer the monsoon uncovered an old vintage 1940 era gangster car. It has been buried for decades. When I brought my friend back here to show him it, the local hicks had already shot it up and set it on fire. Yeah...that's the area we live in.
