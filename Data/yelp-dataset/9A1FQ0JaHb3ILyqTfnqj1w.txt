1	I know I check in here a lot, but the only reason I even step foot into this horrible place is because my employer uses this bank. I try to get here right when it opens to avoid lines, but low and behold, there's a line already forming outside. When we scramble inside to form another line, look, there's only 2 tellers!!!!!! FML!!! So after learning my lesson multiple times, I decided to try the drive through. Nope it's just as bad. I pull up to the little thing, put my money inside the tube and send it via vaccuum inside to the teller. 14 minutes later, she finally sends my receipt back via vaccuum. Wells Fargo, you can never get it together. I have no choice since I use this bank for work, but thank goodness I don't bank with you guys personally.
1	They made me answer 20 different  security questions because my debit card is lost. Even though I answered all the questions correctly they still made me call corporate to get an approval.  I've spent almost 45 minutes with two children simply trying to make a non complicated withdrawal from my account. I shouldn't have to fight this hard for my money.
2	I've been coming to this bank for years... never thought to write a review until now. The atm is great and I suppose the only time it wouldn't be is if it were empty. The tellers are rude, the managers are rude and it takes so long to do anything there! If it wasn't for my Wells Fargo accounts that I really like,  I would not bank here. I've never expected much being a bank and all but a smile and hello go a long way.
