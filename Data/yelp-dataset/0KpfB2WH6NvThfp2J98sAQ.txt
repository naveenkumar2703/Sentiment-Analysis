3	Lots of upselling. Quick oil change though.
3	Waiting room is not very comfortable. Too busy on a Friday be prepared for lots of upgrades. Good luck with just an oil change.  They are good and fast just keep at an oil change only.
4	pretty cool place. was in and out pretty quick. Customer service was okay. I got my oil changed and was out of there and thats good enough for me,lol
2	I couldn't even sit for more then 5 minute while my oil was being changed without them making me get up to try to sell me something. They even tried to sell me on some charity thing. I came to get an oil change! Also they didn't turn of my service light which was on because I needed an oil change.
1	I usually go to Gunnell's to get my oil changed but my wife and I just moved and this Jiffy Lube was the closest place. So I sent my wife there to have her oil changed and tires rotated, and when she came home she brought me a bill that was over $80. EIGHTY DOLLARS!!! She only had them do a routine oil change and a tire rotation! For one thing, any other service station will do a rotation for FREE if you are doing an oil change at the same time. Apparently it will cost you anywhere from $20-30 at Jiffy Lube. I went back to talk to the manager about the exorbitant prices and he explained to me that Jiffy Lube techs go over the prices with customers beforehand (something that was not done with my wife). After explaining that my wife DID NOT approve an $80 service fee, he told me he wouldn't give us refund and that I would have to call their corporate office if I wanted to pursue it further. Terrible customer service and lack of listening. If you want good prices for an oil change, go to Gunnell's. Maybe it won't be as quick but it will cost less than half as much. Needless to say, I will never go to Jiffy Lube again.
