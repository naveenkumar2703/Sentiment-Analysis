5	Kelly!! What can I say expect OMG! I have never experienced a massage quite like Kelly's! I am a personal trainer and fitness fanatic always wanting to push my self to the next level. With that comes some aches and pains that I just can't work out myself. I was so lucky to see a post on Facebook fromA friend recommending Kelly's services. I left Kelly's feeling refreshed and felt amazing for such a long time. I smiled eat to ear for days on end telling everyone I know about how awesome Kelly is!! I can't wait to see her again!!!!!!
5	Kelly is a lifesaver... True story!!! I work hard and workout hard so my body is always a wreck. I have invested a lot of money in massages over the years and was a member of Massage Envy for many years, what a waste! I would spend any amount of money to have Kelly work on me. I have never felt better until I met her. She took the time to ask questions about Injuries, issues etc so she could really help me. I had a footInjury last year and she was able to use trigger points in my legs to help relieve the pain. She is well worth it, and I can't go to anyone else now! Thank you for spoiling me Kelly. :)
5	I would definitely recommend Kelly for a massage for yourself or as a gift for your friend. Not only is she a fantastic massage therapist, she is also an athlete, so she is able to give you additional advice on how to make sure you're setting yourself up for success before and after your work outs. My favorite part about being massaged by Kelly is being stretched :). I would definitely call her if you want an amazing massage.
