3	This is a dank little place! And I don't mean that in stoner-speak.  It is literally a dank, dank, little place.  Granted, I'm from Californy and I'm not used to the drippy August humidity that was in effect when I visited, but wowzers was it steamy and dank in there.There was an impressive assortment of vinyl for sale! I found quite a few little gems.  If you've got itchy, black tips, then definitely stroll through there.  It is an interesting digging experience! If you're sensitive to inhaling mildew and perhaps exotic molds, then I'd bring some air filtration apparatus along with you.  And the record sleeves on the damper side of the shop had water damage.  Beware!  But check it out.
3	I'll agree with other reviewers that the atmosphere of this store may be pretty off-putting. It's basically just a dimly-lit rundown shack. A few years ago I vowed never to return due to an overwhelming bad odor inside. But I recently tried it one more time and had a better experience. Despite the atmosphere, there are some very interesting records to be found in the collection! Very reasonable prices, and many albums are in very good to great (even excellent) condition. The owner can be quirky, but seems generally friendly and helpful. If you're esp. into older jazz or the "male & female vocal" genre, I think you'll find the selection quite interesting. Not too bad for rock and blues either, though that selection seemed a bit more common. Worth the trip for the more adventurous vinyl hunter.
