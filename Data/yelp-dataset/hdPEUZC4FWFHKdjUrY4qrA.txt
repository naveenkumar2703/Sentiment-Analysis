3	I have only been once in this particular store and got a bit dizzy with all the bright signs posters located erratically around. This WH Smith  seems to be overflowing with stock which feels like it has been stuffed on shelves and piled on tables and will at any moment overflow and come tumbling down on to you. You can find some great deals on books and stationary, which makes me think all the overstock of other stores might end up here. It's a bit hard to orientate around despite the signs. I am hoping this jumbled mess was a one off thing and that they have sorted it it out since then cause it was becoming a bit claustrophobic in there. Usually I like jumbled bookshops where you have to hunt around, but this place somehow was not relaxing and I wasn't willing to stay too long in there in case it really did explode.
3	The books in this WHSmith can be roughly divided into three categories: Chick-lit for train journeys, airports and beach holidays.Bloody and grueseome thrillers for train journeys, airports and beach holidays.Travel guides to make you wish you were taking lots of long train journeys and beach holidays. I'm always drawn to the latter but the titles and book covers of the first two usually put me off. I mean, who wants to be seen reading a book called Broken, Blind Fury, I Heart Paris or Men I've Loved Before? Personally, I'd opt for a Mojo, Rolling Stone or Vogue from the magazine section instead.
3	Good but not great.Pretty wide magazine selection given its smallish size though.
