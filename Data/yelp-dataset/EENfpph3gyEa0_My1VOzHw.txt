Well, the gal at the counter was confused at my request for the coffee and cake combo, but we worked it out. I prep my coffee and have a seat in their dining area and...wow, the coffee had a richness that I was not ready for; so happy! The cake which is good on its own, was taken to new heights accompanied by that strangely delicious cup of joe.
