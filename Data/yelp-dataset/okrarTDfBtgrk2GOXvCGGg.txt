3	smack dab on the NE corner of Maryland and 7th Street, this is the grocery store under the Shell sign.yummy sandwiches. nothing you can't live without. but i think they are the best sandwiches you will get from a gas station. place also stocks a thousand different types of 50ml shooters. larger bottles too. but i'm not talkin bout that right now.so lets see, fill your car with gas, fill your belly with a sandwich and wash it down with 3 shots of Jim Beam. you rock. don't get caught with a DUI now.
1	So, the way I figure it, a 24/7 gas station/deli should be open, hmmmmmm, let me think, 24/7?  I'll give you Christmas; they could reasonably closed on Christmas.  Not New Years, people are hung over or just getting out of jail/back from Vegas, so, open New Years.   But yesterday?                                April 21, 2013, CLOSED!  9:54pm, CLOSED.  NOT OPENOh well.NOTE TO OWNER OF MARYLAND DELI AND LIQUOR, AKA: 7TH STREET SHELL STATION: BAD BUSINESS, PAL.  BAD BUSINESS.  I'LL NEVER COME BACK TO OVERSPEND ON EVERYTHING, (which if they are open, it's a convenience I'll pay for) TO NOW FIND YOU CLOSED!~  The only reason I've paid your prices in the past is because you were a good last resort.  Now you're just "last".Note to self: never go here again.  Tell 100 friends to never go here again, how they just "take off" on a Sunday night.  That's called word-of-mouth, pal, and you or your "gone fishin' " staff just earned some muy, muy mal word-of-mouth.
3	Breakfast sandwiches and burritos are very good.  I had the Buffalo Chicken sandwich for lunch and it was tasty too.  Customer service is bad to good but never great.  They make the food when you order it, so you will have to wait a bit longer than in a fast food restaurant but its worth it if you value freshly cooked food.  This store has a huge selection of liquors and wines and one shot mini bottles too.
