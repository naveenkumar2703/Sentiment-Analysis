1	It's unfortunate that I have to write a bad review- but I believe it's important to get this out there. This is especially for those that are non-locals. Thursday night, my friend and I needed a ride back to our hotel. It was already late and we could not take the light rail back because it had already made its last round.Strike 1: Driver did not know where he was going & he was on his cell phone asking for directions.Strike 2: I knew that he knew a more direct way to get to our hotel; instead he chose to take a scenic route through a residential area. Therefore, making the drive longer than it should have been. Strike 3: THE METER WAS NOT RUNNING. So he basically just said a random price when we got to our hotel.We were picked up in the US AIRWAYS CENTER and our hotel was on Central & Osborn. We paid $12 for the fare; I guess I should assume that is a decent price. However, the service was unacceptable from my perspective. The meter should have been on.PS. they also DBA as Elite Taxi Cab.
1	If you have to be some place on time, don't use them.  I called at 2pm for a 4:15 taxi to arrive.  At 4:25 they were calling me saying he was right around the corner, and gave me his location.  Estrella called a couple more times to "verify my address".  At 4:35 I called them and cancelled the cab and got a ride from my neighbor.  As we pulled out of my neighborhood, we PASSED the cab. He had taken a street that he thought was going to be a through street and got himself lost. This is a TAXI service, they should know how to get around the valley!!  Don't these people use GPS, or MAPS at least?!?!?!?  End of story, I was still late for my class that I paid 250.00 bucks for. I was not allowed in, and the money is non refundable.  So thanks Estrella wasting my time and costing me money.  WORST TAXI SERVICE EVER.
