4	I just went this morning for a vibradermabrasion (my sister gifted me a groupon) and was really happy with the service.  Michelle was the Aesthetician and not only was she sweet and friendly, but she never pushed any products nor made me feel like I was anything less than a 'full-price' customer, which honestly is the ONLY reason I DO NOT buy Groupons for beauty/aesthetic services (I learned my lesson!).  The place itself is conveniently located near my work and the ambiance is elegant (but not over the top) and welcoming; the front staff were friendly and prompt.  The business is also a Women's Care center (OBGYN, I think), so there were a few pregger moms in the waiting room.  Michelle will definitely be getting my return business - she was gentle, very informative, had good advice and tips for face care, and pleasant to do business with.  The facility was up to par and with all that said, I'm looking forward to returning there for business.
