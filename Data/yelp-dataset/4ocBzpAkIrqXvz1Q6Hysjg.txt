4	Good place to go to pick up a quick dinner.  There's usually a wait for breadsticks- but it's cheaper than even going to McDonalds!  The pizza isn't amazing- but it's okay for $5!
4	How can you argue with a $5 meal? There's better pizza out there, but at 3 times the cost. Definitely the best bet for feeding a family. I've actually grown fond of their pizza. They have an online coupon that will get you free sauce your breadsticks. There's a wait about fifty percent of the time, but it doesn't last more than 3-5 minutes. Usually it's not because of the employees, it's because some dim-wit at the front of the line can't decide what they want to order...at a place that only has about six different things you can order.
3	You pay 5 bucks for a large pep pizza and 3 bucks for.crazy bread. You have aeal for.2 or 3 under 8 bucks. Its.not the highest quality but for quick amd easy pizza it is a great deal. I'd rather go here and spend 2 minites inside waiting to pick up my pizza rather than 20 at most other places
4	What's there not to love about a 5 dollar pizza made ready for pick up? Mind you, this review is based soley off the hot and ready pizzas, along with their crazy bread. I must admit I've never ordered their chicken wings, deep dish pizza, etc.I like that there's a lot of parking at this location, they open at 10:30am and the employees here are always very cheerful an seem to enjoy their jobs.The crazy bread.... Oh the crazy bread! This is the best type of breadstick I have vet had. They are so soft and covered in buttery deliciousness. I can't resist picking up a bag of these things each time I come in.The only reason I'm giving this place 4 out of 5 stars is because the "hot and READY" pizzas sometimes aren't ready when you order them.
