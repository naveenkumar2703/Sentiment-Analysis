5	OMG!  Late night snack and we were in the area...I tried the shrimp, fish, rice, cabbage and ranch HUGE burrito, IT WAS AMAZING!!!  And only $4.99!  I added lime and green salsa, it was so good!!!
2	This restaurant chain is.. Decent. My bf and I have visited this location a couple times when we are craving mexican food and can't find anything else. The beef tacos are pretty darn good but everything else is just ok. Beans and rice are very.... Bland just like their customer service. Now that I have discovered los taquitos on 48th and elliot featured on Diners,Drive-ins,and Dives. Boy is their carne asada worth the trip and gas. No more mediocre mexican cuisine!
5	I usually go there . Everything its good  exept when u buy  alot of stuff  they never give good enough sauce  2  at least per person
1	This place was terrible!!! They took over 15 minutes to get the food.. We ended up leaving after paying without the food because they weren't wearing gloves and kept touching lifting up their pants! I will never eat at this place ever again!!
4	Damn you perfectly delicious, mouthwatering wallet friendly chile relleno burro. I can never have enough of you!! Service is definitely friendlier & quicker at this location then the one off of 16th St/ McDowell.
