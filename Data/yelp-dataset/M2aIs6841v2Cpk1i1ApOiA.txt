1	How hard is it to get a decent review for dry cleaning?Drop off clothes, pick it, looks clean, BAM 3-4 stars right. Drop off clothes, seems clean. Crease on suit is not the same place so the crease looks off now. Alterations: don't go here for that, I had them sew up a pocket on dress pants that seem to be coming loose. I got it back and it looked half down, missing a stich like the other pocket that was not ripped. She responds " I am not a miracle worker" WTH does that mean, it's a stich on a machine not parting the red sea. Attitude with bad service = bad review.
