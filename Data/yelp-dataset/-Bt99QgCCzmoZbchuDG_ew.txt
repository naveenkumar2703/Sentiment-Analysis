5	Great group of people. Fun events. Jason is an awesome organizer.
5	If I could give more than 5 stars I would. I love this group. VMG is a free group for people to get out and meet new people. It's not a dating group, but a social group. Although the name is Valley Movie Group we do all kinds of events; plays, ballet, spots games, comedy, dinners, and of course movies. The people are incredibly nice, the group is well organized, and we always get group discounts on what we are doing. Check it out, you will not be sorry.
5	I always have a great time when I'm at a Valley Movie Group event.  The people in the group are friendly, and I usually have some great conversations. Jayson, the group's organizer, makes everyone feel welcome and has a gift for remembering people's names.  He is not just gifted when it comes to people's names, he successfully gathers large groups of people for movies and other events and negotiates discounts at restaurants after the movie.  On a side note, last time I was there, I was having a bad day due to a flaky friend cancelling at the last minute for meeting up with me.  While I initially felt angry, his words of encouragement made me feel better.
