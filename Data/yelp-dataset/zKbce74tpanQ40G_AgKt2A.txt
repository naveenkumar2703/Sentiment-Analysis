4	This gas station doesn't have the best prices but I like stopping here for coffee, energy drinks, lotto, etc...They don't have those window salesman that hassle you and the service is always good.
4	In terms of gas stations I like this one the best. The service clerks are nice and helpful, the pumps are easy to use, and there is never a wait. I didn't used to be picky about my gas until I had some costly fuel system repairs and several mechanics made the statement to only use Chevron gas when possible. It's true that you'll spend a little more per gallon, but the quality of the fuel will help maintain your engine and cost you less in repairs in the long run.
5	I have just started using this gas station in the last few months.  It is right on the corner of Rural and Baseline , very convenient i must say. The best part is they always have very good prices.    You have a full little convenient store inside.   Also, they have a car wash not the greatest.... But, it is good when you need the dust off.
5	I like this place, It is close to home. Plus it is open whenever i need them. But, sorry to say i do not know the hours. Gas is a really good price here compared to a lot of other Chevron's near by.  They also have a full mini mart inside as well as a   car wash. Not the best but good when you are in a hurry. Great location,right on the corner.
