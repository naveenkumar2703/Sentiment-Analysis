3	I have been wanting to stop by this place for quite some time, but it seems every time I am in this plaza, Electric Ladyland is closed. Let me start by saying that this store reminds me of those moms that want to be young forever so they go and get manicures and their hair done with their teenagers and act like they are best friends with their kids friends. Yeah.. you know what I am talking about.. they wear velour pants and shirts that say "Blondie and loving it" or "Princess" .. They shop here. This store had a few cute David and Goliath shirts. I got an orange one that says "Miss Miserable" on it. They were having a major sale so I got it for like $16. Everything else was really overpriced. The store was REALLY warm. I am not sure if the AC was turned off or what, but I was sweating.They did have a cool shop, and the bags they send you away in are really awesome. It has been sitting on my counter for three days.I'm pretty sure I would never shop here again unless I become one of those mama's.
1	Who are they kidding? $475 jeans that looked like they came from Kmart and a brand I didn't recognize... This place is crap. Techno music and strobe lights blasting so loud I couldn't stand to try anything on... Drove by yesterday and saw they were closed. Shocking.
