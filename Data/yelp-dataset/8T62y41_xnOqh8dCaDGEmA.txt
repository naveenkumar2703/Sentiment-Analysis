4	What unique little spot on State?! Nostalgia for my college years got the better of me, so mom and I took an afternoon to drive down and shop a bit and eat a bit more ;) In between our snacking and walking, a beautiful scarf caught my mom's eye in the window of this gallery, so we walked in. As she perused the options, I took to checking out all of the handcrafted jewelry and small pieces of artwork. Everything in the store was carefully crafted and gorgeous, not to mention unique. For an afternoon during the week, it was pretty busy, but nonetheless, the clerk was very friendly and helpful. If you are looking for a great gift for someone with great taste that will really knock their socks off, Fanny Garver Gallery just may have it. Check it out!
5	The folks at Fanny Garver run a gallery for the right reason: to connect people to art that speaks for them.  Hits: incredibly personable, knowledgeable, and caring people who host a carefully curated collection of diverse pieces.  Misses: n/aHints: take advantage of their connection to artists who live or have lived in the midwest as well as their abillity to move pieces from nationally and internationally collected artists.  Bottomline: a national level gallery on state street.
