5	Professional, friendly and fast. Very customer oriented. I was running late, and they kept the doors open for me top pick up my order after hours. I will use them again and again.
5	I am so, so, utterly happy with this company that I must share my experience. I was on an impossible deadline with an event the next day and no time to pull collateral from inventory and ship to the event, so I decided to have collateral reprinted in the city of the event (Phoenix). I talked to two companies before I opted to go with Techniprint. I sent my 5 different documents to Techniprint and they came through! We worked together lock and step through the proof process and they were able to deliver on what seemed like an impossible deadline. That you for making me, as a marketer look good, and thank you for producing the quality that our company expects. I will search for more opportunities to use Techniprint again. Thank you Art and Bobby for your impeccable service.
5	Another satisfied customer! I was referred to Techniprint about a year ago for a project I wanted to put on canvas and they did wonderful then and now they outshined once more. Blew up 3 prints that I had them scan 2-3 times the original size & print on canvas. They came out absolutely perfect! They look so good that the framers at Michael's asked me where I got them done so here's a referral Techniprint!
5	Rick and the guys and gals at Techniprint never fail to deliver amazing customer service and great printed pieces! My company has been working with them for several years and we can't help but continue to use them! Many times I have less than 24 hours to get our collateral printed, and every time they deliver! Can't thank you guys enough!
