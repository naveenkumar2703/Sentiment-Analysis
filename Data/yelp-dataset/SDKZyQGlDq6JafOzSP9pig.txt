4	You want quality work at great prices look no further! My husband wanted a spur of the moment birthday tat so we went to Homeward Bound as our son knew one of the artists there. She had already left for the evening but the owner took care of us. Proffesional, clean, friendly and fair! We will definately be returning for more ink and sending our friends there as well. Check them out!
