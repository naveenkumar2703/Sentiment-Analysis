5	Now, I am not much to write about chain fast food restaurants, but I felt that I should give a shout out to the Saturday night crew. I pulled up and they were busy in the drive through. The girl taking orders was fast, very courteous, and offered extra fixings on something I didn't actually know you could get extras on. When I pulled up to the window I was greeted by 2 different people which is rare, sometimes at fast food joints you can barely get a total out of the person at the window. I watched how they were operating as a team and having worked in fast food before, I found it to be a well oiled machine. When you're scored on every second of a transaction, that counts. Props to the girls working on the floor that night. And my ice cream was good too :)
