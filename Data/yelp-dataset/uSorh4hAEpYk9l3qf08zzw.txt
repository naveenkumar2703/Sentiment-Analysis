4	This is the convenience store attached to the Shell Gas station where I usually fill the cars up. It really is convenient since it's down the street from where I live, in the same area as the supermarket, Rocco's, the dry cleaners and across the street from Discovery Park.  They also have a Post Office Express inside, in case you don't feel like making that trip to the Post Office.
1	Unfortunately the employees are rude! For such a nice area near my home, I am sad to see that this gas station has hired two very rude women to work behind the counters. I am not expecting much from gas station employees in general, but these women were over the top rude. I wont be back. 6/14/12 10:20 AM The owner should check the records and know who was working at the above time and date- and seriously re-think having these two work here.
3	I would give City Stop four stars since their mini-post office saves my lazy butt from making a trip to a real post office.  The best part is you can drop stuff off there anytime and they will take care of it for you.  They have priority boxes available if you need them.BUT they changed from Shell to Sinclair and I'm not happy about it.  I'm picky with the gas I put in my car and for some reason I don't like Sinclair.There is a mini-mart as well, but I find it pointless when you have Smiths in the same parking lot.
