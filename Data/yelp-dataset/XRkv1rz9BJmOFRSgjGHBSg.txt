5	This place is amazing! My brother-in-law lives a 3-minute walk away from this place, and boy, am I glad he does otherwise we would have never found it! I was having some severe poker withdrawal, and finally came here on a Monday night with my husband, his brother and our friend. They had just finished a Monday night tourney that started at 7pm. We were supposed to make it for that, but got caught up with errands. We arrived around 9:00pm, and played a 10-man 1/2 cash game. All the players we met that night were very cordial, good sport and fun to play with. The dealers, dapper in their matching purple button-downs, were very professional and polite. The establishment was very clean and well-maintained. While we were playing, one of the dealers was cleaning and asking if any of us needed drinks. There were a few TV screens tuned into ESPN, a kitchenette, coffeemaker, water dispenser and fridge. They provide pretzels and a few other snacks, free of charge. I highly recommend this poker room! It's a friendly spot with good people.
5	No rake, no annual membership or fees.  Just a fun "home" game in a strip mall minutes from my parents' house.  They have 1-2 and 2-3 NL games and the min buy is $40, max is $500. Everyone is friendly and they offered us snacks and drinks while we played.  Since there isn't a rake or fee, don't be cheap (like one guy there) and tip the dealer generously.
1	Shenanigans!!!Something stinks on 32nd St and it is this card club.  You'll haven't seen so many wild hands since the days that online poker was fixed.  If a card room is playing with a standard 52 card deck why the crazy number of quads and straight flushes?  Take heed yelpers and take your business elsewhere.
