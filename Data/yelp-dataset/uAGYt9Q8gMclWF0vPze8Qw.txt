5	Went to Court's shop at the old location once before and provided amazing service, as I have listed on my previous review. Came to the new location today to get a Crimestoppers Remote starter installed in my '14 Corolla S. Waited two hours as stated prior to installation. Waiting area was nice, there was A/C and water was offered. Friendly staff. Everyone was very professional; I would def. recommend 808 Car audio evolution. Thanks again guys!
5	Very happy with services hey provided me.  They did a car alarm install the same day I came in just to inquire about prices. I have been actively shopping around for 5 weeks. They are a true one stop shop.  Courtney was very informative and willing to help answer all my questions.Please pay them a visit.  Highly recommend them.
5	Amazing service!  Very quick and friendly! Had a car alarm installed and after a couple of months it started acting up. I brought it back and they installed an upgraded version free of charge! They're really passionate about their service and that is truly hard to find now a days. Definitely 5/5 :)
5	I went to Courteney last August 2013 and inquired about a custom sub box for my car. Being that my car is a yaris, I wanted to keep the spare and have a functional trunk. He made a custom box with my specifications and haven't had any problems. He told me the job would take the entire day - that's fine. When the job was done, he gave me a call and asked if I could pick up the car. I couldn't and when he heard that, he offered to drive my car to my house! What amazing customer service. Courteney is friendly and did a great job. I would definitely recommend him to friends and for future stereo install. Thanks bud!
