3	Every once in a while I stray from my normal breakfast of a bowl of Cheerios and a glass of orange juice.  Mostly on weekends and usually for something healthy.  But once in a while you just need greasy fast food.  Jack does that about as well as anybody.  And my faith in him was reaffirmed as my favorite breakfast sandwich (sourdough), while no longer on the menu, is still available.  I have been stopping at this location for breakfast on occasion for the last 15 years.  It is starting to show a little wear around the edges and this morning I noticed the whole dining room had been rearranged and sort of looks weird because it no longer matches the footprint of the carpet.
1	NOT a fan of this Jack in the box at all! I went through the drive through and all i wanted was a milkshake. I was clear with my words and she had no idea what i wanted. She took forever to respond too. After she found out what i wanted, they werent serving it. This has happened a couple times now and its really annoying that their employees cant understand whats on the menu that i am ordering.
