1	My daughter and son bought their Dad a pedicure for Father's Day this past year. Last weekend was the first time he was able to use it. A lady worked on my husband's feet. The experience was alright for him, but the next day my husband complained that his feet were killing him. When he got home and took his shoes off, his toes were bleeding!!!!! Apparently they over did it when they pushed back the cuticles. His feet bled for 3 days!!!!!!!! This was supposed to be a pleasant experience, but never again will he ever get a pedicure. My daughter felt so bad that she went to talk to the manager about what had happened and even showed pictures of his feet that were bleeding on her cell phone. All they could say was they were sorry. Obviously they don't care about whether they have our business or not. I was expecting them to at least give us a free pedicure or maybe a discount for the next time. At least that is what most good reputable businesses would do to keep a customer. We will never go back there again and we will let all of our friends know that they are an awful place to get nails done, especially for the first time.

5	I've been coming here for four years, and I absolutely love this place. Friendly, professional, everyone here makes you feel welcome and the owner is amazing! This is the only place I have ever been that has given me perfect eyebrows, and I would never go anywhere else as long as they are in business.
