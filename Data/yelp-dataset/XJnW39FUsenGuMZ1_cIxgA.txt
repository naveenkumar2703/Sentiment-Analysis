3	I am a HUGE fan of Subway, but this particular branch never seems to have all the ingredients!If they've not run out of all-but-one type of bread, it's lettuce, or it's chicken. I mean come on guys! Help me out here!!Plus I've always noticed that this particular Subway is used by all the schoolkids in the area, so is always busy and is always messy. There is a brilliant one  mere 10mins walk away - it's worth it!
