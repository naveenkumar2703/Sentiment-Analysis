3	I'm reasonalby sure that Jack puts crack in those tacos.  99 cents for two tacos is crazy!  And yes, I know they are kind of greasy and they don't use the most amazing ingrediants but there is something about them.....My other favorite item is the chicken fajita pita.  It's a great option if you don't want a burger.  The fries are decent and they have a nice variety of options to choose from. And I must admit Jack's commercials are funny. Thanks Jack!
1	This is the worst Jack in the Box around.  The customer service at this place is consistently terrible, to the point that I stopped going long ago.  Half the issue is having employees whose English is unintelligible.  If you can't understand English - which is the language of this land (last time I checked, anyway), how is a person reasonably expected to be able to correctly take an order?  One time I was there, I asked for 2 Jumbo Jacks, hold the mayo.  I had to repeat myself 4 times to the attendant before they finally understood.  When I got home, the burgers were slathered with mayonnaise.  Another time I got 2 regular burgers instead of the sandwich I had ordered.Another time, apparently it was a shift change and I stood there for several minutes, waiting for someone to help me. All of the employees were RIGHT there, completely ignoring customers at the counter.  The last time I went, I again requested no mayo.  This time, however, when they handed me my bag full of food, I opened it up and laid it all out on the counter and then began opening each item (I was buying for 4 teenagers besides myself, I had a lot of food there).  My burgers were again slathered with mayo.  I called the manager of this store a couple of times hoping they might be able to get this place in order, but that dream never materialized.  I no longer go to this Jack in the Box and go to the one at 24th Street and Baseline instead (MUCH better service there with people that actually speak English!).
