3	I love trying out new nail salons in my area.  I had a coupon for a special they were running. 32.99 for fill and spa pedicure...not a bad deal.  The decor is very nice, the spa chairs looked new and the nail tables looked kept.  Tony my master nail tech did a great job.  Didn't rush my services and didn't try to sell me the gel or the newest thing which instead of costing 19.00 it's 35.00.  I hate that.  My spa pedicure was kinda of relaxing, loved the massage chair, but the big screen TV was dominated by their son so we all watched cartoons.  I got the regular pedicure and no special services like hot rock massage were added.  It was pretty basic.  I know other salons in the area usually add that service as part of the basic package.  It would of been nice if they offered water. All in all, I got exactly what I wanted and they did a great job.
