1	Terrible Nasty Trashy Place
1	Not a very good place at all.  Be very careful of this place as they tack on all kinds of move-out charges.  They make you show a receipt that the apartment has been "professionally cleaned" when move out.  I had my neighbor clean the place as she did an exceptional job.  Because she is not a registered cleaning company, they charged me $130 for not having a registered company clean the apartment.  Also, make sure that you pay rent before the first of the month if it falls on a holiday.  They charged me $75 for not paying them on time because they were closed on the first of the month.  Because they decided to close on the first, they charged other tenants and I $75 for supposedly paying late.  Be very careful if you decide to live at this apartment complex.
1	Worst place I have ever lived. No water half the time. No A/C the other time. The staff is here to make sure they get paid only and do not care about your problems.  I can't wait to move.
