3	Conveniently located on the corner of Buffalo and Cheyenne, I like to stop by this gas station when I fill up my car at night.  The lighting is very good and the pump area is wide open so that you can see very easily.  Safety is important to me and this one is the most safe for late night fill ups.There are other amenities here as well.....convenience store, small car wash, video poker machines.  The brand of gas is Chevron and it is competitively priced close to the lowest price in the neighborhood.  I will return when I'm out and about and need a late night fill.
3	I was filling up at my local Smiths store but when my engine started knocking I switched to Chevron with Tecron and it magically disappeared.  This location is at the corner of Cheyenne and Tenya and is less than a block from my GFs so I stop here a few times a week for gas, and slurpies and other junk food items.Its well-lit at night so I feel comfortable getting out of my car and pulling out my wallet to use the machines.  I had a problem with one of the card readers and the staff was quick to respond and had the gas going in no time.  For a  gas station what else could you ask for?
3	This is a nice gas station. Everything seems clean inside and out. The store is well stocked and always had Vanilla Coke, which I am addicted to but have such a hard time finding in Vegas. They also have a car wash here that is pretty good for a drive thru style.
4	Had to go here after my debacle at Rebel. Lady was very nice, and had other people complain to her about the floor situation at Rebel. This place is a lot cleaner than Rebel is overall a better choice. The gas prices are a little higher, but it's better quality gas than at Rebel too.
