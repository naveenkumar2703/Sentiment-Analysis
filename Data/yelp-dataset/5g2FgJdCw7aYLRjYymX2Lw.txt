5	Dear Marshalls,   You will always be my FAVORITE store no matter what happens. I love your style and the great deals you get me. I never fail to find something I love in your store and that is true love. Keep offering those great deals and I will certainly keep a special place for you in my heart and wallet. Sincerely,  Lauren "The Shopaholic" J
5	LOVE THIS MARSHALLS! I can and have spent hours in this store, they always have what I am looking for, what I need, what I think I need and more. Best prices from purses to bedding and unlike other Marshall's they are organized and helpful. I rarely go to any other store for clothes, shoes, or home decor because they always have the best of everything.
3	I like Marshalls. I have good luck finding athletic wear and handbags there. The store is clean and pretty organized. I can always find staff to help me if I have a question.
5	I absolutely love Marshall's! They have tons of everything, from clothing to Candles. I especially love the dressing rooms with the "not for me" "maybe" and "definitely"! Every time I go there I never leave empty handed. Thank you for being awesome!
