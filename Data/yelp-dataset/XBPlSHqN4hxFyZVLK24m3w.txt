5	My little lady (and by little lady, I mean my two hundred pound, 6'2 construction worker) and I had a 90 minute massage here. Little lady had Zaz, a male exotic dancer from France, and I had Lifan, both were professional, friendly, and excellent at what they do. Lifan's style was more shiatsu (elbow grinding and pinching). Their beds are located in a medical office complex in downtown Henderson, the massage rooms are large and have a much better ambiance than most small, non-hotel spas I've been to in Vegas. The masseuses are attentive and will adjust their pressure to your requests, wrap your feet in hot towels, use hot stones, etc., etc. Overall, really excellent and competitively priced- $100 for 90 minutes, 10% of your second visit. They have a strict cancellation policy and will charge you the full price of your scheduled treatment if you do not cancel within four hours of your appointment. My only complaint is the odd location.
4	my fiancee & i came here for a couples massage.  as far as massages go, it was great!  both of us enjoyed it and felt very relaxed and comfortable.  we had two women (i can't recall their names) but both were professional and good.  i agree with the other yelper that the location is a little off, but we wanted something off the strip and live locally in henderson.  i'm giving my fiancee the hot stone therapy today for her bday - will update this review after that!  pricing is moderate, not cheap, but compared to the strip very reasonable.
4	I had Zaz for an awesome 60 mins massage, twice and he is exceptional! I'm very picky with my massages so I was a skeptic at first, given that the spa is in an odd location in Henderson, inside what looks like an corporate office building, but Zaz's work cancels out the odd location! He's great, knows exactly which muscles to tend to to make sure he gets to your tense areas and is very professional! I'll def follow him wherever he goes!!
