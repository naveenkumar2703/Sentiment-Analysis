5	I had a great experience with Dr Mullen.  I went in for a shoulder issue, and wasn't even finished with my initial paperwork before I was being called out of the waiting room for x-rays. Very thorough in his explanation of what was going on, got right to the source of the problem and gave me my treatment options.
