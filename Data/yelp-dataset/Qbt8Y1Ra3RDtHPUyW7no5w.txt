3	Anything to make my life easier is key for me, and Walgreens does that when it comes to two things: one, the Walgreens iPhone app for uploading photos and choosing when I'll pick them up, and two, being down the street at the next intersection from home. Walgreens is like a CVS...a drive-thru pharmacy, and basic necessities with the prices jacked up to match your desperation when you walk in the door. Back East, the Walgreens stores were like a CVS on steroids; in this general area, though, the CVS at 16th St and Camelback is nicer. Some drawbacks to this location are not being as clean as Walgreens is known for, and seemingly cluttered and disorganized.
1	Pharmacy: They only have 1 person staffing this location. Takes more than 30 minutes to fill a Rx.
5	Very friendly cashiers. I love it when you go somewhere and you can tell employees love their job.  I experienced 2 very pleasant customer service representatives and my cashier was eager to encourage the sale special. Coupons are such a fun bonus!
