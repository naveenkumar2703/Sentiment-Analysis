4	My first tattoo was done by John. He was really cool and kept me occupied with conversations that made me and my best friend hysterical with laughter. For my first tattoo I had a simple clover on my foot, and it didn't hurt like many said it would, plus he was so fast that I was in and out pretty quick. He talked me out of swirls, which after seeing what they would have looked like, I am glad of now.I am satisfied with it overall, and the price which was about 80$ with tip.
5	The artists at Battle Born are awesome.  My husband had his first tattoo done (at 35) by Jon in June and has almost completed a full sleeve now.  I've had two tattoos done and couldn't be happier.  I give him an idea and let him run with it... He's an amazing artist.  The rest of the gang in the shop are great and it's always a good time.
5	I was visiting from out of town and popped into Battle Born Tattoo on a random Sunday after being referred by a friend. I didn't have an appointment but from the second I walked in Britney was super welcoming and accommodating. I wanted a small, one word tattoo and she drew it up for me on the spot and it was exactly what I had pictured in my head. She was very thorough in cleaning everything and setting the exact placement of the tattoo. She made sure I was comfortable while she was working on me and she just has a chill, laid back vibe that made the whole experience very relaxing. The tattoo looked (and still looks) fabulous and healed perfectly. I live in LA but will be making the drive to Vegas for my next tattoo - Britney is that good and I won't go to anyone else!
