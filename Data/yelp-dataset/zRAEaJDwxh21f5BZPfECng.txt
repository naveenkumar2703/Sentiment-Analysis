5	Fast and friendly service! Professional clean work. They won't disappoint and are very affordable. I would recommend A-List Carpet Care for your next carpet cleaning.
5	Wish i could give them 10 stars! I have used a half a dozen carpet cleaners over last several years. None of them compare to a list! Carpets perfectly cleaned. They even got a coffee stain out! Look forward to their next visit. Very professional and arrived on time!
5	Living in L.A. and having a 2nd home in Vegas, I've noticed that home service providers tend to charge more in Vegas, and most deliver less.  After hiring A-List to clean my carpets in Vegas, my theory WAS PROVEN WRONG.   When scheduling an appt., I called on a Monday morning at about 7:30 and left a message.  Al called back immediately.  Per my request for an estimate, Al offered to come by and give an estimate; however, because I was out of town, Al gave me an estimate on the phone based on square footage of carpeting/  He scheduled an appt. for the following Sunday morning (since I was there only for the weekend), showed up early, was friendly, thorough, and TRUSTWORTHY.   His estimate was very competitive to other carpet cleaners, but he did not try to upsell me, and he actually charged me LESS than his estimate.  Most definitely I will use him again, and not because of his price, but because of the quality and thoroughness of his work.   AL, you and Aydin did a great job for me.  THANK YOU!
