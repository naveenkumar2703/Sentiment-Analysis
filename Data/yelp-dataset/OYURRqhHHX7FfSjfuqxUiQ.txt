3	Its an Arco station so gas pricing is pretty much the cheapest around here. Not dirty but decent for being a gas station. What I like here is it doesn't matter what time or what day I stop in the cashier is always perky, and friendly. Particularly at 4 am that's a nice start to the day.
3	Gas prices here are generally among the lowest in the area and I like using their $7 automatic carwash.
1	The gas is usually the cheapest here. HOWEVER, it's a scam cause there's a 35 cent charge to use your debit card. And it's a 1.00 charge to use your credit card. And...their canned drinks are the most expensive around. I love Arco AMPM, but this one is the worst around.
