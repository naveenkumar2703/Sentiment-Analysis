1	As a loyal Terrible customer, I hesitate to write this review, but I got over it.I stopped by this store to get a quick oil change. Here's what I got in addition to the service.* They left my glove box on the floor of the car after checking the cabin air filter..* They failed to reset the maintenance schedule warning.The manager was actually surly when processing my bill.Never again!
4	i actually went to the one on sahara ave, but i'm sure this one is run the same way.$15/mo for unlimited car-washes?  in hawaii, we'd pay an arm and a leg for that.i don't know about other stations here, but the carwash deal they have is awesome in my opinion. the car wash procedure is so easy like a, b, c.. you just drive up to the guy at the window, he meets you on the other side to scrub your car a little and you drive right through.   it's quick, convenient and the best part is that you can go as much as you want to, like daily.  i give the wash itself 3.5 stars because it doesn't dry too well.
