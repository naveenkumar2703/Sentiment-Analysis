5	This Boutique is fabulous and Ahhhmazing! Adorable home decor, unique gifts, great priced clothing and jewelry, spa and wine accessories and much more. This store has a welcoming vibe with a great staff. Kind of reminds me of an 'Anthropology' store but better prices :) Love the tops and dresses they carry. Ahwatukee's best kept secret! It's under new ownership so the whole store has been updated! Liked it before, love it now! Located next to Trader Joe's so I stop by anytime I'm in the area :)
