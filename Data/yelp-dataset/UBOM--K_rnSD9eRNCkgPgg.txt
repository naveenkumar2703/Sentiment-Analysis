1	I would not recommend them for remodels.  I was very disappointed.  they fixed it but I was told they were doing me a favor by fixing it.  three months to do a 5x8 bathroom.  NO COMMUNICATION AT ALL!!!!!!!  Over priced by alot.  Even Arizona Shower Doors had comments to make about them.
5	Love this location, can't go 10 feet without an employee asking if I need help! They also know what they are talking about if you have a question.
4	Quick and convenient, I've been given some bum advice about products and I think Home Depot is better for serious projects, so 4 stars.  Oh yeah don't waste your time with Valspar (lowes brand) paint it is beyond doubt inferior to Behr premium.
1	Disappointed with the way management handled my returns. They would not accept returns from the Goodyear store in order to honor a coupon I had just received in the mail. I had spent over $1000 in 2 days there. You would think they would try to accommodate me.
