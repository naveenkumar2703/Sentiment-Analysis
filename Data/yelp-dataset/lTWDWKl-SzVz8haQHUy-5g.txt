5	Roger came out and optimized my home theater setup and programmed my programmable remote control (MX-650). He also fixed a bad electrical outlet we had while he was here.
5	Our experience with Roger, The Home Theater Doctor, has been very positive. He is very knowledgable and reliable.
5	Found Roger's company on the internet and checked to see how he was rated.  He is rated highly, has good references, is listed on Angie's list, and I found lots of great comments.I will add mine to those.   I needed him to help me set up a single remote, a Harmony One, so that it would operate all of the activities and functions.     Roger knew what he was doing, checked everything to make sure it worked, and made sure I was satisfied. Having him complete that effort was worth every $ !!!!!     Thanks Roger!!!
5	Roger came out quickly and solved our problem. After dealing with the Geek Squad, I would definitely call the Home Theater Doctor again.
5	Roger was great. Got my system up and running again . Great price too! I highly recommend his company.
5	Roger just finished a custom installation for me mounting two flat screens with surround sound that included in-wall wiring. Roger was on time, on budget and the installation was flawless. He doesn't take shortcuts and he arrived with all the tools and parts needed. I would recommend The Home Theater Doctor to anyone needing audio/video work.
5	Roger was on time for his appointments and called in advance.  He was polite and, most importantly, he knew what he was doing.  We called him for maintenance of a system installed by someone else.  He made good suggestions that were appropriate for our system and budget.  His pricing was fair and disclosed in advance.  We would definitely call Roger again, whether it would be for a tweak of our system, maintenance issues, or a complete re-design.
5	Roger was great, on time professional and got the job done. Highly recommend him to get the job done. Flexible and cost effective.
