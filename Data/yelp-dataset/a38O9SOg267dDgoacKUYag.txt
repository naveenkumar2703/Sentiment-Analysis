5	Very professional, knowledgeable guy with a mobile computer repair service. Found Rob's number in New Times and he told me his rate on the phone and said he would be at my place between 2 and 2:30pm and would call when he was on the way. All this proved true and my computer was cleared of some nasty virus that it got from me clicking on a bad link on a website (probably Craigslist). The cost was only $120 and he finished the job in less than an hour. He explained everything in layman's terms and even put on some free spyware to hopefully fend off future incidents. Rob knows his stuff and this was a good experience that worked out great.
5	Rob is the man!! I had a big virus issue on both my computers, called him, and he came to help me the very same day. Very knowledgable of his job, solved my problem in less than 2 hours. The final surprise, his rates are very fair. If you need a technician don't hesitate. Call him and you'll be extremely satisfied. Alberto.
5	Rob was so nice to deal with. I called him on the phone about a computer problem. He walked me through the steps and my computer was fixed.What a nice guy!
