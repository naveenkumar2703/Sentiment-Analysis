1	This place is horrible!  They treat you like dirt!  Im not sure if its the fact that there are only 10 people in there or that they dont make money but either way, they wont make a penny from me!   They are rude and condescending!  They are very pushy with their prices and if you dont buy what they are selling they get angry!   Thought a strip club was meant to have a good time.  Instead, I had the worst expeirence ever!  I work in the industry in Vegas and about 20 people ask me where to go to see girls everynight!  I will never send anyone that way again!  Go to Hustler, Bada Bing, Sapphires, Rhino, or Paridise but dont stop here!  You will have a better time anywhere else guarrenteed!

Decor was great and the staff was friendly.  It was happy hour until 11 and we enjoyed a few $4 cocktails while talking to the dancers.  By 10pm the club was up and running and a few other dudes wandered in.  Since it was a fight night and off the strip, I'll bet that this place peaks late if all, but there were just too few people here to stay after 11.One thing I like about this place is that the girls don't pressure you too hard about getting lap dances.  The one thing I don't like about this place is the unisex restroom.  It is a bit weird and confusing.
