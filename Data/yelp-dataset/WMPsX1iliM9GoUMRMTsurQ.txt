5	the view is as breathtaking as it looks and the food is XXXquisite!!! the soy glazed snapper was on point like acupuncture and their chzcake is almost as good as mine. very cool date place she was amazed and your girl will be too!!!!
3	The reason I chose to do my reception here is because my wedding was held on a Monday. I didn't realize that many of the clubs are closed on Mondays. We found that Paris and Mandalay Bay were going to be open, however Mandalay Bay was much more flexible with the actual contract. The lady we worked with was really awesome. She would bend over backwards to help us achieve the perfect night. My complaints are not with her but with the wait staff at The Mix Restaurant. Our waiter and the lady that we signed the contract with were not in sync. The menu that was created was not what we had discussed, slight modifications. We were supposed to have a premium open bar and we were only allowed certain selections. However, all in all the night went really well. I'm sure the guests didn't notice and everyone had a good time. We later contacted the lady who helped us plan and she made some things right, and gave us a free dinner there whenever we return. The views from this restaurant are so nice. I'm not sure I would recommend this necessarily, but I'm not completely disappointed.
5	Second time here with my girlfriend. Took my parents with me for their 38th anniversary. Service was amazing as usual and food was superb.
4	This place's prices were as high as it's breathtaking views of Las Vegas.  The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is that the price gouging was unusually high, even for Las Vegas.  But what a view!  Still VERY well worth it.
