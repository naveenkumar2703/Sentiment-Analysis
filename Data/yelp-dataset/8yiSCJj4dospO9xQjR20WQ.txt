4	The service is very friendly here. I usually pick up dog food here. The store is not very clean or organized, but again... The service is excellent.
4	I am a bit unqualified to review this place as it is mainly a farm supply store. That being said I will talk about what I am qualified to talk about snack foods! They had a cool selection of beef jerky and candy, so for my money this place is ok! Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
4	Just the smells of this place made me nostalgic for my hometown. This store has anything you need for your country needs such as: saddles, horse gear, camping gear, western wear for men and women, bird food, bales of hay, dog and cat supplies, outdoor tools just to name a few. The staff was helpful and friendly. We came here to get some joint supplements for our dog. I know that other pet stores are more abundant in this town, but it was nice to support a mom and pop type establishment.
