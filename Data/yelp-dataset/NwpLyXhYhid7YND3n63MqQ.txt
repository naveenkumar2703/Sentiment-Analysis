4	When I moved to Madison from New York I knew that I would have to give up one of my greatest love affairs: la comida criolla (or in English, the cuisine of Puerto Rico). I yearned for the smell of cuchifritos wafting through the air, inviting to partake in their crispy goodness. However, the fates were on my side for a change. Tropical Cuisine opened up and brought a taste of Puerto Rico to Madison. I just came from a delicious meal of Mofongo and Pernil and if I were not currently bursting at the seams I would still be there ordering everything off the menu. If you grew up with or are familiar with Puerto Rican food, this is just like Mom makes it. If not, come by and support this place! I for one can guarantee its authenticity and deliciousness.

What really impressed me, though, was how willing the server and the chef were to create a vegetarian version of their regular menu. Puerto Rican food is typically heavy on the meat, so you have to ask for something else. For me, they put together a mofongo dish with broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, peppers, onions in their creole sauce-- it was phenomenal.
