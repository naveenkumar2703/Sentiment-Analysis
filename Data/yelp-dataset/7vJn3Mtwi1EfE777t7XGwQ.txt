5	I wish they had this when I was younger cause I would have used it all the time. If you follow the link you can get all the info you want about it. I have used it a couple of times to go to the library and to get to Loloma station to catch a bus. I cannot think of anything bad to say about it, and if I could I wouldn't cause its free to use. And how can one bitch about something they are getting for nothing.
5	As a newbie to Scottsdale, a free trolley ride seemed like a no-brainer for acquainting myself with the area better.  The driver (Barb) was a great gal with a friendly and happy disposition, who all too happily answered all of my newbie queries, and even gave me a lot of useful tips for getting around the greater Scottsdale/Tempe area with minimum cost and confusion.  She was professional, courteous, knowledgeable, friendly, and an excellent ambassador for Scottsdale (though apparently she lives in Tempe and not Scottsdale).  One of the passengers who boarded while I was on my full-loop ride seemed either intoxicated or simply 'messed up' and fell off his seat twice.  Barb handled the situation very tactfully and with his best interest and safety in mind, though he was somewhat belligerent and resistant to her help.  She handled it really well, I thought.  I love that Scottsdale has this transportation option and think they've done a good job laying out the routes and timing.  And I love that the buses look like trolleys!  Fun stuff.
5	It's free, it takes you to old town, the driver is usually very friendly and will give you directions. Did I mention it's FREE?! The trolley we were on last needed more AC but hey, it was a FREE ride so I can't complain! Take the Trolley!
