5	I love going into this zumiez. The employees are always really cool and help me find everything I need. Whenever I need to get my fix of snowboard or skateboard stuff this is my favorite spot to go. Not to mention the huge variety of brands they have such as obey, lrg, rvca, and volcom. The styles are always fashion forward and current with the new trends. I'd recommend this place to any of my friends. Check it out for yourself.
5	I like shopping here since they have a great selection of OBEY clothing. Zumiez caters to those who love to skate, snowboard or surf. If you're looking for gear, they probably carry it! They are also big on the fashion that intertwines with these extreme sports. Brands you'll find here = OBEY, LRG, RVCA, VOLCOM, DaKine, Toms, DC, Neff, Vans, Nike, Element, Fox, Nixon, G-shock, Converse, Emerica, Fallen, Roxy, STUSSY, Billabong, Hurley and O'Neill (just to name a few)This location not only has the items I am looking for, but the customer service is great! The employees are very cool and were able to help me with everything I needed! I'd recommend this place if you are looking for any of the brands I mentioned earlier!If in dire need of an item, I'll be sure to look here!
3	I ended up at this Zumiez location while shopping for a long board as a present for someone. They didn't have what I wanted (came pretty close though) but the staff was very helpful and friendly. They also carry larger sized shoes...if you need a Size 13 men's shoe just ask and they will gladly check in the back for you.
