4	Interesting that the salesperson seemed to have no interest in me (I completed a full circle of the first room) until I said that I was new to the area and this was my first visit to this store.  Then the gates opened, literally, as she invited me to see another two rooms across the courtyard.  This is a wonderfully French and quaint store, with beautiful and unusual [read that, "very expensive"] French antiques and furniture with some new gift items thrown in.  Everything in the store is merchandised well and very pleasing to the eye.  The background music was perfect as well.  If I'd had more money, I could have spent a WHOLE LOT OF IT at this store.  However, I did settle on a few small things for a gift basket for a friend.  It's one of those places where you go to dream.
3	Pretty things, ridiculously expensive.  If you have the discretionary funds to overpay, you'll have fun here!  Otherwise, you can find quality, similar (if not the same) products elsewhere, where they haven't been marked up 400-500% !  Meanwhile, it's a lovely store & enjoyable to visit.
