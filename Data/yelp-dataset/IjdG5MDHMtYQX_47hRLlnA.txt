4	Great store- nicely organized, always clean, and nice friendly staff (welcoming smiles and "Are you finding everything alright?" greetings). Convenient location- near Best Buy, Barnes & Noble, and Seafood City (the Blvd. Mall is just around the corner). Like I said, everything is in order, everything is relatively easy to find, and the clearance prices are cleared marked. The store is a good size store with ample space. The client base is surprisingly normal. There is a nice selection of cards, for birthdays- females or males- (left side) including a 99 cents section (left side section, not against the wall). There is a seasonal section in the front of the store (cute stuff). There is a nice selection of Yankee Candles. There are a variety of gifts. There is a Disney section of figurines. There is a gift wrap section on the far right side. There is also a section (back middle of the store) for custom made stationery. The clearance section is located in the back right side of the store. The circular cashier station is in the middle of the store. There's all kinds of candy gifts in the this section around the entire perimeter of the cashier station- kinda like what they do at grocery stores- nice marketing ploy. I prefer this one to the Meadows Mall's store since this one is larger. If you are a crown rewards member, you will earn points on every purchase. You will earn reward certificates periodically based on your purchases, depending on the level (silver, gold). Sometimes you will be given a chance to participate in a survey, (on the receipt) which will earn you a coupon for additional savings for a future visit.
