3	Takeout grilled steak, baked potato, salad.  The concept is hot fresh cooked steak meal that you can take out and serve as a family meal without having to prepare or grill.  Dine in also offered but they're surprised if you take them up on it.
2	Kind of a cool idea if they could pull it off. Unfortunately, they didn't. This review is for delivery only, and I'm not sure i would give them another try for pick up...My order arrived 1 1/2 after I ordered it! And, they wouldn't comp the meal (they did give me some off but still). No one got sick but I didn't want to imagine what my steak was doing for all of that time :-(
4	I was in Mesa for a business trip a month or so ago. Figured id give this a try as a steak sounded delicious but i was without a car to get around. Absolutely loved it, and i had my food both nights within 40 minutes. Will definitely order from here again if I'm back in town.
4	Ordered from here again on a trip to mesa this past week. The wait was a bit longer then last time (about an hour) but still well worth the wait.
4	Somehow I came across this place on the internet. I believe it was a banner add, link or something. They deliver great steaks and grill items to your house. I have ordered the steak both times when I was in a hurry and it was almost like I just pulled it off my grill. They have a special sauce that is decent and allow the steak to finish cooking on it's way to your house in heat bags which seems to work pretty good. I guess they have been around awhile, but I just discovered them and will most likely order from them again.
5	We love ordering from these guys. Unfortunately, they're no longer in business. :(
