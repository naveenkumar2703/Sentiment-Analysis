5	This place is great! I have used them for years- my home, friends' places, rentals, everything and they have never disappointed. They use steam and a solution that is not some crazy chemical dealy so you don't feel like a planet killer. They have always been on time, the guys are cool, they do what you ask for and don't put some hard sell on you for any add ons or undercoating or any of that crap. I had my living room and master bedroom done, had them pre-scrub the high traffic areas and clean the dryer vent and it came to $160 total. Great price and the carpets look awesome! Do yourself a favor and use them!!
1	I called Venturi to see if they would give me a good rate because they have a contract with my apt. complex.  I wanted to pay out of pocket but when i called they gave me the run around, putting me on hold, over and over and switching me to different people and never could get to the right person.  Seemed like different people were pretending to be managers. I was persistent in trying to speak with someone who would help me.Then someone at Venturi called my apt. complex manager and complained about me.I called the CEO to tell him about my experience, never got contacted and then called again, to the local office and spoke with the manager there who was apologetic. Called a second time to the corporate office and asked this time to speak with the regional manager. I got through and told him about my experience. He and the manager were fine to deal with but the team at their office certainly is NOT.I am not sure how such unprofessionalism and lack of customer service keeps them in business at least at the Phoenix location.
