5	They are consistently respectful of your time, and they listen to find out what you want. I've taken my daughter here consistently and the thing I like is I can relax knowing they are going to give my daughter what she wants with no pressure to do what they want. No hidden agenda and no need to stand over them to keep them from being cut happy. (not every one wants a bob cut) one of the few places I trust with my daughters hair.  Have come here several times for my daughters hair and each time they were consistent, with their attention to detail and above all else listening to their customers.
5	Great staff the stylists have all been there along time and are great with color and cuts.
5	Been going here for years. Almost always satisified with the cuts for me and my sons.
1	Wow, very disappointed.  I am new to the area and managed to find the shopping center where they were located, but could not find their shop.  I called and I was definitely bothering the woman who answered.  I asked where they were located and the woman called me "hon" and told me the crossroads.  I told her I was there, but did not see the shop and asked for more details.  She sighed and then told me they were on the NE corner.  Being directionally challenged and new to the area, I had no way to tell which was the NE corner.  I told her that didn't help at all.  No response.  I told her I would figure it out and was still met with silence.  Apparently, she hung up on me after she told me they were on the NE corner.  I took my business elsewhere.
