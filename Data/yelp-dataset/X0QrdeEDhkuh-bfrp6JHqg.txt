4	I nice little sandwich/coffee shop near the river. I was in Edinburgh on business staying at the Malmaison Hotel about a block away.The Clock became a regular stop on my way to work every morning. Friendly StaffGood espressoA small selection of pastries.But the best was the sausage sandwiches with HP sauce.
5	Looking out on to Leith Docks, Clock certainly boasts some great views.   The sandwiches here attract all the nearby  industrial and corporate attention.  After tasting a chorizo, Mexican cheese and salsa roll I was unsurprised at the afore mentioned attention.There's a range of good deli's scattered around Edinburgh, and Clock can be proud to be one of them. The staff are talkative and inviting too. Top stuff.
3	Considering the number of times that I visit The Clock, I don't rate it that highly... am I mad?  Totally, but that doesn't take away from the fact that I can a) park around the corner quite easily and b) always get a quick lunch here that satisfies my basic hungerThe staff are nice & friendly, but the soup is often flavour-less and the baked potatoes are really hit or miss - quite often I've gotten home to find that my tattie is uncooked in the middle. (I'm an old-fashioned, proper oven-baked to within a "skin" of it's life-potato gal).  The wrap & sandwich selection look much better, but I'm not big on bread... perhaps that's where I'm going wrong?! I would still recommend for a quick grab & run lunch in Leith... and the service has pushed up a 2star to a 3star... I'm nice like that!
3	Although a trifle underwhelming, you're not going to go too far wrong at The Clock. Dishes are to a good standard, and the welcome is friendly. Reliable, if unspectacular.Overall, we said: "The Clock is really pretty smart, continues to be very popular, and is a good lunchtime stop. Its offerings didn't unduly quicken my pulse, but they provided good wholesome fare, and, with the warmth of the welcome, set me on my way with a smile upon my face."
