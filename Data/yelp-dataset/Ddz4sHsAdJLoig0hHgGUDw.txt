2	Well first of all this could be a GREAT park. However the DOG owners let their dogs run wild and they think its ok and it's NOT ok. Clean up your dog S$!t.. It's all over the place. Remember children use this park daily they don't need to get dog pee and poop all over them. The signage clearly says ALL dogs must be on a leash. Yes that's right ALL  DOGS even your little peach. This is NOT a DOG PARK.  Animal control should at the park daily between 12-1245pm and 6pm-730pm to start handing out tickets for irresponsible dog owners. Keep your nice dogs on a least and you won't end up with a lawsuit because you think your dog is so friendly. Get this!  I'm at the pool. A woman comes running to the gate and said help me open the gate. I said you can't bring your dogs in the pool area. She said I know but I need help the other dogs are attacking my dogs and I need to get into a safe area. OMG!. She was crying.  I let her in the gate to save her and her dogs. I have seen GREAT dogs do bad things and owners are in jail. Use good judgement be a responsible pet owner.
3	This is a nice park across from my house. It is located in West Park just West of the I-215 and South of W Charleston Blvd.It is a small park that is connected to the community pool and Club House. There is also a small play ground for young children. It is also a nice place to walk around at night or go play catch with the kids during the day.It is really a great spot to view the Red Rock fire works on the 4th of July. The only problem with that is the people coming in to watch that do not live in the community. It causes a massive traffic jam for about an hour or so after the fire works.One more thing that ruins this park for everyone is that some people do not clean up after their dogs. It would also be better if people kept their dogs on leashes. It is a community park not a dog park.
