5	Enjoyed an awesome protein shake after my recent workout! Love this place! Ask for Joe!
5	Wow, I am very inspired after meeting Austin at this shop.  He is super passionate about VivaKids, and every juice/smoothie, food items sold here is to benefit the children at VivaKids Organization.  Yep, the proceeds are used to assist in the feeding and educating the under-privileged children worldwide.  I was so glad that I stopped by for the super juice, which contains natural ingredients for a healthier body and mind.  They have smoothies as well.  There is  room to seat about 6 people in the shop.  Hours are currently M-F, 7am-2pm.  I do hope they will open on the weekends...Money spent on purchasing a beverage/food item goes to an endearing organization, how awesome is that?!?  If you haven't check this place out, you must!
5	I just wish this place was closer to my house!  Honestly, that's how impressed I was.A fortuitous and totally random search for "protein shake" led me to Power Zone after a work out.  I can't compliment this place enough, particularly the incredibly friendly and welcoming individuals working there.  I had just left the gym and had to run an errand on the other side of town so I searched for a place where I could get something after my work out.The shake was delicious and the menu had all of the health information available to review before I made my selection.  I had the Royal Power Zone smoothie which tasted like vanilla.  It was awesome!  The guys working in there, I believe they were the owners, took the time to explain everything that went into the shake and more importantly, couldn't have been nicer.  The shop was incredibly clean as well.  I can honestly say that the only thing I would change is if I could somehow move Power Zone closer to my house.
