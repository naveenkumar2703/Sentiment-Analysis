5	Great honest shop.  I've been coming to SRD for almost 10 years and they always take amazing care of my cars.  In addition, their prices are more than reasonable and the staff is friendly.  If you are looking for a shop for any kind of car or truck you should come by this one.  Plus they also do sandrails now!
5	Chet, Adam and the rest of the crew are honest, hard working and a pleasure to work with. A mechanic you can truly trust!
