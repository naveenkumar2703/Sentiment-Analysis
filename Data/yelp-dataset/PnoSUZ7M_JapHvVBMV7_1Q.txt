5	I've been banking at this location since 2005.  I love the building and the location is very convenient to my work and the south side of Madison.  The tellers have always been very friendly with quick service.  I also have home and business loans through the credit union and couldn't be happier with the service.  The website banking services are also very good, including their android app for google phones!  High Five!
5	UW Credit Union hounded us,  M and I fined us, Anchor sank us and Summit thrilled us.   This should be your bank, ie credit union.
1	I have come to this location four separate times to set up an account. After being sent away for not having made an appointment the second time I should have learned my lesson but I was told most days I wouldn't need one. It's next door to my work but the convenience just isn't worth the attitude of the tellers.
