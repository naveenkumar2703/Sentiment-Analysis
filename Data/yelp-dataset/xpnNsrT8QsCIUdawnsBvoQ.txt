5	I love Family Optometry! I have been going to them for eleven years. I had to take eye therapy lessons because I had trouble with my peripheral vision when I was in grade school. I had glasses for many years and now I have eye contacts. I have Dr. Tsang as my eye doctor. She's awesome, very knowledgeable and helpful. Great staff and cute glasses!
5	I am quite a fan.  I have been going for maybe 13 years with my autistic son.  We have seen Dr. Carr and Dr. Bacon - both are wonderful.  I also have brought my daughters.  Most recently we had an emergency visit because my 7 year old daughter got a scratch on her eye and was in lots of pain.  I was told to bring her right over and Dr. Bacon got her in immediately.  They had no paperwork on her because it had been 6 years since she had an eye exam!  (Only ever did the check at one year old.)  There was no charge for the visit even though I was told on the phone that just the emergency consult would be $75!  How is that for amazing care?!  I highly recommend this office.
5	I've been coming to this office for about 8 years now and the people are very friendly and helpful. I see Dr. Lewis & he always has a funny joke to make the visit fun. Each of the ladies in the office are very accomodating and they all know me on a first-name basis since I've been coming in all these years!I had new lenses put in the glasses I've worn since 2007 and they made the transaction go smoothly with doing this. I will be getting new lenses in my other pair soon as well and am looking forward to this, as my prescription has a slight change to it. I recommend this office to anyone I know looking for a new eye doctor and optometrist facility!
