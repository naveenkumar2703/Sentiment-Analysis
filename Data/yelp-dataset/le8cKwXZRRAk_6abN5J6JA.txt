5	I only have amazing things to say about A+ Auto Repair.  I feel like I always have a car problem and A+ Auto has been able to fix my car quickly and for a reasonable price each and every time.  The owner Chris and his team are beyond helpful with explaining what's wrong with the car, what they fixed, and why the car wasn't working properly.  I trust them 100% with any car repair I need. Five stars for A+ Auto!!!
5	Boo to you Ben!  I love A Plus Auto Repair.  I don't trust anyone else with my vehicle besides Chris and his crew.  I've never had an issue with the cost of repair on my vehicle and they've always finished repairs very quickly.  I recommend A Plus Auto to everyone I know and so far, everyone I've recommended would go back.  Five stars for A Plus Auto!
4	Chris is the owner. Great guy. He has been my mechanic for 2 years.he has always been honest and fair with me. Very good service for a good price.
5	I have been going to A+ for 10 years now and couldn't be happier. Chris and team are honest and the cost has always been fair. Years ago I had a transmission that went bad and needed it replaced. After having my car towed to the shop Chris confirmed the issue and I decided I would sell the car as opposed to having it replaced. In order to avoid paying for yet another tow, Chris offered to keep my car at his shop and show when I had perspective buyers come buy. This is one example of how these guys are willing to go above and beyond... I now live 40 miles away, however still make sure to only use A+ for any major repairs or issues.
5	I stopped by A Plus Auto Repair last week for an oil change. It was my first time there and I was very happy with the service I received. They got me in and out quickly and the cost was reasonable. I would definitely go back for any car repairs.
