4	It's just a normal gas station.They sell Chevron gas which makes me happy.It's on the opposite side of the airport from the strip, but a good place to stop for gas if you just came from breakfast/brunch at the FABULOUS Egg Works and need to make your way back to the freeway.Also, I picked up alcohol here on the cheap.
5	I was filling up regularly at Smiths and after my car started knocking I changed locations to this gas station and after a few fill ups the knocks were all gone. Thanks Chevron with Tecron!  I still fill up elsewhere on occasion but I do my best to stop here. The inside of the store is clean, they recently remodeled the gaming floor with new machines and tile so it looks nice. The employees are always nice and very pleasant and I've seen them on more than one occasion stop everything to help a lost motorist with directions.  Cant say wither or not those people got to where they were going but I can say they all got back into their vehicles with confidence knowing a local Las Vegan took time to take pity on them.
3	What can I say, I stopped to get gas and felt the need to check in while I was there.  It was by far the best get gas when I was almost out experience I had that day!  My credit card was accepted the first time and the pumps worked nicely.  The window washing station was bone dry, but the scrubber was gone so it didn't really matter anyway.I don't make it to that side of town often, but when I do and I'm almost out of gas...I will certainly give this Terrible Herbst another chance to earn more stars!
4	The staff is usually very nice even if they are swamped with people. Bought the 20oz Coca-colas and the clerk told me that they have a promotion for each coke bought get a free wheat thin (zesty salsa or Buffalo wings). I got the Zesty salsa and the clerk said it was one she liked also.
