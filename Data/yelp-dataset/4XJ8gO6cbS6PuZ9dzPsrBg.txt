3	A Taco Bell is a Taco Bell is a Taco Bell. Or is it?  This location is a favorite. It's close by. They are consistent. They are quick. I love me anything volcano. I wish they had the pizza hut with it.
3	I have been here many times, especially with the Dbacks special (6 runs in a game, 3 free tacos with large drink purchase)  this location is also relevantly close to my house (within walking distance) as far as their food goes, I have never had a problem with the food, it always tastes good enough. all of the staff is friendly (most of the time) I have never had any real problem with any of the workers.They are as fast as they should be for a fast food restaurant, never had to wait more than a few minutes to receive my order from the time I arriveone thing about this particular location that does bother me is that there are homeless people (different people on different occasions) that hang out near the dumpster... In my opinion management should do something to run them off or in a recent case of crazed hobo the employee told someone I know to calm down and it's ok if the crazy hobo comes up and talks to their car because he was a "Mentally disturbed" homeless war vet. in my opinion that makes it even worse.A few weird experiences isn't gonna stop me from going here although they may not considering there is a taco bell at cave creek/bell.
4	Can you really go wrong with a bean burrito? I love them here.  They are cheap which makes it even better.  Their hard taco supreme and enchritos are also the bomb.  Obviously I cannot eat here everyday or I'd be the size of a blimp - so this place is for when I am feeling super lazy and do not want to cook - or as a late night, I've been out too long kind of meal.
