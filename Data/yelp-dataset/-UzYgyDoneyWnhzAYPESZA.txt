4	This is little more than just a corner shop, but that shouldn't go against it because it's one of the best corner shops I've seen.At most corner shops you expect to pay high prices and you come in and leave disappointed because you've been priced out of a purchase.  The deals here, however, are outstanding and some of the offers can compete with some of the big chains.It might be little more than just a corner shop, but still a very good place to buy your groceries.
4	There's a lot to do with distance when it comes to liking or disliking a place. The distance between me and this corner shop is a flight of stairs. Which means this is the distance between me and potato scones. Between me and milk for my coffee. Between me and toilet roll. It's really terribly convenient. As far as their products go, they're all reasonably priced. 99p for milk. Around about the same price for potato scones. They used to have shelves and shelves of wine but weren't making any money on it (the Scotmid wineshop being across the road), so they replaced it with shelves and shelves of sweeties! There's something undeniably charming about that. Though their prices are fine, I would definitely not recommend buying coffee or tea there as you could just go across the street and get it for about 50% cheaper. Oh, and they've started making slushies too now! That's kinda cool, right?
4	Great little newsagent which manages to make use of its space very well. lots of interesting items that arent found in every store such as Mrs Unis Nan/pakora, Indian pickles etc.Not the cheapest but the staff are friendly and the place is well laid out.
