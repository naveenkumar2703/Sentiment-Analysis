5	I dont' like to go to banks.I prefer direct deposit and getting cash when I checkout at the grocery or at Circle K or the like.I've had to go inside this location a couple times.  Both times, I was approached by an employee who asked what I needed to do, who then sat me at a "banker's desk", where they took care of my transactions, without standing in line.Nice!
5	I have only gone inside a couple times, but WOW on the customer service!  Chase is the best bank I have ever used, and I've probably had accounts at half a dozen over the years.  Everything is stellar, especially at this location.
5	I love this bank! Great ATM, never any problems. And whenever I have to go inside, the customer service is outstanding. When I started a new direct deposit Melissa from this branch called me to see how my new job was going! Wow!
1	What can I say, I HATE Chase.  They care about no one but themselves.  I only stopped as this is the bank that the account is based from.  Since I have no choice in this matter I use Chase, but for my personal banking, I'll stay as far away from Chase as I can.
4	Great banking location.  Area lighting was a huge plus because you won't fear for your life of being robbed.  It's across the street from Paradise Valley Mall.  Multiple lanes of drive-thru windows and ATM's.
4	Received great assistant from the new manager on-duty, was told that he's the new branch manager or one of them, Michael L.  Needed some money exchange from another branch and couldn't get it and was told to stop here.  Easy and painless process, will definitely recommend this branch if you are in the area.
5	The lollipops they give at the front counter are really good! Ask for the grape flavored one! I think it comes in a violet colored wrapper! If theyre out of grape then choose the strawberry one....very yummy too !!!
