5	Sarai Salon is awesome!!  It is tucked away off Grand Ave in the corner behind a Walgreens and next door to a Bealls Outlet store.  This is possibly the cleanest salon you'll ever step into.  Emma the receptionist, who is also the owner's mother, never stops cleaning and it really shows.  The entire staff is friendly and welcoming.  Lynda Gagliardi has been my hair styist for over 11 years.  She is a true artist and a master with hair color!!!  She can be reached at the salon or at 602-908-1831.  I promise if you are looking for a stylist give her a try you won't be sorry.
5	My stylist recently moved to this salon. It's definitely interesting to see the difference in clientle that visit stores on Grand Ave versus Bell Rd. Let's just say I was the youngest guest in the salon by at least 40 years. BUT--the quality of service was EXCELLENT at Sarai. I was welcomed warmly, offered a beverage while I waited for my stylist and got to observe very kind, professional service all around. The salon is super clean, nicely decorated and has a good number of work stations. The salon was bustling for a Wednesday morning but then again, given that the clientle is mostly retired ladies, it made sense. Although I tend to move when my stylist moves, I'm glad she's found a home here because its quite a nice family-owned place!
5	I second the praise for Lynda.  I moved to AZ from Massachusetts a little over a year ago, and of course -  one of my first priorities was to find a salon that I could call home.  Sarai is not only welcoming, but was responsible for introducing me to Lynda, who is a perfect fit for me.  She's been accommodating, and so wonderful about giving me advice about what to try and what to avoid as things... change (I just hit 50, and your hair gets different!!)  I feel so lucky to have found this spot!!
