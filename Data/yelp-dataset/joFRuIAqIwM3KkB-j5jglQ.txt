3	My gas tank was nearing empty and I had to fill up before I got stranded on the side of the road.  This was the closest gas station, so I pulled in.  The price of gas has really gone up!  $4.09/gal?!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VhttkQtK6wjs1HG_hhTEQg?select=6YXbdYqT4bacjUtw02XHdQIt may be time for me to get a more gas efficient car......dammit!Return Factor - 30%

1	I was a paying customer and had to use the bathroom, live in the neighborhood and am in there all the time.  The owner wouldn't let me use the bathroom! He said I could use the one at sonic, where the other low life's go. Now I drive a 2008 Volkswagen gti, so clearly he knows I'm not a low life.
