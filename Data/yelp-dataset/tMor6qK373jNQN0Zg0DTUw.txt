2	FREE Cookie Slice for my birthday for signing up for the E-Club!:-)A little too much frosting and it was stiff so I assume it had been around a day or two.I prefer Mrs. Fields' myself!
5	We always have to make a stop here when we are in town!  First of all, it's in an outlet mall.  What's not to like about that?  Secondly, they make these cookies that have M&M stuck in the top of them.  They are moist, delicious and most of all very chocolatey!  Love them!  They have a deal, you can get a bakers dozen for a special price.  They have soda, lemonade, milk, brownies, anything if you need a snack or a refreshing beverage.  There's a lovely woman that works there in the afternoons, maybe later, my husband and I didn't get her name but she was telling us that the staff all calls her "Grandma" which I thought was very sweet.  It sounds like she really knows her Thai food, which I love too!  Because of her special service, we stopped on the way out of town and weren't disappointed by the cookies (since we had eaten all the ones we got the first visit!).  LOVE THIS PLACE!!
4	COOKIES!!! Back when I was a carb eating machine, I would eat cookies from here without abandon. I've always preferred the thin, slightly crispy yet soft cookies from Great American Cookies over Mrs. Fields. These are the type of cookies that you get from slice and bake dough like you make at home. If that's you type of treat, then this is the place to go. Some of the frosted cookies can be a bit sweet but I've tried almost every variety this place sells and all of them are good (the snickerdoodles, sugar cookies topped with cinnamon-sugar, being the standout flavor). Swing by the food court if you are in the mall and see if you can snag a free sample. They are usually handing out samples of their chocolate chip cookies. If you are lucky enough to encounter a freshly baked batch of cookies coming out of the oven, buy them! You won't regret it!
