3	In 2005, when smoothie shops begun appearing on every street corner, I sneeringly predicted they'd all be gone by 2006. Four years later, I'm still wiping a bit of the egg off my face, but it must be said they are now slowly but surely disappearing from view, I think for a number of reasons...1. All smoothies taste pretty much the same, regardless of content.2. An actual piece of fruit tastes better.3. People have realised that they were paying through the nose for what is effectively, baby food.That pretty much sums it up.
4	I disagree with the fellow two reviewers, smoothies are here to stay.Think about it, after a late night shouting over music and filling your body with a mammoth amount of intoxicants, the last thing you want down your throat in the morning is anything solid.Sure it tastes the same like Gavin said, but it pretty much covers your 5 a day if you get the right combo.
3	Ever since I was given a shinny new blender, overpriced smoothies have lost their appeal. I can now make several, with just the right combinations and quantities of fruits I like, for the same price as one in Juiced Up.Considering it's a healthy alternative to a coffee when flogging around New Town, Juiced up does offer a good variety of options. However, personally I don't like being bombarded with info about how amazing this smoothie will make me feel, as a lot of times it can just be plain old placebo. Fruit is good for you. Fact. Blend it up and down it all at once kills two birds with one stone. Fact. Make sure there is a toilet accessible afterwards at all times. Fact.
