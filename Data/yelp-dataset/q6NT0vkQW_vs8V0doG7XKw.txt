3	Personally I am not the biggest fan of Subway, but with their $5 foot long sandwich specials, they have me coming through the door more often then not. Other then the $5 specials, their location and generally lack of a line, this is a pretty solid place to go for a decent build it yourself (or more of you tell them to build it) sandwich.
3	The food is what one would expect to receive when heading down to a subway. I am not fond of subway personally, but its close, clean, and the food is the same everytime. You cant beat a $5 dollar footlong either if your on a budget.
4	I like Subway!  They have come quite a ways from when I first started eating at Subways in general.  They now have many bread options from wheat, cheddar and white, flat bread plus some others.  I like the $5 options that you can get here and some footlongs sandwiches are less than $5.  I can eat a 1/2 a foot long for lunch and the rest for dinner!  So great value!Fresh baked bread, toppings and cookies are always good choices.  If you want to skip the bread, you can always get a salad!This location always seems clean and the employees are friendly!  When I've gone here there hasn't been too many people so service has been fast too!
3	Pro of this location is that it's open 24 hrs a day, which for night shift workers is a wonderful option. Another pro is they are usually fast and the restaurant is clean. One of my cons for this location is the lack of personality on the part of the night workers. The two different young men are generally irritated while waiting on me and I think they could use a shower nozzle and soap on themselves. Also on a side note when did subway get so expensive? If it's not a $5 sandwich, you are looking at a 7-8$ middle of the road item to eat. I'll go back because it's close to my employment...
