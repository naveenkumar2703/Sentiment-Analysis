5	This place is fantastic. They have great prices, good service, clean facilities and decent equipment. I bowl here in three leagues and am entirely happy with the experience. I especially like the friendly counter staff who really try hard to welcome you and make your bowling experience the best. Great place!
5	$5 play all you can a very great deal tonight... Start at 930pm to 1230 am... We'll be back here next time
4	My girls bowl in the Junior league here and have a wonderful time learning and improving their bowling skills. The staff are friendly, the amenities are always clean and the prices are easy on the wallet. Birthday parties are a good deal here too, especially if you have a kid with a birthday in the heat of the summer!
1	If you're going here for some fun, then by all means have at it!  If you're considering this place for a league night, run the other way as fast as you can and NEVER look back. I have been on a league at this center now twice, first time was just a fun BS league and this time is a more serious, prize league.  The people that I have bowled with on both leagues have been lots of fun and very down to earth friendly, and the staff, well for the most part are wonderful.  However, there is this bartender that works who is a complete you know what and I'd rather literally walk out of the bowling center and go get another drink before having to deal with this guy; he is not friendly at all, I wish I knew his name, all I know is he works Thursdays.  Anyhow, the lanes themselves- let's talk about this tragedy that is Santa Fe bowling.  On my first league  I had to switch lanes I believe a total of 9 times in a 10 week league, and three times were in one day!  It was absolutely horrible, pins kept getting knocked down by the machine, the machine broke, the ball return didn't work, the computer system froze up- anything you can possibly think of went wrong.  One time myself and three other bowlers literally almost wiped out on the lane because of grease on the lane (one they moved us to after the other two didn't work) and I suppose they forgot to check it to make sure everything was fine.  This was on the fun league, but had it been on the prize league and I threw my ball in the gutter because of that, I would have been furious.  I'm not some psycho angry going to get you if you mess my game boup bowler either (I shudder to think how they'd react) I'm just a normal guy trying to do my best and win that prize fund!  Anyhow, lets flash forward to the new prize league I'm on.  The very first week, on the very first persons turn a pin knocks down.  We reset, it knocks down again, and again, and again, and again. Literally almost 6 or 7 times, finally we call them, they take almost 10 minutes to fix it.  She bowls, then my turn and guess what, it falls again, and again, and again! The people next to us were having the same problem, it repeated for them almost 25 minutes.  Finally the nightmare of an evening had ended.  Now I'm looking at going for my second week of bowling when I get a call from a teammate, "Oh hey the lanes are broken, they said that we would need to reschedule for another night to bowl"  So now, they have screwed up my whole schedule because I have fit things around Thursday night bowling;  I was livid and so were my teammates.  We start playing and guess what happens! You got it, pins are falling over, again and again and again; another twenty minutes there.  Just yesterday we had to make up a day for this Thursday because a couple of us will be out of town, so we start and about 15 minutes in right around the 5th frame first game, guess whaaaaaaaat! Oh yes, again!  I have another 29 weeks of this crap and its REALLY getting old.  After this league is over I will never come back to this place to bowl again until they fix their lanes.  I don't pay 15 bucks a week plus outrageous alcohol prices to deal with this, people have lives and work and we don't have 4+hours for what shouldn't be longer than a 3 hour set.  Santa Fe check yo stuff!
5	Ain't nobody got time for fancy bowling! That is what Summerlin is for. This is not some state of the art bowling facility, this place is for people who's idea of a sport includes drinking alcohol and very little physical exertion. I'm going to review this place for what it is: close to my house. Sometimes pins fall over, balls get stuck and the lanes freeze. Not too frequently, but it's the kind of thing you expect in a casual family joint. The staff is generally friendly, although it is awkward that there is a tip section on the credit card receipt. They aren't very good at managing waits and they like to place people next to each other in lanes instead of staggering, but what are you going to do? It's Vegas, make some friends.Make sure and call ahead or grab a schedule because they have weird seasonal closures that are beyond my understanding and concern, but if you go during the day you will generally get a pretty good deal. Unlike fancy places, the Santa Fe is set up perfectly for a good time in a decent space with people you want to hang out with. Other "fancy" lanes in Vegas are spread out to such an extent that you can't cheer on others in your party. I can only assume this is for the more serious bowling crowd, but the Santa Fe is more of a family place and there is nothing wrong with that. I wouldn't really recommend the bar because it is only sometimes staffed, but you can bring drinks in from the casino and that seems to work fine for most. I'm not all rich and classy, but I prefer to bowl at the Santa Fe for a nice, relaxing time with people I love.
3	If you want to go bowling, this place will do. Not the fanciest of bowling facilities, but it's huge and never too busy where you have to wait for a lane, at least I've never experienced one. When we arrived there was no one at the front counter and I stood there for 5-10 min wondering if anyone would show up. Finally, a guy walked up to the counter and I paid for our games and shoe rentals and although there are numerous lanes, we were placed at lane 9, in between 2 birthday parties with children running around everywhere while the rest of the lanes on the other side remained empty. There were plenty of bowling balls available and the touch screens were easy to use and manipulate. There are also TVs above the lanes so you can watch football or other sports broadcasts while you bowl. There is also a Johnny Rockets and full bar inside which is convenient for drinks/snacks. We went to Johnny Rockets to grab sodas and food and service there was pretty quick even though there were only 2 people working. Didn't go to the bar, but walked by and noticed there was no one there except for the bartender who had his back turned to the counter and was watching football.There's also a small arcade in the back, near the bathrooms, if you have kids. I didn't go in this time around, but have checked it out before. There are a good amount of games in there to keep your kids entertained for a bit if you're non-bowlers or are wanting to kill some time before or after bowling.
5	The overall atmosphere there was nice. We had our daughters birthday party here on the 9th of November. We had a host (Jane) assigned to our party and she made everything perfect. She went out of her to make sure my daughters party was great. Will definitely go there again for another party or a family night out.
2	Decent enough.
4	Nothing tremendous. Just your average bowling alley.  Clean. Staff is friendly enough.  If I could figure out how to get in there without having to go through the Smokey casino, that would be nice.Been to a couple of kids' birthday parties too.  Seems like a good deal, and they take care of a lot of the details, which is nice.
4	The bowling alley at Santa Fe Station isn't as large or nice as other Station Casinos,  but it gets the job done.  I frequent this location the most because it's close to home.  Also, I get these great mailers about once a month that gives me two free bowling games,  so that's another incentive to come in. When we walked up to the front counter there were two employees waiting to help us and no line. Full disclosure: It was a Monday afternoon and the place was dead. We quickly payed for our games and shoes (and used the bowling coupon!). The employee was polite and friendly enough.  She even gave us a lane away from all the other bowlers. I was free to be as obnoxious as I wanted.  Yay!We did have some technical issues- our bowling balls had a difficult time getting out from the grasp of the ball returner. Our lane blacked out too but this was easily remedied by paging the front desk from the bowling screen. Another gripe is that the bar was closed.  I guess bowlers don't drink at 1 in the afternoon? The staff is responsive and the prices are right at Santa Fe Station.  Me and the hubby will be back in the near future!
3	It was alright, nothing terrible. But when I bowl, I try to get in the zone, and prefer being alone or not around that many people. I requested to be towards the end and they instantly said no.. it was pretty upsetting, and I ended up bowling literally next to people that were having a birthday party..... I went to the bar and ordered a drink...and the drink is pretty simple, ended up being really gross and I didn't like it at all. So I wasted a couple bucks here and there. Over all it wasn't that great, but I still managed to have fun. I'll be going back for sure
5	This place is perfect to desensitizing social anxiety disorders. Huge place with lots of lanes so expect to play around a crowd. Judge and be judged! LOL Anyways, I don't have anything much to say that bad about this place - for a town like Vegas we are fortunate enough to have a gazillion bowling centers within our reach but this one is one of the good ones - cosmic bowling for the shy and crazy ones and then league nights galore all week long. Future hotdog place in the works. Esperanto entrance from the casino. Decent size bar; a set of lockers; two clean restrooms, plenty of vending machines, an in house bowling pro shop complete with fitting and drilling services done on site and access to the arcade.
4	*** PROS **** Smart bumpers - go up for kids, down for adults (or those who do & don't need them)* Cosmic bowling on Saturday nights*** CONS **** 2 balls were eaten by the machine. We had to go up to the front desk for help since they didn't respond to the service call we made on the lane/score machine.
