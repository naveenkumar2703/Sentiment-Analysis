4	I started coming here as a recommendation from a jeweler who was retiring and selling his shop. Their prices in appraisals, watch battery changes and general repair are very reasonable.  In addition to new inventory, they also carry estate jewelry too. I have been tempted on a few occasions on some of their pieces but the economy currently restrains me.I'm glad the retiring jeweler gave me such a good recommendation.  I've been going to Dickson's for a few years now, and I trust this jeweler with my few precious pieces.
5	Just left Dicksons about a repair...not only did they fix it they refused payment!!Have several other items that need a bit of love and I'll be back!So cool to find that kind of service anymore. Plus a few folks actually said they were not friendly! Sooo not true...me thinks maybe it was them!!
5	My second time at this friendly, professional shop. My only suggestion is they really should raise their prices......they did several adjustments and tweaks for nothing and the other repairs were excellent and about half what others charge and ALOT less than those mall fix-itplaces and soooo much better!
2	My engagement ring's stone fell off. I never been to this shop and I thought I would give it a try. I specified I don't want them to "glue" the stone back but find a more durable solution. They told me they would call me when it's done. When I was called that the ring is fixed and went to pick it up they realized the ring wasn't fixed!!! They just misplaced it and thought it's fixed. And they really wanted to glue the stone back ... so in the end I was actually happy about their mistake and took it to another jewelry repair store.
