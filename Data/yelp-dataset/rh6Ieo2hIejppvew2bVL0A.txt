4	Always nice to come here for lunch. The sandwiches are of course made super fast and the staff is uniformly friendly.
1	So normally I'm all about Jimmy John's. However, this location wanted "guaranteed gratuity" to deliver outside of their delivery radius. Granted, the address was in a different Jimmy Johns' radius; however, because our location was "so far outside of their delivery radius" (exactly one mile away from their store), the CSR wanted 5 dollars guaranteed gratuity. When I laughed, because I obviously thought he was joking about charging as much as a sub to go one single mile, he said, "well I hope you have a good night" and hung up.Normally, I love the staff of Jimmy John's. After he hung, all I could think was "is this dude for real?!?!". Anyway, not planning on ordering from Jimmy John's ANYTIME in the near future.
5	Freaky Fast! I like about a mile away from this location and from hanging up the phone to answering the door was just 7 minutes! Basically Jimmy Johns is the right choice.
1	Jimmy johns has the worst service, I am a loyal customer who always tips well! I ordered a sandwich with all the freebies, unfortunately they neglected to tell me they were out of tomatoes forgot the Dijon also there were no cucumbers , then when I called to let them know, apparently I wasn't allowed to eat my sandwich after paying my hard earned money and waiting for my food to get the proper order I asked for (still without the tomatoes) and was supposed to wait for the new sandwich, which normally I would be ok with but as this has happened several times and was hungry at this point I was a little irritated how the service person on the phone was short with me, pissed, every time I ask about the owner who obviously doesn't care about their customers considering every time I ask about the owner no one has any idea how to get ahold of them, can't ever help me out!!! I am done with this business!!
