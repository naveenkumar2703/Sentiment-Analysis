4	Sylvia is a great barber and conversationist.
5	I moved from Savannah where I was getting my hair cut at the Barber Pole for many years. I've been wearing a standard men's cut for years. When I came to Vegas 11 months ago I tried several of the "best" barbers in many of the casinos. The very first time I sat down in Neil's chair he knew exactly what I wanted. He is the first ever barber that cuts in the way i say my father and grandfather's barber cut. He just is an artist at what he does. When you walk in and see the pictures of all the celebrities he's done, learn that he's been at The Rivera for 36 years, imagine all he must of seen, see him in the suits he wears it is a lot to take in but it really is not only a great Vegas experience, it's a great experience. Neil has cut my hair more than a dozen times now and not once have I been the least bit disappointed. So if you're in town for that wedding, convention, seminar or business meeting I suggest you get in touch with Neil. Let him give you a proper cut and a great shave. It's more than worth it! Just walk in and meet him. Gage.
5	"Where everyone is treated like a celebrity".Neil and Sylvia are two of the nicest people you will meet in Las Vegas who have been at the Riveria Hotel for a long time.  Go in for a shave and a haircut and "schmooze" for a feel of past and present Las Vegas, you'll be glad you did!
1	Expensive!!! 70$ for a men's haircut is crazy! The haircut looks nice, but nothing special.. The woman cut my boyfriends lip while trimming his beard. Do NOT recommend.
