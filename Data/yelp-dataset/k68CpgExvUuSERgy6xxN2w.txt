3	This place is really well hidden. I would not have even known it was there if I hadn't called PCA SKIN to find out which salons carry their product.This location was at the top of the list I was given and happened to be close to my area.I really was surprised as I walked in, it was really nice inside. The girl at the counter was very helpful and told me they could order in any of the PCA products I needed and just let her know when I was getting low and they would place the order for me. COOL!I'll be returning to get my PCA skin care from now on, and who knows maybe I'll even try out some of their services.I'm only giving 3 stars since I have not had any treatments here, but they do deserve at least 3 for great customer service.
5	Mary Johnson is the skin guru. Hands down the most educated, gentle, caring, skin professional to walk the earth. I was plagued by adult acne late last year. Not only was it embarrassing but it was painful and depressing. Mary did not help me she fixed me. If I could I would have Mary in my pocket at all times. She is an acne exterminator for all ages. I highly recommend Paraiso Skin Care to everyone!
5	BEST, BEST, BEST place for service, skill, price, product (skin care, makeup, jewelery, all kinds of fun stuff), and knowledge- Paraiso Skin Care is the total package. I get microderm most of the time but have gotten peals, makeup, hair, nails... I recommend Mary and her team to everyone!
1	Unfortunately I had a very bad experience.I was looking forward to my appt as I liked Marie J on initial consultation but the facial was really bad . My skin is quite inflamed after combination of microdermabrasion and aggressive extraction.I didn't get any pampering that I thought I would after paying 75$ nor did I get basics like steaming.Towels were uncomfortably hot rather warm.Will never go back.
