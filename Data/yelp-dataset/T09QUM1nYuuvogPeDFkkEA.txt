5	Went here for a massage from Audrey and she has magic and healing hands. I thought I was going for just a relaxing massage, but then she asked if I had any areas that are bothering me and ended up with a therapeutic healing.The office has a friendly staff.The office is clean.
5	Great place, caring doc, helped my neck pain significantly using activator technique and gentle adjusting. The staff are wonderful too!  My neck improved so much that I don't need to go that often anymore, and I'm so happy I found Dr. Greg!
5	A year ago I was having horrible back pain!  Dr Greg quickly put me on a plan to get me feeling better!   Simply amazing.  Dr Greg is awesome and cares about his patients!  I also have had massages from Audrey...oh so great!!!
