1	Slimy owner Kami Eshragi tried to give alder Austin King a run for his money in the elections last year, but turned out to be out or touch with students.  After watching his conduct in the election I will never go here again, but when I did it was a dark place with a very diverse crowd.  Eat dinner on huge matresses surrounded by curtains...kinda shady.  Good dance scene.  1 Star
2	Fun, diverse dance scene, but totally bizarre/creepy decor: ancient Roman brothel meets paleolithic cave.
