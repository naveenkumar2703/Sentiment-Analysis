5	These people love what they do and it shows.  One of the best places in Madison for a create your own deli sandwich - hot and cold.High quality natural and organic meats and cheeses help this deli stand out. And the customer service! These guys are fantastic and totally into what they're doing - making for a fun visit. I love Artamos Deli.
5	Boar's Head meats, organic everything, homemade sides, reasonable prices, huge portions, locally-owned and operated...what's not to love?While I don't buy their meats very often I do go for lunch quite frequently.  Their half-sandwich with two sides special is cheap for what you get.  Great deal.  I'd love to see them expand their deli offerings but that's not to say there's not a large selection now.  Artamos is the closest I've seen in Madison to a NYC deli.  And its WAY WAY better than those gross chain sandwich shops in town.  Don't be fooled by the strip-mall location, this place is worthwhile.
5	awesome.quality meats and cheeses.  local, too!  and the people that work there know their stuff.their make-your-own-sandwiches are delicious and they do NOT skimp you on the amount of meat and cheese they put on them (like some other places ::cough::cousin's::cough::).  you can get hot or cold sandwiches, hot or cold sides .. and all are tasty.i recommend both the potato and mac salad.  if they have mashed potatoes, those are pretty awesome too.don't miss this place.
