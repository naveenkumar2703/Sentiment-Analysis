5	I have been searching for a computer repair place to upgrade my tower PC from Windows XP to Windows 7 and migrate all my Outlook Express files to Outlook.  Apparently this sounds too involved to the 5 or 6 companies I approached only 2 ever even gotten back to me but quoted me open-ended service charges I never went.  Anyway, just when I was desperate to get this done, this new store opened up right next to the UPS Store where I rent a box.  Joe at the UPS Store told me how great Matt & Dave helped him with this laptop so I decided to give them a shot.  Boy am I glad I did!  A "simple" job took from 6/13/14 to 6/24/14 but they kept at it despite how involved it got.  Others would have long given up but they honored their word and their price.  I am now typing this review on this "new" computer.  I am soooooooooooooooooo glad I bumped into them.  Give them a try and you will not regret it.  They fix PCs, laptops, phones, TVs, tablets, etc..
5	Couldn't be more pleased! Friendly employees and great service. My fan to my laptop was making a horrible noise and driving me crazy. I bought a new fan off ebay so my boyfriend could replace but it was too much work. I called them and they said it would take an hour, turned out my 5 year old computer's fan was running poorly because it was so dirty and getting stuck. $80 was so worth my sanity and how fast it was able to be done. Other places were asking $150 for a starting price. Thank you!
5	David over there at My Computer Bytes has the best costumer service and level of professionalism that I have ever experience.  His knowledge is unsurpassed and has been able to easily solve and fix many computer issues of mine.  This is the guy that helped "laptop xchange" get off their feet.  Now he has his own shop and it's 10x better!  I suggest if your computer "bites" (sucks) take it to David for a tune up!
