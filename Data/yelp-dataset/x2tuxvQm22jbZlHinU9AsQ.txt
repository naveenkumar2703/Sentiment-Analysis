2	I felt I had to write a review about this place to ward off potential curious passers by. If you want to spend $900 (SALE PRICE!) for a set of aluminum small tables (no kidding) I will invite you to peruse the selection here. The stuff here is not that nice. Some really old school items that cost about 4 to 5 times what you think they should/could cost. I just can't justify the prices of their goods. Also, when I came in to look around I received no service whatsoever. You can get much prettier and much much more reasonable furniture at Cost Plus, Ikea, Overstock.com and Home Goods.
1	Boy oh Boy I wish I would have looked at the review before going in this afternoon.  What a waste of time.  My sister and I probably passed three sales people and not one greeted us.  Its not like they were busy, the place was empty, seriously other than my sister and I there was one older gentleman.  I guess we didn't look the part.   I was hoping to find some great furniture (gotta an entire house to fill) but no luck, just over priced pieces that look of poor quality.  For the prices they charge I would rather go to Thomasville or Ethan Allan, at least they offer better quality, more variety and they don't ignore customers.
2	Over the past several years we had spent thousands of dollars on numerous pieces of furniture for our home at Robb & Stucky. Always pricy, the most recent item we looked to purchase from them really sent them to new heights. A simple, small, no frills ottoman... for $829.00!!! We balked.. sought prices from other firms (which R&S had indicated they would match)... but when the numbers came back as low as $389.00 for the same item... they refused to honor the commitment. So with little other choice we went somewhere else... and suggest you do the same...(save allot of time and effort).Note: If ya do want to shop at R&S  just better get there sometime soon... they're closing up shop in Vegas, another victim of the poor economy.
