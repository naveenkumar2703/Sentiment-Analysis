4	This store is a high retail store with discount pricing.  You will find things they sell at Macy's or Nordstrom's for almost half the price.  Every Tuesday morning they receive a new shipment, hence the name!  I would recommend checking this place out... Great for gifting, or for things you need around the house.
3	This has got to be the tiniest Tuesday Morning ever! We were cruising Sun City (seriously - looking for our future digs!) and decided to see what they had. Well I can tell you not much. I like the one out in the northwest so much better as it's twice the size of this store. I give it 3* because the merchandise they carry is nice, but it's too small and cramped for my shopping pleasure.
4	What are you looking for?  Linens - check; kitchen gadgets - check, decorative items - check.   Even some furniture items in the back.  If you are decorating, start your search here before you venture to the conventional stores, you may find everything you need and at half price.Staff is friendly and will help you with whatever you are looking for.  They have a great sense of what they have in stock (rare for a store like this).
