5	Where to start... Fabulous Smiles is conveniently located in Mesa, Arizona at the cross streets of Brown Rd. and Greenfield.  The exterior is simply stunning, but the interior is even more beautiful.  The interior offers balanced combination of modern architecture and with beautiful dark colors.  The staff is very reliable and very welcoming. As soon as I entered the rumored, "scary dentist office" and until the very end of my wisdom teeth extraction ( I got all four pulled out at once... It sounds scary, I know, but I promise it wasn't at all), I knew that I was in good hands. No.. this is not a State Farm commercial.  These people actually know how to take good care of you and your smile. Don't take my word for it and head over to Fabulous Smiles yourselves.
5	I would highly recommend Dr. Choi and Fabulous Smiles Dental Care! The staff was great, very friendly and made me feel relaxed. I had a in-depth cleaning of my teeth and gums and not only was it a painless experience, my teeth and gums look and feel a lot better. Dr Choi also took the time to explain to me why healthy gums are important for my overal health. I wouldn't go to any other dentist!
