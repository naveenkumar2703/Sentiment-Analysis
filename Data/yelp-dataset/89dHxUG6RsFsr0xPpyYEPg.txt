4	Had a lovely lunch today!Pizza was very tasty with plenty of topping and made pretty well, pasta didn't have that much chicken and not as much flavor but the help of a little salt and pepper done the trick.Staff could be a little happier behind the counter but overall I will definately be back!Kx
