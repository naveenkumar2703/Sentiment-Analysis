3	Just your typical BK.
3	This location needs a little help. The drive through light was not on. Maybe it was broken but it appeared close at 7pm at night. There was a delay in anyone to take my order which was disappointing because when I pulled through the drive through no customers were placing orders inside or in the drive through. My food was cold including my frozen in the middle apple pie which I did have to drive back to the Resturant to have them fix it. The manager was nice and fixed my order right away.
5	It's so nice to have a fast food veggie burger option!! Please keep it on your menu. It was delicious! I can't say much about the inside of this establishment since I went through the drive thru. The drive thru service was fast!
3	Great people work here and never had bad service here.
1	Oh where can I start... ( you know it's bad when a review starts like that) well first of all drive thru is horrible and disgusting! A lady by the name Sonia was very rude when I brought up that the drive thru was dirty. She said she has to wait for a manager to clean it up! Really?? Why don't you get you go outside and clean it yourself to make your manger proud! Will never go here again and will be sending a letter to the corporate store #16422
