5	Infusionsoft is THE best software for automating a small/medium business with the type of features and capabilities that were previously only available to the Fortune 500.  In addition,  there are dozens of great 3rd party apps that bolt on to extend the functionality even further.
5	Excellent software and company.  It's always a pleasure to be in their building and I love how everyone there seems to love their job.  I've been using Infusionsoft for our company, Loud Rumor, for 7 months now and couldn't be happier.  If you own a small business... This is a great addition to your marketing and operations systems.
1	Small business owners need to be warned about infusionsoft. Their sales people will lure you in with grand promises about what their software can do. Check the internet, there are many stories about small business owners purchasing their software based on false pretenses. Once you find out the truth, you've already spent thousands of dollars, and infusionsoft, to my knowledge has never issued a refund. Rather than help small businesses like they claim, our experience was that infusionsoft actually preys on small business owners. The bottom line is their software can't do what the salesman repeatedly assured us it could do. Had we known the truth about this, we never would have purchased the product. This company also has very bad customer service. They are always right in their own eyes, the are rude and aggressive. They are so big they literally don't care about the "little guy" small business owner. This is one of the worst companies I've ever dealt with, horrible customer service.
5	I just attended #icon14, what an amazing company!  I love our Infusoinsoft apps and am impressed with the companies ability cast its vision to its own organization and its entire customer base who have become infusionsoft vision casters as well.  Great company to work with.
1	Many of you may be wondering if you can trust infusionsoft...well in short no you cannot. Here is the reason why... So I'm a sole-proprietor of a business in which I was looking for something to handle all or the majority of the online aspect to my business. I came across infusionsoft which seems a little pricey ($200per month) but I thought hey at least everything will be in one place...I contacted infusionsoft to ask some questions and they were happy to give me some answer (misleading answers)...I didn't really get a demo run for myself to play with the interface before purchasing but i explained how my business is a mobile business and I need to be able to handle everything on the go. The sales rep explained that I wouldn't have a problem handling things on the go and how much infusionsoft will help my business grow and so on. I talked to him for a bit and thought it might be worth going with that and decided to go for it...the rep then tells me that there's a $2000 dollar start up cost which then set me off balance...I told him $2000 is very steep and not in my budget and he then tells me to hold on a second and comes back to say "I've got great news were having a promotion where we can break up the payment in small amounts which we will just add to the monthly"...I the say "okay so then your going to break it up and I basically pay until it's paid of or if I decide to cancel" he the says yes that's correct and that was that...I thought awesome the price isn't that much a difference now so let's get started using the awesome tool (or so I thought)...so after signing up this start up cost included like 3 online meeting to show me one on one how to use the system a little bit just to get comfortable. I spend time importing contacts from my previous crm online and adding tags and connections manually and finally once I was done I could go ahead to use the system on the go and start to notice that I was scammed into thinking there was a mobile friendly system which there is not! I then email that I will be cutting my loses short and canceling my account. I receive an email I cannot cancel be email and that I will need to call in...so I call in and they say okay well before they can cancel someone will be calling me to understand my reason for canceling...I tell the rep why and I'm told the lady who will call me still will want to call me herself...at this point I'm confused and frustrated how I cannot cancel unless speaking to a specific person!...later I finally get a call back from "****" and she then asks me why I cancelled and explained that they are not mobile friendly and she says they are and they have a new app which I can see all my contacts on...I check out the app and I cannot edit contact info and I can only view a contact...in my business I need to send invoices on the go, be able to create new contacts on the go from clients calling my cell phone...I cannot do anything be see EXISTING contacts...I then tell her that's not being mobile friendly as there is no functionality...how is that even close to what I can do on a desktop?!...I tell her listen when you guys get something functional give me a call back thought right now I want to cancel...she then says she's do so and we part from there... Later on I start to find out I'm getting emails from them saying i owe them $1'200 dollars...at this point I'm tired of them and totally ignore them and as a bit of time goes by we now arrive to the present where they are threading to send my account to collections dispite the agreement we had at the beginning or our sour relationship! I've explained to them the situation and ***** there account collection rep tells me to contact "****" as he says she can help me so I do, **** then tells me there's nothing she can do and how she told me during our last convo about my "responsibility" accourd ing to her in paying the bill...I told her how we never spoke about anything but how they are not mobile friendly...she says for me to speak to ***** and that he can help me...I explain to her ***** told me to talk to her and I have yet to receive a response from her now. it seems I'm now going to be tossed around abit! HANDS DOWN IN MY TOP 5 WORST CUSTOMER CARE EXPERIENCES!
1	Quit Calling Me!!! Holy crap I signed up online to get more info, someone called me within 2 min and I talked to them for 20min, decided it was not right for my business. Since then I get called everyday, sometimes 2x a day. Asked to get taken off there call list but I hasn't stopped!!
5	If you are an entrepreneur and you love small business, you will love Infusionsoft. As one of their original clients, I can say the passion for small business success at this company is unmatched. When I first met the founders in the very early days, they were creating basic databases. They have turned their love for relationship marketing, problem-solving and helping entrepreneurs into one of the fastest-growing and most successful companies in the industry. If you are looking for a CRM with lots of power and features, this one is for you. Some people have and will make negative posts about this sales and marketing CRM platform. Infusionsoft is a bit complicated, and in order to be that powerful -- and if you want to be successful -- you must invest the time and money to attain the success they have assisted thousands of companies reach. They provide top-notch training and small biz conferences like #ICON to get your sales machine off the ground. I give Infusionsoft five stars.
