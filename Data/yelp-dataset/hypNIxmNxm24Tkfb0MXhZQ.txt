5	If you seek the right items and tremendous selection in top-quality men's clothing, you've got to stop by this place!I was visiting from Denver and came across the Clotherie through an internet search.  What a great surprise!Greg and Tom were terrific and deliver exactly what I would expect from a fine garment retailer.  Excellent ideas, good listeners, and easy to speak with.  Oh...and they just happen to have an excellent selection of Nat Nast, Zimberg, Robert Graham, etc.I will definitely return here the next time I am in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area!Great job guys!
5	They are in the great service business. The clothes are great, but the reason they have been around for ever is they know how to take care of the customer. They never give you the " sorry we can't do that" they just do it and with total professionalism. Highly recommend!!
4	This store mostly caters to the older gentleman, but a young guy with a more sophisticated style can find a few pieces here.  Their suit selection is great and I think the only place in town that carries Z-Zegna (Zegna's more youthful line).  Their dress shirt selection is also fun; they carry a ton of fun Eton shirts.  The best part is their knit tie selection.   The service here is great.  I work for a competitor but I still occasionally buy from here (shh, don't tell anyone).  Overall, a great haberdashery with a good selection of men's clothing; simply one of the best in Phoenix.
