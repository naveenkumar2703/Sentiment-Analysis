5	Very clean, safe and professional. They have friendly staff. Great management. They take kids nutrition and security serious.
5	We go and teach computer class at A Step Ahead Preschool.  Teachers are very friendly and very caring to the students there.  The owner Ms. Maysa is very professional and I have a lot of respect for her.  I can see that the students there are trained very well and got prepared for kindergarten.  It was very surprise to me when I first came to the school and see how inside looks like which is very different from the outside.  Inside the school was and is very clean and neat.  Very organized in deed.  I would recommend her school to families.
5	I visited this preschool for my niece and it looked clean and nice and the staff were educated and caring. I really recommend this preschool for your kids. The atmosphere was fun and energeticI also liked it because it is a family oriented and operated so they own run then business with their own kids in it.
