5	ADORABLE PLACE!Wraps, Pastas, Salads, Pizza, Gelato, Pastries, Sodas and SuchSuper darling place that makes you feel so comfortable.  Looks like they have computers to use (i don't know if there is a charge). The inside is precious, decorated to the T-- not a single spot was missed.  Our food was placed on a silver tray and handed over to us to sit in a comfy booth and enjoy our wraps and pizza.  It was really good.  The place is just so darn adorable; it's hard to concentrate on the food when everything was so POSH while you NOSH.  Get it?

Although I wonder how it would do if it weren't for the fact that it's in downtown Mesa, so there is NO competition. At all. Unless you count the Taco Bell, the Subway or the Quiznos. Or that weird gas-station looking Mexican place...Posh Nosh's pasties and pizzas are tasty, but overpriced. Their coffee is so-so. Their salads are waayyy too tiny for the price. However, things might be looking up -- the last time I was there I had the caprese salad, and it was really good.The desserts look really nice, but I've never had them. So, I guess, when push comes to shove, I have mixed feelings about Posh Nosh.Edited to let ya'll know: I had their gelato last week. Pistachio. AMAZING! Best gelato I've had.
