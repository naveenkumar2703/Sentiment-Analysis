1	Worst service I've ever had. Waited for 20 minutes while the only guy working stared at me and wouldnt help me with my questions. Highly unprofessional, he didn't even address my presence or greet me. My advice, go to the pearle vision downstairs I had way better luck with them
3	I was window shopping at Fiesta Mall yesterday when I spotted the LensCrafters. I went in just to  check what they had to offer and was greeted and helped immediately, so maybe they took the other reviewer's criticism to heart. Both clerks who helped me were very pleasant and informative. The store was having a 40% off sale and could get my glasses in an hour PROBABLY, barring unforseen glitches. It was evening so the Dr. wasn't in. Frames started at $99, the lenses would be about $190, exam about $85, so my total about $350-400 for one pair minimum. I took their card and continued my window shopping. I do need new glasses and thought it might be worth it to pay more and have them right away.
5	My husband's glasses fell apart while he was shopping for glasses at a nearby VisionWorks, whose staff was completely rude and unhelpful, told us we'd have no chance of getting glasses there or anywhere that day.  I googled from the waiting room of VisionWorks while he was finishing his eye exam, called Lenscrafters, who had his lenses in stock, we went over, bam, one hour later, he's got new glasses.  They didn't take our insurance, but they managed to get us a deal that we were happy with, with frames he liked.  Yay for Lenscrafters!
4	I came looking for a particular pair of Coach glasses that weren't at the San Tan Mall location. They quickly helped me locate the pair, looked up my prescription from another store and handled my insurance. Within two hours I walked out with a new pair of Tiffany & Co. glasses that I love. Sales people aren't pushy. Just limited options, so if you don't want a pricey designer pair go elsewhere.
