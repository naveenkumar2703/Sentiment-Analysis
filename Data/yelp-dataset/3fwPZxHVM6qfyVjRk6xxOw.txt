2	It's convenient for me to swing in here in the mornings when my hubby leaves the gas light on for me :-/ It never fails that it's always a morning when I am pressed for time, thankfully there is usually not a line or if there is a line it moves quickly. The gas here usually isn't the cheapest but for me it's the most convenient. (At least for me in the mornings it is) I never purchase anything from inside because things here also seem to be on the more expensive side and they don't have a great selection of anything, so I stick to the 7-11 across the street (No gas there).Honestly, this place would be super duper if it were an Arco AM/PM, or maybe a Terrible Herbst, or anything different for that matter. I do like that this gas station is located right next my morning Starbucks, so at least when I do start of with the crappy chore of having to get gas in the morning I know my coffee is close at hand.
3	I fill up here regularly because it's right down the street from my house and their pricing is usually lower than other nearby gas stations like Shell. Best time to drop by is during the day because everyone is always filling up on the way to work in the mornings or after work in the evenings and it does get crowded here. Their pumps work great and I've never had a problem with using my card or getting a receipt. They accept most fleet cards as well which is sometimes a concern for these smaller stations.
3	The inside is always empty the pumps are always full. The staff are ok for the few moments in time that you stand before them and pay for snacks & gas. I give it 3 stars. I come here often.
4	Great all needs stop. Gas Seems to be cheaper here.
