4	Borders has almost everything, and if they don't have what you want, they'll get it for you. The staff are nice and patient and once managed to find what I wanted from a Christian name and a vague description. Their DVD section is a bit over priced but they have a damn good sale. It's worth popping back in regularly during their clearance as eventually the DVD's go as low as a pound. The coffee shop is nice and the children's section has a lovely carpet. They hold regular events and donate to local causes. It's magazine selection is fab and I think that they are the only people in Edinburgh who stock certain titles.
