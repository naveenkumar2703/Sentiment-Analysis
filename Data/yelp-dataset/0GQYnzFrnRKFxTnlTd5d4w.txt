5	Working with Rosemary is super easy. I came in with a very modest budget for flowers ($200) and we were able to work with it. Bridal bouquets, bridesmaids, and boutanneires. she's a pro, and I would highly recommend. Also! They are open late, which is AWESOME for people like me who work in Scottsdale and live downtown. Thanks guys! I'll report back again with photos once I get hitched ;)
5	Checked reviews on Yelp for Florists near St. Joe's Hospital. Flowers by Joe Gregory sounded great. Well, not only are they great, but they go above and beyond good service. When ordering the flowers, Joe indicated that the type of flowers I requested were not that fresh, but he described what he could create with the freshest flowers in his shop for the same price. Placed the order for a friend who had said they were going to have surgery at St. Joe's. About 30 minutes later got a call from Joe: there was no patient at St. Joe's or 2 other hospitals near by that he had called. I checked and found out I had been given the wrong information, she was at St. Luke's Hospital and still in surgery (so no room # yet). Joe thanked me and said he would call St. Luke's hospital later and get her room # and then deliver the flowers. Assured me the flowers would be delivered today once she was in her room, even if that meant making the delivery at the end of his day. You can't ask for better service than that! Will call on Joe Gregory the next time I need flowers! Thank you, Joe!
5	I wish I could post a picture of the strikingly beautiful arrangement Joe Gregory created for my uncle's funeral.  Flowers by Joe Gregory masterfully created a large funeral spray and incorporated a golf club since my uncle was quite the golfer.  The spray was truly unique and everyone in the church wanted to know where it came from.  Thanks Joe!
1	I read some positive reviews so I thought if try this place. Arrived at 4:30 to find them closed. Although posted hours are 9-5. Less than stellar first impression.
