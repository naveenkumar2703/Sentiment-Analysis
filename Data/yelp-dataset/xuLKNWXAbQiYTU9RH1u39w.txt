1	I hate giving a 1 star but I have to. I was shopping and needed a little treat for me and my toddler..so I thought a cinnamon pretzel would be perfect. I should have known when I saw the girl DUNK the whole pretzel in the butter it was gonna be bad.Then she covered it in a half inch layer of cinni-sugar.When we sat down I had to scrape off ALL the topping and what I was left with was a horrible artery clogging nightmare.I tried a bite and was not pleased. I had to let the little guy try a piece cuz he was very aware of the "treat". He actually spit it out.He never does that..he eats everything..even sushi!I should have went back for a refund but had to get the boy something stat before he flipped out. So we went to Nestle for a cookie...
4	I love the cinnamon pretzels never had a bad experience at this place. I happen to like the extra amount of butter and cinnamon they put on the pretzels.
4	Whenever I go shopping in this location I always grab a pretzel dog. Try to sign up online for their pretzel perks to get lots of coupons and free pretzel!
