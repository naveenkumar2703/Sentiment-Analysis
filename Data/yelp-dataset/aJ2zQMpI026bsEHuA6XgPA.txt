5	Yes, yes.  They have wonderful sandwiches, soups and specials.  The wine is priced right and the place is clean, and comfy with a great staff.  A great place to go for a quiet glass of wine by yourself-you won't regret it.  Or, take a group of friends, you will be treated right.  Order a case of your favorite wine on your way out, better prices than Bev Mo!
4	Small plate heaven. We had crabcakes and seared scallops. Both were delicious. The cheese boards are excellent. Plus, the wine by the glass selections are wide ranging and well chosen. I had a white Priorat for the first time, and a Corsican red. Both were delightful. Good service and ambiance as well. Definitely worth a visit for foodies and wine lovers.
