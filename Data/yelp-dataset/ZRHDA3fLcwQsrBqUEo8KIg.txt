3	We've been driving by New Day Cafe every once in awhile and it doesn't hurt when you see ads for them in the newspaper too.  We finally got around to brunch here on a Saturday and it was nice to see this neighborhood cafe more than half filled with customers this afternoon.Their menu is extensive with a wide range from breakfast items to sandwiches, salads, burgers, and wraps.  They also offer a kids' menu for 12 and under.The BF went for the "Cactus Jack Omelet, made with nopalitos, chorizo, salsa, and monterrey jack cheese" for $8.29.  It also came with hash browns or home potatoes.  It was a decent size order, but he thought it would be bigger.I went for one of their breakfast wraps, "Chorizo, eggs, green chiles, potatoes, and cheese, made with two scrambled eggs in a flour tortilla and served with sliced tomatoes or cottage cheese for $6.99.  With a little hot sauce, it's your breakfast burrito.  It needed a bit more green action inside though.Overall, our breakfast items were okay.  They satisfied our breakfast cravings, and it was nice to try out a new neighborhood restaurant.  Service was okay, they could learn to work better as a team instead.  (We noticed other orders sitting in the window ready to be brought out to the customers, but the other waitresses didn't help with those.)  They do offer some cool jams and jellies for your bread, like apple jelly and peach jam.  (Pics of our brunch are in the business profile!)
4	We have eaten here 3 times and enjoyed the food all 3 times.  I have had breakfast twice and a burger once and was satisfied with my choices.  Very clean inside and a comfortable atmosphere.  I like that is it not a typical chain cafe and it is close to our house to that is a plus!
3	starting to make the rounds in my new neighborhood - today, breakfast at the New Day .   Meat omelet, coffee = $11 - pretty standard stuff, nothing out of the ordinary.  The thing is, while eating the omelet i start to realize.....there's little to no taste ! it's supposed to have bacon, ham and sausage and i see some sort of meat in there - but no taste  !! reminds me of the beer commercial where it's raining outside and guys are running around slurping up the rain yelling, " it's raining beer, it's raining beer ! "other then that,  nothing else to report , ho-hum
3	The wife and I were looking to go somewhere new for breakfast... We had driven by this place so many times and never went in... Today, it was exactly what we needed. http://www.newdaycafelv.com/Cozy place that is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside. It has a nice decor with "Bar" style seating in the far back. Very clean. Also, it is refreshing to go somewhere that isn't a chain.The staff was busy but were quick and friendly. We had our meals within ten minutes  of ordering...The menu was large and had just about anything you would want for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I had the Ham and Cheese Omelet with Hash Browns and wifey had the South Western Omelet with Country Potatoes. They also had Seattle's Best Coffee (nice touch). Everything was good! We both really enjoyed our meals and it definitely wasn't overpriced. The New Day is nothing out of the ordinary, but we weren't really looking for anything out of the ordinary =)This is a real nice little Ma and Pa kinda place good for that "Late Sunday Breakfast"Cheers!
3	Breakfast is served here at all times but they do close at 8pm during the wk & 3pm on the weekend.  The menu is simple easy whereas the food is fresh & no frills.  I had a basic reuben & my tablemate had the egg white omelet with cheddar cheese & ham.  Everything was efficient & quick but less stars due to more pricey (value) than other places.
3	Went bk 4 more trying ABC burger, veggie wrap, fajita wrap, & french toast.  All was acceptable but as others have remarked-- on plain side.  Still seems wholesome though & not owned by a corp or chain.  Now they close @3pm everyday.
3	We have been here twice and have enjoyed both visits. The staff is very friendly, the prices are reasonable, and the menu offers a number of choices.Other reviews have mentioned that the food is bland but I did not find that to be so. Maybe that is because I am not looking for a twist to my club sandwich. I think it is good, solid fare.This is definitely a nice neighborhood restaurant - I just wish that I did not live on the other side of town. We will certainly return for another visit and I will venture off the sandwich menu to see what else they have to offer.
5	This is a throw-back to a neighborhood cafe.  Service was excellent, food and portions were excellent as well.  A family atmosphere, friendly and good old home-style cooking make this a must for locals.
3	Pluses: -service-priceMinuses:-water has strange tasteThat's not an amazing place but enough good to stop over there.
4	Just had lunch there today with the roommate.We were seated immediatley, the waitress was a trainee, but she did a great job, and the food came out pretty quickly.I had the French Toast Club...Turkey, ham, swiss, and fried egg, served club sandwich style with French Toast in place of regular toast...my only complaint about the dish was that it needs bacon (then again everything is better with bacon). But it was one of the best breakfast things I have had in a while.The restaurant is small, they were kind of busy, but the kitchen did a great job getting the food out.Bonus, you can get a coupon on Restaurant.com for $10 off a $20 purchase, which really takes a big chunk off the bill!!!I will be going back (plus it's fairly close to where I live)
3	Twas a windy terrible day, and therefore I had to get my car fixed. The check engine light was on and I was maybe 7,000 miles over my 3,000 mile checkup.  That's why I took off a star.So we decided to head up New Day Inn. We were seated immediately. Had a coffee that tasted black. I'm not racist, but I had to add cream. That's why I took off a star. Had a Cactus Jack omelet. I had to research popolitos (cactus) before committing to that. I was not wowed. It was good and not bad. That's why I took off a star. I don't know if I cared much for the conversation and that's why I'm taking off the star. Geez, dad!The atmosphere was nice and open (aka homey and devoid of customers). The food had potential for so much (bland). The waitress was good (not as hot as the food). So that's why I took off the star. It was a good eating and I was relatively happy, but that's why I took off the star.
3	Stopped in last weekend, a buy one, get one coupon brought me in. I had the western omelet with hashbrowns. Straight-forward, but nicely prepared. Appreciated the cheese being on the inside of the omelet, and the hashbrowns were of the shredded variety. Often, I'll get breakfast potatoes when hashbrowns are noted. They weren't greasy, either which was another plus. My sister had a wrap that she enjoyed. And my three year old nephew liked his chicken tenders, and fishy coloring mat. Service was friendly and prices were reasonable. It's nice to have another breakfast option close to home.
3	My friend had gotten a coupon off of Restaurant.Com and it is near the expiration date so we decided to come here for lunch last Saturday.I wanted to eat healthy, so I chose an entree from the healthy section-scrambled eggs with salmon bagel:  The scrambled eggs had cooked diced salmon.  I placed this kinda dry combination on top of half of my bagel with cream cheese.  That is when I realized....Gee, I really like bagel and smoked salmon (bagel and lox..yum), but when the salmon isn't smoked and is cooked, it is not so great...Note to self...Never ever have cooked salmon on cream cheese :(My friend got the healthy turkey omelet  (hey, we are about to attend hot yoga...gotta eat healthy).  She said it was ok, nothing stood out.We also ordered each a hot chai.  They used the powder to make this tea, and I will stick to my Oregon Chai with Soy Milk.  The H2O did tasted funny, but lucky me, I always bring my own bottle of water.The waitress was a bit odd.  She seem kinda out of it.  Don't know...My friend actually bought 2 of the coupon and had asked if we should go back there the next day to use up the coupon.  I normally would say ok, but I had to back out of this one.  I know I know...I should give it 2 more shots...maybe in a few months, but the next day was wayyyy too soon for me.I will try this place again, but in the mean time, I shall eat breakfast/brunch elsewhere.
3	I always drove by this place but they caught my eye with their Mobile Advertising Beetle (orange and yellow) fully wrapped in Vinyl parked in their lot. I thought it was cool! It was a breakfast joint that I had to try! Place was quite cozy and staff were corteous and bubbly. The menu offered typical American breakfast and lunch dishes you would find at any other diner type establishment. The goods: Eggs Benedict with hash browns: it looked like a normal eggs benedict, nothing special but I did like how they weren't skimpy with the hollandaise sauce. What I think the most important part of this dish is in fact the hollandaise sauce. Theirs wasn't all that great, not that flavorful, I would of liked it a tad thicker in consistency as well. The eggs poached perfectly, ham was decent and muffins were fine. Their hashbrowns were average and was a nice filler to the plate. Not a bad choice..Western Omelet: good portion, stuffed with bacon, green bell pepper, onion, tomato and mixed cheese. Also opted for the home fries and white toast. The omelet was straight forward, nothing special but satisfying. The home fries were great, they are seasoned well and come like chunky pieces of potato. An o.k. omelet and great potatoes.Belgian Waffle: plain, just powdered sugar on top with syrup and butter on the side. Almost every bite was either hard or almost mushy, wasn't cooked evenly but the few inches that was properly pressed was pretty darn good! This should of been at least a 4 star waffle but instead 2 stars should suffice. Service was good but food just decent
3	Oh, how I could use a half! Star, that is.  3 1/2 is really where I'm leaning for this place.The food is standard. Good and cheap, my two favorite things in a restaurant! The staff is friendly and attentive, which is also key.You can get all the regular diner stuff. It's basic, it's good and it's served with a smile.  Sometimes that's all you need or want.
4	EXCELLENT service, GREAT food, a great family restaurant! Their french toast was great, but what was nice was that there was something for everyone in our family.  Half of us wanted breakfast and the other half wanted lunch, it was great!! We will definitely be frequenting the New Day Cafe!!
4	Great breakfast!!  They have a variety of breakfast selections.  Staff was very friendly and they all seemed to work together instead of having one server assigned to a table..being that it's such a small place, it's probably a good idea.  We'd definitely come back here again.
4	I've been here about five times since it has opened and they serve up a mean eggs benedict. It's located near my house so it's convenient since I do not have to drive far. I have yet to try anything else on their menu, but the eggs benedict keeps me coming back for more =].
2	I'm sorry to say that we just weren't impressed.  My biggest issue is that my daughter and I both ordered salads and they lettuce was super wet.  They need to invest in a salad spinner or something.  Food was just okay.I'm sorry.  I wanted to like this place, but I'm just not feeling it.
3	I have been wanting to go to their Silverado Ranch location, but because Katrina M. has a groupon for this location we stopped by for brunch before she had to work.When we entered, the restaurant was steady but not busy. We sat down at the booth the waitress just cleaned off and were greeted with menus. Wanting to avoid any hassles we showed the coupon and got that out of the way. From that point on, it did not feel like we were top priority, but we were not ignored completely either. Katrina M. was in the mood for waffles and turned it into a combo with eggs and sausage for a dollar more. The waffle was ok, a little soft for my taste. I have been craving a patty melt with grilled mushrooms, so I jumped on that. I also chose a bowl of chicken tortilla soup for my side. The soup was light. The patty melt was cooked to a perfect medium rare and juicy. Maybe it was a little too juicy because my rye bread was soggy. I love that they do not fry the sandwich in a ton of oil to make it crispy, but the second half of my sandwich had sopped up all the meat juices before I could get to it. The experience was not bad, just not something I would drive across town for.
3	Definitely a place to stop in from time to time. Came here a few times a couple years ago when they first opened but they started changing the business hours so it was never open when I stopped in.Decided to try it out again today with a friend and we had a blast. The food was delicious (just as I recalled) and the service was spot on, the place wasn't busy, but I was still surprised to find my glass was never less then halfway before a refill was being poured.Its a bit smaller then a a winged section at Dennys but the floor plan is similar, tables through the center and booths on either side. As of this writing their hours are 6AM-3PM with a few 'early bird specials' from 6-9 (which my friend said he'll be coming back for).
2	Went here with a Groupon the other day, which is probably only way I would go back. Nothing was terrible at this place, but nothing was great either. I had the TBA melt and my wife had the Tuna Manhattan. For "melts" both severely lacked some cheese. Neither of us were thrilled with what we got, but both finished them if that says much. Then for the kids I split a burger between them, (wasn't going to do more than that since they charge $5.49 for this.) Burger was flat and eh when i tried it. Then for Fries it looked like we got the crumbs at the bottom of the bag for the most part, with only a few good fries. I'd be happier with a 6 dollar burger combo at Carl's Jr over this one. Service was fine, they took our order, brought our food then our check. Nothing more, which is fine with me.
3	It was a yummy lunch.....WE had the Tuna Manhatten and it was very good. Nice portion size and a reasonable value.
2	**Summary**       - Prices - Their prices are pretty steep for the amount and quality you get. Their New Day Combo has 2 bacon strips, 2 eggs, and a tasteless french toast for $7.99. Other places you can get that plus hash browns for $5.       - Taste - The only redeemable thing about the entire meal was that the breakfast sandwich itself was pretty good. This is the first breakfast place I've seen that screwed up seasoned potatoes.       - Lag - It was decently packed when we got in and didn't get out food for about 40 minutes.       - Service - The waitress came over three times during my entire visit there. Once to take orders, another to return with the food, and lastly to drop off the check. I didn't expect much service, but that's just ridiculous. I didn't even get a refill on my drink.**Ordered**       - $7.99 Breakfast Sandwich - Bagel sandwich was pretty good, but the seasoned potatoes weren't seasoned well and undercooked (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ea04rGA3H-ZqY1nHLpI2FQ?select=Sp5Q6ZCE92FTaTcT47WCKg).       - $7.99 New Day Combo - You get very little for what they call their signature combo. The french toast was lacking flavor and was simply sub par (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ea04rGA3H-ZqY1nHLpI2FQ?select=lRBRvqm2oKC8fwYMaEBPaQ).**Recommendations**       - I would definitely not recommend this place. Your local IHOP would have better food and at lower prices. I would of given this place a one star had it not been for the bagel sandwich.
3	Good breakfast/brunch here. When bar food isn't cutting it anymore this and Cracked Egg are my spots to grab real breakfast. The prices are pretty steep here for the amount of food you get so 3 stars instead of 4.
1	Serious 30 min... Still wasn't seated... They seated 5 groups of  2-3  people and we were still waiting... We decided to leave and go to Beach Cafe... So much better... The waitress is nice and so the waitress was amazing... So glad we ate here instead of this place and there was no wait for a group of 5
4	My husband and I go to this place at least once a week for breakfast and occasionally we make it there for lunch. Food: The food is pretty good. We usually get an omelet or eggs and bacon. We don't eat carbs so we do fruit with our meals. They have a lot of healthy options and we like that. They never have a problem tailoring something to fit our needs. The staff is very accommodating. The food is cooked well and never greasy. The fruit is fresh and the coffee is good. Staff: We go here mostly because of Stephanie! She is an amazing waitress, always remember what we order and is friendly and fast! The hostess and some of the other waitstaff are also very nice. The cooks are great when we see them and always make things exactly as we want them. There is one waitress who isn't very nice and we avoid her but it's like that everywhere. Cleanliness: This place is always clean and bright. Dishes and silverware are clean as are the tables and seats. Bathrooms are immaculate. Price: it's not that cheap but it's not overly expensive either. If you're looking for a 5 dollar greasy plate, this isn't your place. They use high quality ingredients and fresh fruit and veggies though so I'm willing to pay a little more for that! Highly recommended!
1	THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION FOR NO STAR BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY WOULD GET!!!  I had a groupon, other than that I would never have gone in, even though it is close to where I live and I pass it all the time.  Even with 1/2 off, prices are still high.  Go to Egg Works Rainbow/Badura, instead.  Where do I begin.  We went in the a.m., ordered breakfast.  Not a lot of people.  About 4 other tables.  Placed our order, waited for food.  In walks in a man, by himself.  Has his order taken, immediately gets on his cell phone talking english/spanish.  He is loud, rude and obnoxious.  Doesn't put down the cell, until his food comes so he can stuff it shut.  Other than that, he would still be on the cell.  We are trying to eat and conversate ourselves, however, not when rude a$$hole won't shut up.  We are waiting for the waitress or owner, somebody, to tell him to keep it down or turn it off.  Nothing at all.  We pack our food to go.  We pay and we ask to speak to the owner.  Were told they are at their other location on Maryland.  Asked for their phone number.  Asked the waitress if the a$$hole was a regular or family member/owners friend, as to why she didn't bother to ask the guy to tone it down, or turn it off.  She replied, "If you would have said something, then I would have.  Livid isn't even close to what we were feeling at that time.   THIS IS AMERICA, SINCE WHEN DID IT COME TO, PATRONS HAVE TO INITIATE A COMPLAINT, FIRST, IN ORDER TO GET A RUDE AND OBNOXIOUS A$$HOLE OFF THE CELL?????????  Obviously, they were more considerate to the a$$hole, than the other families eating there.  We left and called the owners, Arturo and Teresa at the Maryland Pkwy. location and were told, "they weren't there".  We were given their cell number and have never received a call back, ever!!!!!!
4	Beats Denny's for a late breakfast. I stuck with my usual Waffle and a side of fresh fruit. My partner ordered the healthy looking variety breakfast. Lots of food and no complaints. Recommended.
5	I love this place for a good weekend spot to get breakfast or brunch. My husband likes thier sandwhiches and biscuits and gravy. I love their new day combo...two pancakes/french toast eggs and sausage. I recently took an older friend of mine and she liked her patty meltI go with my husband, parents, and friends. It is never overfilled and the service is excellent. I also love thier latte selection.You can also go on restaurants.com to get gift certificates for both locations
2	My trip here has inspired me to join yelp. I've been here a few times and it was one of mynfavorite places, but the other day after walking in the girl at the cash register told us to sit anywhere we like. Only about 7 tables were being occupied, wasn't busy, we headed towards a booth about half way there a waitress cut us off and for some reason pointed us towards a table, we mentioned we preferred a booth and sat down. She left some menus and walked away. She didn't ask if we wanted any drinks and just walked away. We waited about 4 minutes just watching the staff walk around before finally getting up to leave, the only person that noticed was the bus boy who shot a look around to see where the waitress was....she wasn't paying attention. Perfect ending was the under new management sign on the building....new management seems to be worse!
4	Another breakfast place that is consistent n food and staff are friendly. The prices are normal for breakfast places but if you are planning in advance, they sometimes have certificate available on restaurant.com. I also like this place because they offer chai lattes!
4	Ordered the Veggie Wrap and it came with chicken tortilla soup. It was fantastic.
4	Drove by this restaurant for the past few years, but xmas eve decided to give it a try. Small place but good service and large menu. I got a bacon, egg and cheese bagel, my wife got an omlette and I also ordered a side of biscuits and gravey. All were tasty and will definitely go back as it was a good value.
3	Food is alright, price is alright. service is alright didnt even bother to fill us water even there were no one at that time..
4	finally! a breakfast place that doesnt have just american style breakfast....like ihop.  its hard out here in vegas for a latino to find good local food (non strip) especially other than asian food lol. the menu is great, cheap prices about 20 bucks for 2, and great food. ive been trying every latino dish on here and so far theyre all good. staff is friendly and quick. however ive only been to the location on rainbow but im sure everything is just as good there.

3	I think I need to take my half star back.The food here has always been pretty solid. Lately I've noticed that the portions have shrunk, but the prices haven't. We came for a late breakfast after hitting the gym, so we were pretty hungry. I decided on a sandwich while my mom and fella got the chilaquiles. My meal was ok. The place has never really wowed me with their food, but it's always decent. Today was no exception. The only problem was that my mom and fella's food was oh so tiny. Their chilaquiles barely took up half of the plate, so they were disappointed to say the least. My sandwich was ok, but I had hoped for a little more oomph flavor-wise. Overall, we had an ok meal, but we'll probably try some other diners in the area when we're feeling extra hungry from our morning workout.
2	Not a fan. Portions were small and the food was just eh. My chilaquiles were half the size of the plate and they were soggy and flavorless. I've never been a fan, but they're usually worth it with a coupon, but this time they weren't. I don't think I'll be back.
2	I dig cafes and had a BOGO so decided to check this place out on my lunch hour. The food was decent, but then I was sick for two days after. I won't return!
5	Great food here and great prices
