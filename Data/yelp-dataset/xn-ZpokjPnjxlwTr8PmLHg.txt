5	The best thing about LPC is that they make GREAT looking cakes that TASTE good!  I am a cake and party fanatic and most places have beautiful fondant cakes that dont taste how they look, with lpc, the texture and taste is amazing- and they have so many options! Great people to work with!
4	My favorite thing about this business is what a great help they are to community groups from scout troops to local schools in arranging field trips and cooking days. My family has been ordering all different kinds of birthday cakes from this shop for about 3 years. They did a Dragon fantasy cake for my son's first birthday with a cute matching dragon smash cake, and a white tiger on orange cake to suit my daughter's unique themed birthday. This shop has been great with custom orders even with only 4 days notice. We have also ordered the pre-baked cake kit with the frosting and decorations in a box so the kids can decorate a cake for fathers day. Even when it is our kids messy creation the cake is still delicious, firm, yet moist. Our daughter has gone to the day camp and afternoon cooking experience and really enjoyed herself in addition to the support the shop has shown to her school. Yes the prices are a bit more than a typical sheet cake, but the quality is there. Mom should not have to suffer through bad cake! We do our parties at home so splurging on a cake is well worth it.
