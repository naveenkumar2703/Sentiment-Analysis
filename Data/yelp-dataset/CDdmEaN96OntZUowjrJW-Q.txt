3	Starbucks is a wildly popular brand, but as far as their coffee goes, there is better tasting coffee in KW. (matter of taste, williams coffee pub)What I like about this particular location is the amount of plugs available for people with laptops. No matter what seat you are in, you can find a receptacle to plug into. (not always the case at starbucks locations) Also there is free unlmited wifi - which makes a great place to meet for business over lunch.
4	Friendly service, a moderate amount of seating. Generally good. Up to the usual starbucks standard--if you like the franchise, and their coffee, you will be happy. If not, the you probably won't be here anyway! I believe they have tables set outside in the summer, but the seating area is right by the entrance and exit to the street, so that may be a deterrent to some. But the indoor portion of the cafe is nice--and as Joshua H. says, lots of plugins for laptops! Thumbs up.
4	This place is consistently busy, and I figure the folks come here for the same reason I do, for the tasty beverages, good service and cozy environment.  If you like Starbucks, you'll be happy to find this location, and there's often a number of patrons with their notebook computers open while consuming their lattes.In the wintertime, I love their Salted Carmel Hot Chocolate and come here often to get my fix, as I live in the area.The only downside to this location is that there is another location nearby on Fischer-Hallman that has a drive-through window, and I often go their for the convenience of not having to get out of my vehicle to get my fix, especially when the weather isn't co-operating.
