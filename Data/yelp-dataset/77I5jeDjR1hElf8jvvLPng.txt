3	Nice place that opened not too long ago in the Maryvale area. It has TONS of desserts on the menu, lots of little snacks, and is complemented by a small menu of Mexican junk food like chimichungas, carne asada fries, or sonoran hot dogs.When I first came here, I thought their take on the hot food available was unsatisfying, but as a work in progress they are making leaps and bounds in the right direction. Last time I came here my food was tasty!It has a bit of an identity crisis, however. Is it a restaurant? Is it a dessert shop? They do it all, but I haven't had anything that stood out yet. They'll keep getting better, and I'll update my review accordingly. Until then, I'll be stuffing my face with some fresas con crema. Yum!
4	I was very impressed by the nice staff and the morning Chorizo Burrito was so very tasty.
