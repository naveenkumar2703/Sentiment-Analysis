4	Good Food and really friendly people!  What really roped me in was the free samples they liberally give out.I settled on their Hawaiian Chicken and Steamed rice.  I'm a simple guy and this pretty much was what Panda Express was (I HATE PANDA EXPRESS) but their food was 20x better.  Their mac salad was delicious as well.  The wife had their noodles and garlic chicken.  Their prices are reasonable.  I would've expected it to be a bit more expensive because it was at a mall.A very good option at the Galleria Mall Food Court.  Will definitely eat there again.
3	I like Hawaiian Grill just fine.  It's not exactly gourmet or anything, but it sure beats Panda Express.  The chicken is always tender.  I like that they have vegetable options (despite the nature of my reviews, I AM pretty health-conscious).  Eh, it's mall food.  It's probably the best option at the Galleria.
4	Love the Garlic Chicken, and the macaroni salad is awesome! Just the way i like with choke mayonaise.
