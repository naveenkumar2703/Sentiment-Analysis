5	This place is one of the better cash advance places i have been too. Better rates than the competitors and the owner Dale is very willing to work with you if you are late on making a payment.  The non corporate is a major appeal!!
5	Place is good, no hassle. I believe it is Native American owned and i like to help those businesses cause lets face it, we stole all their land. Friendly place, I was a bit late on a payment with no drama, a perk you won't get with the big names (trust). I would definitely do business with them again.
5	This is the best loan center there is in vegas. They are they to help you if you need it! I just have fantastic things to say about this place not only are the employees very nice and helpful but, go above and beyond to help. I totally recommend this place if you need emergency money or are in a difficult time.
