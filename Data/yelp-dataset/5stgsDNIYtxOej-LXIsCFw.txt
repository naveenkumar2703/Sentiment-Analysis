5	Best in town
5	PAUL, my hero, my barber.For years and years, he has taken care of me with his consistent, immaculate fades.  Why would I ever need to go anywhere else?  Well, I guess when Paul goes on vacation, Max, Tony and Roman are always ready and have all the skills and tools necessary to deliver any kind of cut.Walk-ins only.  Comfortable and plentiful seating.  Can get REALLY busy at peak times, but worth the wait.  Sports, Spike, or A&E are always on the flatscreen TVs they have mounted over the mirrors.
5	Great barber shop. Went here the first time and will be going back. The shave your neck which is key.
5	All these guys are great and I love that they use a straight razor to shave my neck and all the edges. Great job guys!!!
5	This is my barber shop of preference. Been going here for a year now, they do a good job and  are really friendly people. Paul does the best job with my hair.
5	I was working in AZ for a couple of weeks and needed a haircut (fade) Tony cleaned me up just as good as my regular barber and for the same price! Looks like I found my AZ barber.
