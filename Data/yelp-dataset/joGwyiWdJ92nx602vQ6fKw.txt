4	We don't have a Staples in Alaska so this was first visit to one.It reminded me a lot of what Office Max sets their store up. Although I love the selection a lot more. I came in for envelopes and unfortunately they didn't have a smaller box than the 100 envelopes for the regular sized ones. I only needed about 15-20. I guess I will leave the rest in my hotel room...maybe someone can make use of the rest.I was a little disappointed though, and maybe this was a smaller store but I have heard many people say Staples is awesome and even though some of their selection was better than the other office stores around I wasn't too impressed after all the hype it was given.
1	Not a good experience......The people working at customer service acted like we didn't exist and acted like their job was sooo hard. All I wanted to do was exchnage some ink cartridges for some coupons. I was new to this myslef and they expected me to know everything about it. I will not be coming back to this location.
1	Staples has lost their way. Back in the late eighties they hit the ground running with discount pricing on office supplies and quickly gobbled up market share.Today, they are a large company and seem to subscribe to the "Gordon Gekko" mantra "That greed is good". My son and I went looking for a high end backpack that could stand the stress of a lap top and some heavy duty books. That backpack was over $100 dollars. I guess it was on sale from $130. We should all be so lucky to snag a $100 plus backpack (can you feel my sarcasm?).So I decided to think outside the box and went into one of those sporting goods stores and snagged a better backpack (since it could accommodate a larger PC) in the $45 dollar range.
