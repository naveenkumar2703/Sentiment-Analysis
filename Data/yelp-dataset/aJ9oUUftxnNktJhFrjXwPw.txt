4	Located in the huge strip mall with Home Depot.  This Staples has occasionally opened a few minutes late, and a few of us outside were obviously not happy about waiting by the locked gate.  They close early too.  Most of the staff is friendly here and checkout lines move fairly well.  Computer support is quick and cheap IF you have a small problem.
3	Expensive, but always has the printer cartridges I need in stock, so really can't complain.
1	Incredibly rude service from Andrea on Sept. 13. Clearly annoyed I was"interrupting her" to make my purchase. I will not use this location ever again.
1	Worst store I've ever been to. They never have anything in stock, they refuse to honor discounts, and they have the rudest staff I've ever encountered. Hope this place goes out of business.
