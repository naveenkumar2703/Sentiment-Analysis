1	Randomly closed 45 minutes before posted hours indicate. Sole employee watched me pull in, puzzled, and circle around the lot and decided to duck back inside the dark office. First - and last - attempt to patronize this business.
3	I've gone to Jiffy Lube in the past for oil changes and this location is very similar to most that I've been to. Overall I was satisfied with the oil change and the speed of service. My major complaint (and I have found this is true for most oil change places, including other Jiffy Lubes) is that they are always trying to get you to upgrade your oil or perform other costly repairs that you, as a car owner, may have no idea if are needed.  They convinced me after several minutes of flipping through computer menus that I should upgrade to synthetic oil because the mail-in rebate didn't make it that much more expensive.  At checkout I realized they hadn't explained the mail-in rebate correctly (it's only credit towards your next oil change) and I regretted my decision.

1	My wife went in to get an oil change today. By the time they were done explaining all the things that were "wrong" with her car she was shocked it still functioned. See I was at the same location a few months ago and all was well. Now a woman goes in and that car fell apart according to the staff. Even better they said she needed to pay more because the vehicle will take 7 quarts of oil rather then the standard 5 quarts. So they up charged her for that but again when I was in somehow the car only needed 5 quarts. Oh and according to the owners manual the car only can hold 5 quarts. I wonder where the other 2 went? I would suggest avoiding this location.
