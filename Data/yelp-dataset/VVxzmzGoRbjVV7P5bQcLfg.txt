5	Awesome service. The man behind the counter was extremely knowledgeable about his products. High end merchandise. He is the only vape shop i have been to that sells PG free all natural oil. no artificial flavors or any of that other nasty chemicals. His prices are fair and he is very friendly. He will go through every type of juice he has and give you a date (fruit) to clear your taste buds so you can taste the differences in the flavors. Truly one stop shop. I live in phoenix and i drive to Scottsdale just because he has awesome customer service and the best products around for a very fair price. Also, he is super clean. Everything is germ free and that is huge for me because i am a germ freak. Seriously, so yourself a favor go to vape sky. Awesome!
5	This store was awesome for a beginner!  John was extremely friendly, patient, helpful and genuine.  I would definitely recommend it.  Nice, new, small and not overwhelming.  I officially smoked my last cigarette and will enjoy this new contribution to my lungs and environment.  Thanks so much!!
1	Tacky. I arrived at this establishment at 10:00 waited in hopes the store would open. Finally, at 10:20 I left & will have to take my business elsewhere.
