1	Amazing -- I ordered the same sundae I ordered at a Mesa DQ yesterday and was charged $1.04 more for it here.  That ain't sales tax and when I asked about it, I got a lot of lip.  So, if you like price-gouging by a staff with an attitude, c'mon down to fashionable Apache Junction!
4	gotta love dairy queen.  This one has good service and seems clean.
4	Went hiking in the superstitions. Great day, we are driving back to Scottsdale and I see the DQ sign. I haven't had a peanut buster parfait since college in 1980. I hit it pretty hard. You aren't going to live forever you know?
2	I love Dairy Queens and "have never met one that I didn't like" but this one comes close. It is dirty. The windows are gross. The landscaping needs lots of attention. They turn off the Pepsi machine so you can't get a refill. This store needs lots of attention.
1	Very dirty very slow and bad customer service. They should be embarrassed. And they charged me 35 cents for mustard. WTF
1	Filthy filthy resturant, the cooler system they used to hold items had mold, filthy booths, dirty windows, run down building, 0 dollars are going back in to the appearance , or equipment I could see from the counter , the ice cream was good, but I coulndt get over how dirty and old the place looked . I would bet DQ, would shut this one down , if they seen this joint!
5	Great ice cream! I especially love the mud pie blizzard which has oreos cocoa fudge and coffee syrup in it. Amazing combination!
