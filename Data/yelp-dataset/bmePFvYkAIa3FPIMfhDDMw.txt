4	Nice country themed bar...not really divey enough for my taste but everyone was very friendly and nice. They closed down early so we went across the street to something like La Cabana or whatnot. Only 4 stars because it wasn't divey enough, lol. Other than that, they have an awesome outdoor smoking section, I believe they serve food, and thats about all I know. It was pretty busy around 8 pm on the weekenight I went there.
4	Cute setting, good service.  Salad bar was ok.  The beef vegtable soup was delicious & I think homemade.  Philly Steak sandwich was tender and delicious.  The country fried steak was tender and the best I've ever had.  Conversely their prime rib is the worst anyone in our family has ever had.
1	Worst food in 2011, and that includes food trucks and fast food. It looked like an old place that had been around a long time, and I usually have good luck with places like that - not htis time. I had the "samon fillet" which was extremely dry and tasteless - I have had beef jerky with a higher moisture content - the best thing on my plate were the soggy unseasoned canned greenbeans. My wife got the liver and onions, and no one was able to eat two bites - dry, gritty, horrible. One of my sons had the fried shrimp special, and that was the only OK plate (and the only one in the family that actually finished his dinner) - it was just typical deep fried shrimp from a bag of frozen, but at least it was not scr*wed up. I noticed that there were many more people in the bar than the dining section, so the drinks may be OK, but I will never try the food again.
4	LOVE-LOVE this bar, it's my kind of place!Great drinks and awesome service. Food was pretty good too, I really enjoyed the Salad bar.  We ordered a Ribeye, and while it wasn't the best I ever had I didn't have any complaints either.
3	Potato salad is delicious. Nachos were really good. This place was a pleasant surprise. Service was very efficient and friendly.
