3	As far as fast food goes, I love Chick-fil-a. The service at this location is good, had an issue with an order here and there but they are willing to fix it. I am not as sold on their breakfast menu as the day time options are much better.
2	My daughter loves it, but I cannot stand the food, the noise, or the horrible parking.
4	I've never  been to the CFA, but I was in Mesa at a conference, and my colleague loves CFA, so that's where we went.   I know the political incorrectness, but I actually love the food and the ambiance.  The place is clean, not noisy, not crowded; there are servers who bring the food to you, and refill the drinks. The service is a little slow, but not that bad.   The chicken sandwich was deliciously fried, with tomato and lettuce (I got the deluxe).  The waffle fries were not crispy, but not greasy (my only reason for the four not five stars).  All in all,everything was delicious, especially the peach milkshake, which was topped with whipped cream.  I would go again.
4	The food and service were excellent! I do get a little bugged out by the amount kids and noise. Great place, service and food otherwise if you can deal with lots of people, noise and crowded parking lot you'll be OK.
3	Typical fast food place.Food is great as usual because you can't go wrong with the chicken sandwich. The clerk was really nice too but not sure if he will be back next time.I noticed that there is a playground there which meant lots of kids roaming about. It could be a good thing or a bad thing depending if you like kids.Pretty clean but the one by Mill ave is cleaner and more modern and more decorated.
