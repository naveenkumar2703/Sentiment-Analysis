4	This hotel is a little old, but well kept up and very clean. The staff is friendly and helpful and, if you are a repeat visitor like I am, they will recognize you.There is free high-speed internet, a nice pool, basic toiletries and such, satellite TV, and a tasty "Morning Medley" breakfast. Dogs are apparently allowed, as I have seen two guests with them.The Sleep Inn is located in literally the same parking lot as the Superstition Springs Mall and is within ten miles of Target, K-Mart, Walgreens, Wal Mart and many, many other shopping and dining facilities. Room Service is available through the 5 and Diner located next door.Bottom line: Cheapest rate in the area, clean rooms, friendly staff, A+ location.
5	This is a nice hotel, not the best, but it's nice. It was great for the price, especially the free breakfast. However, the reason for the five stars is not for the actual hotel, which was clean, comfortable, but not super special. The rating for this hotel is for the staff. They were friendly, sweet, helpful and took far of problems quickly. There were a couple of issues that came up that were no fault of the staff, but they took care of the problems quickly and with great customer service. An added plus is that the diner that shares a parking lot with the hotel is awesome.
2	Don't stay on the first floor, you hear every footstep and door closing from the second floor. The free breakfast is nothing special, after looking at the horde of people waiting for a waffle we decided to just go out to eat. Also, bring your own pillow unless you're into shoebox sized pillows. Other than those issues the accommodations were ok.
