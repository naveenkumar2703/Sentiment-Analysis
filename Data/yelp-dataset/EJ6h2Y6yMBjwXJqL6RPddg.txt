In fact, it's the only coffee I drink with cream and sugar because it just seems the right way. Don't ask me why I need MORE sugar in my coffee when I'm eating a bunch of donuts, that's just how it is. I do prefer the old fashioned, which has less sugar than the others, but the chocolate frosted version is growing o me as well.IMO, better overall donuts than KK or any other donut shop out in East Mesa.  For a treat, get the apple fritter and ask them to heat it up!
5	Love their ice coffee and the fact that a medium is only 99cents! This is the only place that I can get a mocha flavored iced coffee (not latte). I am seriously addicted and have to get my fix everyday!
5	Awesome coffee and doughnuts. Customer service is amazing too. They are not robots like other places... (Friendly humans, great attitude). Order a nice iced coffee and enjoy it outside with a friend. It is great ambient i guess. Not a tacky starbucks ambient, more open and hip?... And affordable. I recommend the vanilla bean iced coffee, with the sugar and creamer. It is really good. And keeps you going. After all, America does run on Dunkin. :)
