4	I had seen Sno Monkey parked at the gas station by my house last year but never got the chance to try it before they closed for the winter.  They are back and we were the first customers on opening day.  They weren't quite ready yet when we got there, no menu board, stuff not set up, no money so we needed exact change.  No big deal.  I'm sure its just a first day thing.  I got a small tigers blood and the kids got kid sized grape, bubble gum and watermelon.  Kids sizes are $1.50 and Small was $2.50.  I love that I can get my kids a cool treat for under $5 total.  That never happens.  The shaved ice was good.  Not as fluffy as Sno Ono but really who is?  This is a great option if you live in the area or are going to an event at Sam Boyd and need to cool off.
