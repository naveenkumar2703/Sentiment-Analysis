4	Tommy Bahamas Outlet is new to me, but we were very impressed with the offerings found in this high quality clothier.I've been to a few Tommy Bahamas over the years, mostly on the west coast.  Their clothes are of a very high quality and trendy.  Particularly if you you are walking off a beach or are in the island setting. That is not a snarky comment, but a statement on their style and appearance.  I like the look very much and was surprised that they had an outlet store.Virtually everything in the store is marked at 50% off, see photo. I also liked the steel drummer playing as you come to get you in the mood.  Very nice!
2	Beautiful colors and clothing and good value, but poor selection of XL and waist over 38.  If you're a skinny gent or lady, this is the store for you.  I guess "the good life" according to Bahama has no room for eating well ;)
