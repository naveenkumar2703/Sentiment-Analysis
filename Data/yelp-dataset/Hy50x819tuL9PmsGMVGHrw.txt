4	Lovely shop where you can buy all sorts of nice smelling stuff. Candles and perfume in unusual but very attractive scent combinations. Great place to get that special gift you've been looking for, if you're prepared to splash out a bit!
3	Located on George Street this branch of Jo Malone is quite small in size and seems to have taken the minimalist look a little bit too far as the shop almost looks completely empty. Perhaps it's because everything is white and it just looks like everything is bare and inside it's quite silent and rather than being approachable the staff just kind of looked at me which was a little off putting to say the least. Perhaps it was because I was looking a little scruffy with a hoody and my converse on or perhaps it had something to do with the fact that before I went in I took a picture of the shop for Yelp purposes and if they saw me they probably just thought I was a total weirdo.I do like Jo Malone products though and they are perfect for presents, I chipped in with a few friends to get a housewarming gift for another friend and I've bought my mum a few odd bath and body lotions from here too. The packaging is gorgeous and all purchases are put in white Jo Malone gift bags with pretty black ribbon so you don't need to worry about wrapping, it's good to give as soon as you leave the shop.
3	Every Christmas I go in here to buy my grandparents a Jo Malone candle. To be honest, that's about the only thing that I will buy from here, what with the price of everything else n all.It is super expensive.They have a great selection of cremes, perfumes and soaps, but I think their candle is the best. It lasts a full year (when used occasionally)  and smells great. I'm not such a big fan of their room-sprays, they're quite acidic and make the room smell worse.I begin to wonder how they make their money, there never seems to be anybody in this shop (other than at Christmas) and the prices are ridiculous!
