4	One of the largest Post Offices in the area and a great group!
4	Considering my affinity for the post office is akin to a root canal, a four-star review is sayin' something!I have a PO box here, and upon sign-up, the customer service agent took me to the box to 1) show me where it was in the rows upon rows of boxes, and 2) to make sure I, with my small stature, could reach it on the top row.  Much appreciated. I occasionally get mail for the apparent last owner of my PO box, and that appears fairly normal considering the random other pieces of mail sitting out.  They SHOULD have a PO box reject mail drop because it appears most people are just throwing that stuff away...For regular PO use, expect long, but decently fast moving lines at busy times.
5	Considering all the other Post Offices I have been to in or around Scottsdale, this has to be the best.  I stopped going into the one located on Rose Garden Lane by Desert Ridge to drive a few more minutes out of my way to this one.Why?  Because the employees are knowledgeable, helpful and actually run a pretty decent USPS location, which is mind blowing, I know!  I have never waited longer than 15 minutes and that's even with a super long line.  I think they run this location pretty efficiently and add cashier's as needed, i.e: if there is a long line.
1	I made a phone call to this postal office due to a package unable to be delivered because my address had been changed (which all my other mail was able to be forwarded). A man answered; I told him my situation and he placed me on hold for 8 min and then I was disconnected. I have been trying to call back and no one is answering. Great service (sarcasm)!
