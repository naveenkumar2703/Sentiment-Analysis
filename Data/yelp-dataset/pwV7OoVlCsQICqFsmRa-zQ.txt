2	Food is a little bland , not much variety , go there for the coffee if your forced to kill some time.
3	I'm giving the 3 stars solely for 1 reason: The veggie sandwich! There's normally only 1 person waitressing/taking orders, so expect a slow turn around during breakfast & lunch time. To avoid the crowds I'd pick up a flier in the morning, call around 10 am & pre-order for pick up. If I had no time to wait to check out I would simply ask for delivery. A girls gotta eat! :)
5	Great lunch place with delicious fresh sandwiches, soups and salads and an excellent wait staff.
3	Sweet potato pancakes, had to give them a try! They tasted very much like pumpkin pancakes, probably because of the spices. Still, they were good & really moist! The size is also nice, very normal, anyone could easily eat 3. In other places it seems like the pancakes are competing with the size of a human head, lol! The coffee was really mild. I never thought I'd say this, but it needs to be a little stronger. Call ahead with your order if you can. This place is a bit of a hang out & during 'peak' breakfast and lunch hours it gets busy.
