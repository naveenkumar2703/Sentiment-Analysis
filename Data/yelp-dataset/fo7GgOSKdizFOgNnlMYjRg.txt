5	Best haircuts in North Phoenix
2	Eric said " Best haircuts in North Phoenix " but he forgot to include, "if you like bruises and whiplash". I came to this place once and never came back. This place is fu**ing dark, creepy and downright scary. So i took a seat in the barbers chair and he went to work. This guy beat the living hell out of my head. I left there with scratches and bruises! I will admit, the fade was great ( Hence the additional star), but too bad my fu**ing head looked like i got into a fight with a wild Cheetah to enjoy it.
5	Second on "Best Haircut in North Phoenix"  Been going there for nearly ten years always a good cut.  Conversation is minimal unless you speak Russian. If you like a good ole' fashion no-nonsense cut and need to get in and out this is the place for you. For all the "Louie R's" stick to Beauty Shops...heck they might even give you a deal on getting your nails done.Bit higher priced than most Phoenix barbershops but the place is clean, roomy, they will do your mustache, eye brows etc for no extra charge and you get a back masage.Tip: pay with cash and you will save the 2 or 3 dollar ATM fee
4	Price is the same as going to Cost Cutters during the haircut sale day - so save the $ and go here. Its a well-appointed shop, nicely furnished and they offer all the traditional barber services. No appointments necessary. I'd go back. Conversation is non-existent, but that's okay by me!Also - the sign on the window says they buy gold...ummm...okay.
