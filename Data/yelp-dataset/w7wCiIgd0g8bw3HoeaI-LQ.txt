5	If you want a Realtor who will get the job done for you while looking out for your best interest, Sally is the Realtor for you! You may not have the energy to keep up with her as you watch her work circles around other average Realtors. Sally keeps on top of industry changes and will make sure you have all the information necessary to make the best choices and decisions. I highly recommend Sally for your real estate needs in Arizona!
5	Sally & her husband Mike were my life-lines when I was newly relocated to the Phoenix area!  I was working w/ another realtor who wasn't listening to anything I said or asked and never responded in a timely fashion.Sally & Mike have never told me no!  They have ALWAYS gone out of their way to make appointments work.  They never hesitated and they are super down-to-earth!  That's something I appreciate!  These 2 have been the BEST, hands down and I will be using them for myself and referring them to everyone.  If you want AMAZING service, choose Sally & Mike!!!
5	Tammy has been amazing every step of the way! When our credit union said they couldn't include my husband's income, she found me a mortgage broker who got us approved. When we needed to see a bunch of houses and the only day we had was Mother's Day, she didn't hesitate! She went out of her way to show us every house we asked for and answer every question we had. Always prompt, informed responses! She made what could easily have been an extremely stressful situation fun and made us feel confident about our decisions. We couldn't be happier!
