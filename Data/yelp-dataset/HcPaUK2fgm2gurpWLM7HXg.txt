5	I LOVE River Ridge. It is clean, staff is friendly, they have great vets and the rates are terrific. What more could you want.
5	River Ridge takes great care of my new puppy. They have excellent prices too.
5	We take our now 9 month Bull Terrier. We've taken Rex here since we bought him at three months. All of the staff there loves him, they're really kind with him since we know he's a real handful. We've only taken him to one other Vet but only because it was in the middle of the night.
5	I have taken both my dog and cat to River Ridge, where they receive excellent care every time. Recently, my cat was bitten by another cat, resulting in multiple abscesses. Each time a new abscess formed, River Ridge went out of their way to get her in as soon as possible and get her treated for amazing prices. She's on the mend now and it's all thanks to them :)
