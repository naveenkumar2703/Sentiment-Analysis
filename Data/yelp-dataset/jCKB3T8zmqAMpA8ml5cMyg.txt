5	This place is amazing!  Brenda is very knowledgeable and she recommended a skin care regimen that has really been working for me. She gives great assessments on your current skin conditions and provides tips to maintain.  What I love most about AZ Premier Dermatology is their commitment to natural beauty. They simply believe that healthy skin is beautiful skin. They believe in the confidence that having healthy skin can bring to someone. The never "push" products you don't need. In fact, they frequently help me find something that works for me that I can also afford! They use products with natural ingredients that fall in line with my personal product philosophy. I have complete faith in Arizona Premier Dermatology for all my skin needs!
5	Just had to write this review about AZPremier Dermatology. Love it! The staff are warm and friendly. Brenda takes the time to chat with you before your exam. She is extremelyexperienced ,and has such insight and knowledge into skin care and any issues you may be having.You just trust her with any recommendation she suggests.  They do not there products but do make suggestions . So glad I found them and will definately go back and would recommend to anyone to check them out.
5	I see Dr. Anna O'Bannon at this office.  I am absolutely impressed with her knowledge specifically Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis.  She is warm and friendly and cares about the patient overall in my opinion.  Front office staff is polite, friendly and efficient.  What more could you ask for?!
