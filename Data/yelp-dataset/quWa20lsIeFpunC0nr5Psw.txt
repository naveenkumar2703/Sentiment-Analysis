5	We met with several landscaping companies in the valley, and J.E.P landscaping was the best. Jario Effrain Palafox was honest, hard working, and did the job right. Regardless of the price, he was hands down the most honest, customer focuses contractor we've ever worked with. It was really nice to find someone we can trust, and know they do good work. After meeting with some of the 'big guys', and getting bids from people at home shows, we didn't think we were ever going to be able to afford getting our yard done. Little did we know, majority of the people we met with were overcharging us, and just trying to sell us on anything. Effrain wasn't like that at all. He suggested a few things, gave an honest quote, that blew everyone away, and landscaped our entire backyard in 4 days. Our yard wasn't easy. There was old landscaping, rock, and irrigation to remove. He cleared it all out, put in new irrigation, grass, curbing, rock, paver walkways, plants, lighting, and transformed our entire yard. We've recommended him to a couple friends, and they were both really happy with his work. He's a young, hard working, honest contractor you can trust. Give him a chance, you wont be disappointed.
5	I'm so happy we hired Jario & his team to help us clean up our yard.  The entire team is hard working, professional, kind, and gets the job done right.  Their quality of work is top-notch & I would not hesitate hiring them again!Thank you so much J.E.P Landscaping!
1	I saw the wonderful reviews and called to schedule an initial walk-through. We made plans for a certain day, and I got a text early in that day saying that they would not be here on time. We talked about rescheduling for the following day when they said they were free. They never got back to me on that, (even though I saw that they had received the messages due to the iPhone read message receipt feature.) I called and texted. No response. It's been 3 days now. Nothing. So disappointed.
