4	Yay, we found a cleaners that knows how to properly clean and press cloths and has great customer service! Cameo cleaners in Anthem offers several services on all types of clothing and linens including alterations.    They are conveniently located in the Safeway shopping center so it's an easy in and easy out. They have a convenient drive through for easy drop off and they offer free pick up and delivery to their regular customers.  Their prices are in line with the other cleaners in the area but what sets them a part from the others?  They offer next day pick up every day and same day service on items dropped off by 9am!  This is a HUGE + for us for last minute business trips.
