5	I went here for a wedding and it was the most amazing location for a wedding in AZ that I have been too. If I ever were to get married in AZ (0% chance of that), this would be the spot where I would want to do it. This was at just one of the many clubhouses in the Desert Mountain community which is in uber upscale north Scottsdale. The Cochise/geronimo clubhouse was a mixture of contemporary/desert style.  Enormous windows over looking the amazing views of the desert mountains. The Patio was huge and accommodated around 125 people to watch the amazing sunset over the mountains. The food they served was pretty descent for wedding food. I just had the pasta, but the salad was a cucumber avocado salad that was def the most fancy wedding salad I have had. The bathroom had all the great upscale amenities like mouthwash, sunscreen and lotion. If you are planning on getting married soon in AZ and have a ton of cash to blow I suggest checking this place out as it will blow your guests away!
5	You can't go wrong doing anything at Desert Mountain. The Cochise/Geronimo clubhouse is spectacular with a view of the entire valley that is un-matched. Give the Chiracuaha golf course a try you won't find a better layout in the state.
5	Came here for a wedding and it was breath taking.  Wedding ceremony on held on the one of the driving areas that overlook the golf course and into the city.  The sunset was just beautiful.  The clubhouse has amazing and relaxing environment.  We had drinks on the patio (great for photos).  Had heater lamps so we ate on the other side of the patio.  The food was pretty good.  Steaks, chicken, and fish.  Tons of sides and bread.  Service was top notch (bar, servers, etc.).  +++Rabbits & family of deer spotted in the background!
