5	Great acoustics
5	Originally from Oxnard locale but moved to Vegas locale six years ago, and after moving two locations since I've been here Las Vegas locale is blessed to finally have it's own house of worship. I've been a member of the Church of Christ, Iglesia ni Cristo for all my life 25 years strong and many more years to come. If you have any questions about your faith come attend a service or even a bible study or two. Service at Vegas locale are Wed @ 7am 10am & 8pm, Sat @ 7pm, and Sun @ 7am & 10am.

5	This is one of 3 locales in the greater Las Vegas area. I go here sometimes because of my work schedule or I have plans for a certain day that I just cant make it to my assigned locale. That's what's great about these locales. The worship service times can pretty much fit everybody's schedule. So if you are ever looking to answers pertaining to your faith, I highly recommend checking any one of these locales out. There are always bible studies goin on and the ministers there will always answer your questions straight from the bible meaning they will not tell you their own interpretations. If you want to attend one and are a bit shy, just hit me up and I will go with you. You can also look up our website for more informaional videos, www.incmedia.org
