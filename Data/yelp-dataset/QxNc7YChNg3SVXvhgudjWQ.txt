1	"Rude Employees"  Will never Go to another Sherwin-Williams store again.I walked into this store and. I asked one of the lady's at the front counter if she could give me some advise and show me the different paints. She rudely pointed in the direction and said over there. My girlfriend and i walked over to the paints and waited and waited. She never came out from the counter to help us. We looked at all the paints on our own. I saw a 5 Gallon bucket of paint went back to the counter waited until the lady's returned from the back storage room, and asked them the price of the 5 gallon bucket of paint. I was rudely asked if i was a contractor, when i said no, they told me i wasn't allowed to buy this paint. I told both of them i have never ben treated so rudely by any sales person, before in my life. I told them i was going to speak to there district manager about the way they treated my girlfriend and myself, the girl wearing blue, and purple eye shadow, said i don't care who you call. The store was completely empty, nothing was going on in the store. But they still made my girlfriend and i feel like we were a bother to them and didnt need our business. They made us feel like it was a major inconvenience, to even wait on us.I can see why now the store was totally empty. I would rather go to Home Depot or Lowes and buy paint. The paint might not be as good as Sherwin-Williamss but at least there employee's treat paying customers with respect, and don't treat them like garbage.
5	Excellent customer service and patience as my custom paint match and sheen was expertly matched to perfection.  Specifically, Tess was most helpful in all aspects of the process ensuring me that my end product would be perfectly matched.  Thank the entire staff for their patience and excellent service!I would recommend this store very highly for  all services.
