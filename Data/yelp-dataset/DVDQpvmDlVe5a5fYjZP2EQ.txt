5	When coming to AZ, I was looking for an Anglican church that fit my criteria, and so far Christ Church Anglican doesn't disappoint. If you love the beauty and liturgy of the Anglican church, and want a Biblically orthodox church, give CCA a try. They love visitors, and no pressure. The members are involved in a lot of things from mission outreach (in PHX and afar) to going on local hikes. The Sunday service is at 9 a.m., followed by what they call Adult Education -- that's basically a talk over in the parish hall, the subject of which varies from one Sunday to the next. Everyone has coffee and snacks first, though, and then enjoys the talk. Child care is provided for most functions. The church is on N 20th Street, on the right just before 20th St dead-ends into Bethany Home.
5	Grounded in Scripture, rich in history, active in the community, warmly welcoming, and refreshing for my soul. My husband and I have found a great church home.
5	This has been our home church for 2 years. It's a thoughtful and increasingly multi-generational, healthy, and missional church. We love it!
