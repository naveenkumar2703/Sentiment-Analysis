4	It's a tough call to not give this event a 5 star rating...Axis of Awesome totally rocked the Gilded Balloon, with songs of modern living and social commentary; songs about KFC and teenage drinking, Harry Potter and writing floppy guys off as a tax deductable item.Reviewing an Axis of Awesome concert has an element of "situational humour" (you had to be there), and the musical stylings go beyond the obvious comparisons of Flight of the Conchords or Tim Minchin - each are doing their own individual homage to musical parody with totally different styles.But the sheer....intelligent idiocy? of Axis of Awesome achieves some real belly laughs, sprinkled with a little well-timed cringing.It's hard to pick favourites but the KFC song, the pimped-out parody of "Can you hear the $%^&* music comin outta my car" and the medley of the four-chord song had me in stitches.Well worth the ticket price while Axis of Awesome are at the Gilded Balloon, or finding out if they're coming to a theatre near you..!
4	First of all, excellent name. Not a clue where it comes from, but it is wonderful.This is a solid place to see a show. I was here for the Fringe and saw a few things throughout the weekend here. All of them comfortable, great sound, lots of fun. The only issue it really has against it is it's a maze. Trying to get anywhere in here is a journey. They do their best at labelling and putting up signs, but I think I still had to ask someone each time I wanted to get anywhere.But it's a slight price to say for an excellent show venue. Got a chance to see something here? See it.
