1	This may very well be the scariest Walgreen's in all of existence! Lets set the scene. Its Saturday night at about 10pm. My sister and I are having a yard sale bright and early the next morning...The hubs and I run out of stickers to price our sweet items. Off to Walgreen's we go. I cant even begin to describe the clientele. They could have rivaled ANY of the people that you see on Peopleofwalmart.com FOR FREAKEN SERIOUS. The place was a shambles and there were seriously about 10 people in front of us in line. Its dirty, its scary, I will not be going in there again. I will take my chances at a Walmart next time, at least there I know what to expect!
1	Staff is rude and lack general knowledge of medication.  Pick another chain for this area.
3	As fas as Walgreens goes, this one ranks just barely above the location on 35th avenue and Camelback. The store is always a bit dirty looking. There is almost always only one cashier working and takes forever to get in and out of there. 3 stars because the pharmacy staff is really nice.
1	There was no public restroom to use even though I was a paying customer. I put my items back....plenty of other more courteous Walgreens to go spend money at. DISAPPOINTING.
