4	I like this location because I can get in and out quick everything does seem pretty fresh and the Employees are nic.
5	Can't believe I am just now rating this place! Yesterday I bought like 6 packs of organic zucchini here because regular was 1.99 for a 3 pack and organic was 2.49 for the 3 pack and the regular was even on sale! They had a great organic selection at outstanding prices. They are a British company so many banned in Europe (horrible for you) products are left out of their selection (yipeeee) and they have the BEST organic ketsup on the planet :). Oh and they were open on thanksgiving. 5/5+++ thanks F&E outstanding grocery. Oh and it's 100% self check out which I don't mind.Not for me but great dinner for 2-3 packs in every meat/veggie selection! Possible. Good all natural pre made lunch options as well. Like having a personal chef or meal planner! :).
5	Love this place !! This location is so close to my house makes it easy to stop in get what I need fast and easy !!!
5	Fresh and Easy had always been a favorite. They have changed pretty drastically over the last year, but I always love the wide selection of all natural foods and their marked down expiring items process.
