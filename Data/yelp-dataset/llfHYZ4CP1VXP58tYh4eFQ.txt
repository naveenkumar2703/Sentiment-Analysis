5	Pete the water guy is the best.  I've had he and his crew do everything from service my RO system, install a hot water recirculator, water heater, and a hose bib.  Very personable, quality, and the price is right.  I don't like to pay too much but I've paid too little and that really cost me.  You get both quality and value with Soft Water Plus.
5	I have trusted these guys with my water treatment needs originally moving to Anthem, AZ in 2001. They installed a reverse osmosis unit as well as a water softener and replaced the original water heater after the original one decided to die on us. They have also done other various plumbing services including installing a hot water recirculating pump which I absolutely love the benefits. All the products they have installed have performed very well and the level of service and attention to detail is unmatched.
5	I've had Pete come to our house in Anthem twice. The first time was to disconnect our expensive water heater when we moved then to reconnect it (along with a new valve for car washing) in the new house. He was on time, had the parts the job needed and cleaned up afterward (that's actually a bigger deal than it sounds). The second time was to change our RO filters. At the same time, he asked if I wanted him to flush the water heater (no charge). Wow. I couldn't ask for better service. Great prices too. Boom!
