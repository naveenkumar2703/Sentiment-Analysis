5	Steven Wade came out to our place of business and was very thorough in his assessment of our company, Pro-Glass. He was very prompt at making sure he was giving us the best deal for the coverage we required. His bid came in lower than any other company for the same amount of coverage, and Cook Insurance is now saving us over $500.00 a year. Thank you for your expertise, your thoroughness and your care in accomplishing all of our business Insurance needs!I will be greatful to refer Cook Insurance to other businesses who want great service & coverage for a better price!
5	I had shopped for business insurance to get the best rate and coverage for quite a while and settled on, what I thought was a fair price. Then I met Steve from Cook Insurance. He showed me how I could have the same coverage for far less than what I was paying. I am so grateful to Steve for saving me over 30% on my premiums. I would recommend him to anyone!
