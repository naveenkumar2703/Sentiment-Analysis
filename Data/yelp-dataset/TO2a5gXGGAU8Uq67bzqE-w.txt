1	Are you kidding me? I went to this place for lunch last week as I was waiting for my appointment with the no so genius staff at the Genius Bar at the Apple store down the road.... Thats another story... But I digress.... Anywho, This place absolutely sucks... Indian buffet scares me anyway, but this place takes it to a whole new level....The Naan was dry, the was a choice of almost nothing in the buffet... I almost walked out, but since I was there and wanted to review, I couldn't accomplish my mission without taking my life in my hands and trying it.... Good news, I'm still alive.... Bad news is, I am losing faith that good indian food exists in the valley
4	I had a very different experience here, but I did not order from the buffet I ordered to go I had takiki Marsala, Channa Marsala and some lovely veg samosas. This was the first time I went to this place the food was good...some of the best that I have tasted. I will definitely go to this place again the staff was friendly and I guess I am going to have to try the buffet.
4	I have been to this place 4 times, all for the buffet and all were good.Their Tandoori is decent, they always have some varied vegetable selections and the Tikka is pretty good for a buffet.They have a varied selection and the staff are always friendly and helpfulI like that you can get garlic naan with the buffet.I have nto yet ordered off the menu there....
