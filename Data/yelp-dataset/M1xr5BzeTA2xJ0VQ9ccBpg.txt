3	Yes, your retinas will be permanently burned from the flashing of the light off the thousands of sequins and swarovski crystals.  Yes, the sales people are incredibly rude, unless you are spending serious cash.  Yes, it is absurdly overpriced.However:When they have sales, they do not fuck around.  $80 t-shirts from my favorite esoteric LA designers for $20 - you really can't beat that, especially when there are loads of normal, basic colors like white, black, gray, etc... no settling for last season's tangerine.  Also, the jewelry, while sometimes ridiculous, can be very nice - diamonds and gold - and edgy, like I like it (pave diamond razor blade necklace for me, thank you).  Therefore, I brave the bitchy sales people and anorexic crowds whenever they have a sale.  It's worth the drive and the hassle, because I get excellent quality stuff that I love for cheap.
1	This store is so suburban 1998.  Everything is embellished or bedazzled.  The woman who owns the place is probably one of the rudest people i have ever met in my life.  She is about 68 years old and dresses like she is 12.  The prices are very high.  Don't waste your money or time.
