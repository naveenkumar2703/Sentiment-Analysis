5	Clean, well staffed. Well stocked. Full service CVS, as most are. Photo, pharmacy w/ drive-thru, the typical abundant convenience and health-care items. Still expensive, but friendly people.
4	I was feeling under the weather and my boss encouraged me to go get checked out. I pass this CVS almost daily and noticed the Minute Clinic sign so I decided to give it a try.I signed in via their computer kiosk, not 2 minutes later I was called back for my check up.I was evaluated by their ANP and she decided on my diagnosis, prescribed my medication and told me what else I can do to get better. And if I wasn't feeling better or got worse to just call the clinic. It was fast and easy. You can even have your meds filled right there if you like. And they take most insurances.It was very convenient not to have to sit in a room full of other "sickies" for hours. Hopefully I won't need them again, but I'd go back if necessary.
4	Great pharmacy staff! They are always timely in making sure my prescriptions are filled on time, and if there is any kind of a delay they will call and advise.  They have always been so helpful!Super helpful to use the text alerts- lets you know when your prescriptions/refills are ready for pick up!Use your extra rewards cards for points!
