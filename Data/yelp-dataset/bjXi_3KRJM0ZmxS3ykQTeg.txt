1	About 2 years ago, I went here  to get an MP3 player and the associate talked me in to getting the extended warrenty. Basically, you pay something like $50 and if you decide you want to upgrade your product, they apply the original purchase price towards your next purchase. Sounds simple enough. Wrong! Turns out, I'd have to ship the player back to their distribution site and wait for them to issue a card with the balance on it. This was not how this product was explained to me.But my frustration doesn't end with this silly policy. The employees here are always more focused on making calls on their cell phones and then get pissy when you start asking questions.If you don't know your products, get educated on them or find a coworker who knows. Don't just say "Um, I really don't know" and turn around on me.

Normally I don't like going into electronic stores but the people there made it fun, always joking and being very friendly. I really recommend this store, I'm definitely going back. : D
5	So, I happened into this Radio Shack because I was next door at the Walmart trying to return something and buy a few other electronics and I about committed a felony out of frustration. All those people are nuts, customers and staff alike. Anyways..... I walked over to this Radio Shack, and not only was a greeted by several people with a smile and hello, they helped me find what I was looking for quickly, AND the most important, they left me alone when I wanted to wonder around the store on my own. Love this place I will be back again!
3	Has some electronics component which are decent if you are in a pinch. Over all not the electronic wiring nerd paradise it used to be, but a decent place to start.
