5	One of those businesses with old school integrity.  I needed a small piece of glass trimmed down for an aquarium top and they treated me like I was a million dollar client.  A week later I broke the top and Bell Glass cut me another from scratch, again they went above and beyond to take care of me.
5	Small company. Great service. Fast turn around time and great prices. What more can you ask for?
5	I bought a used bookcase that needed two glass shelves replaced. I went to Bell Glass because they had two- 5 star reviews and they were nearby. The shelves were perfect, ready the next day, and very reasonably priced. I will be back to Bell Glass for any future glass needs.
5	I broke a glass in a custom picture frame that needed replacement. I called Michaels and they said the size I needed cut would cost me $30. I came here instead and walked out 2.5 minutes later with the cut glass I needed and they only charged me $5. Would absolutely recommend!
5	Fantastic!  Super-fast and friendly service.  I had a small heart-shaped picture frame that needed the glass replaced.  They treated me like I was a million dollar client and I was in and out in under 5 minutes.I would absolutely recommend this company to anyone for any type of glass needs...
5	Great family owned business. Very responsive quick service. They are the only ones in Arizona for classic auto glass. They also have the cleanest shop I have ever seen. Keep up the great work.
