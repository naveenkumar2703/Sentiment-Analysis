5	I am so impressed with this company.    I hired them to setup their booth at an event I was hosting in December.   They were there even before I arrived.  They had everything under control and there was no need for me to micro manage that area of the event.  It was indeed a pleasure having someone that was able to come in, do their thing and need very little assistance if any from their client.     They provided fun props and by the end of the night even the shy, conservative, always in control me was in the booth having some fun times with my pals!   They give their clients a photo strip of their photos to take home and as a business owner, they had my logo on the strip)   Within a few days, they have the photos loaded online where you can go and view and order more photos or even promotional products.    I love the concept and love Jil-Marie and her husband.  They really do want to make you feel like a celebrity!
5	Celebrity Photobooth is fantastic! I used their services for my wedding and it was a BIG HIT :) everyone loved it and I even received discs of all the photos afterwards which was mailed to me by Jill Marie who by the way is great to work with. She also sent me a link to the photo gallery of my event while the discs were still on its way to me. I had an album to take home with photos and comments from my guests which was such a sweet surprise and a most definite keepsake. I highly recommend this company for any event XO
5	Excellent .  They were very professional for my friend's son's birthday party.  They brought props and stayed for the entire party.  They arrived early, and started taking pictures 15 min before they were supposed too...and didn't charge any extra.
5	Great photo booth, highly recommend them. Their hi tech equipment and green screen gives you all sorts of options and social media kiosk for tagging sharing. Give them a call for your next party or reception.
