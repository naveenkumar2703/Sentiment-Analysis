4	This is a huge, noisy, very colorful food market with the same layout that you'd find in the other Pro's Ranch markets.  Lots and lots of inexpensive food items including many things you won't find in most supermarkets, especially if you're looking for ingredients for Mexican cuisine. The market is well-organized, with distinct areas with huge signs - Carniceria, Pescaderia, Jugos, etc. And do try the in-store eatery / taqueria which serves good street tacos, enchiladas, and other standard mass-appeal Mexican dishes.
4	I really with we had one close to us out here in Surprise! The prices are great! I stopped in to grab a healthy quick lunch for the hubby and I to have as a picnic :) whole grilled chicken, big (fresh and sweet) fruit salad, enormous beet/carrot/apple/celery juice and we were set under $20, more like $16!! At whole foods it would have been $30 easy.  I get it, they are a world apart, but all in all, healthy and way less money!
5	All I have to say is the store director Michael knows how to make sure any mistakes are resolved and taken care of. Michael went out of his way to make sure our daughter received the correct cake and even had his team go out of their way to deliver it. Highly recommended place to order cakes for birthday parties.
4	I like this ranch market, very big and you can find everything you need here, got fresh fruits and vegetables. Recommended this market over other that is nearby. And this in in a good location in to get in and out.
