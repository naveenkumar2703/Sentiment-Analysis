1	I went to this dentist without any patient referral because I needed to get in quick and they accepted my insurance. Well, they got me in the very next day, but it was one of the worse experiences that I've had at a dentist's office. The dentist (I cannot remember his name), came in and introduced himself. I informed him that I had sensitive gums and had problems in the past with the ultrasonic cleaner being very painful. He said "okay" and started working. It seemed as though he was working very quickly and every time the ultrasonic thing touched my gums I would jump and tense up. After a few minutes he took a break and asked me how I was doing. I told him that it was hurting very bad and his exact response "Suck it up. You'll be fine." Wow. That's all I can say about that. Needless to say, I didn't go back to this office. And, it wasn't my problem that it was hurting so bad. My new dentist uses the ultrasonic cleaner every visit and I have very little discomfort. I guess it doesn't have to hurt if you're a caring & compassionate dentist.
5	Dr Norton and his staff are friendly and professional. They have made my 3 children feel relaxed and comfortable. I highly recommend this office.
5	Great staff, the hygienist was very good, fast, and knowledgeable.  They did not try to up-sale a bunch of unnecessary services. I did not have to wait when I arrived for my appointment and the price was right.
5	Due to insurance changes I had to switch dentists.  Scheduling my appt was easy and I got right in when I arrived.  I did the $29 x-ray, exam, cleaning special, but I plan on coming back in the future.  Everyone there was so friendly and made me feel comfortable.  I love how the dentist took time to address any concerns I had.  They got right to work so I was in and out in under an hour.  Loved it!
