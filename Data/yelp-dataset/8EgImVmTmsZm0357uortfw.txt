1	After shopping at this store for over 8 years, I have overlooked many things like dirty bathrooms and non-functioning glass sliding doors...But I had always thought of it as the local grocery store of choice (there are two other options equidistant from my home in Carefree, AZ...).UNTIL TODAY - I was berated and embarrassed by a cashier who yelled at me that I was breaking the law by having a dog in the store and who refused to load the cart because the 8 pound shih tzu was apparently too ferocious.Needless to say, I left my groceries and have NO intentions of returning.I am all for a gentle reminder of food and safety rules, but I think the cashier was OVER THE TOP...Safeway and Basha's here I come...
4	I took a quick stop here for a few groceries.  I stopped at the Starbucks at the front of the store for an iced coffee then I got my groceries from the produce aisle.  Not a lot of organic produce unfortunately.  The selection was good other than that.  My checker was extremely friendly and nice.  I thought this was a nice store.
4	Prices for food and everything else are a bit too pricey compared to Safeway and Frys's prices. Employees can be rude. Bathrooms aren't ever clean.
