4	I like Qdoba's - it's very convenient to my work, and if you get there before the lunch rush, it's a quick, healthy and tasty lunch.
4	I usually don't write a review on fast food, but I really like Qdoba and their chips.  I really, really like them.  Everything is fresh and quick.  The best part is we got a free lunch (won by my co-worker) for 10 of us yesterday.  How cool.  I will continue to go there and use the rewards card, too.
1	I ate here about a month ago and found a piece of plastic in my burrito. I wouldn't go back.
3	I really wish Yelp! allowed 1/2 stars because I would give this Qdoba location a solid 3.5 stars. This is the best Qdoba Madison has to offer. Of all the times I've dined here, and it has been many, the food has been fast, fresh and correctly made. There is a variety of entrees you can choose from including burritos, nachos,  taco salads and more. I will say they they do skimp on the meat. You have this large burrito that sometimes breaks because they are so full  rice and beans but doesn't include a lot of meat. I often get a chicken burrito with white rice, black beans, pico de gallo, corn salsa, cheese, sour cream, lettuce and cheese queso sauce for an additional $1. Their queso is amazing. I REALLY love it. It brings the burrito all together and has a lot of flavor. This location in particular sits up on a hill and offers a great view busy of Fitchathery Rd. Note: Guacamole is now FREE!!!!!
3	Great news: Guac is now "free".Except all the prices for all the entrees just went up and you get fewer entree points when you use your card.This location is nice and clean. The people working the counter could stand to talk a little more audibly....but the food was fine.
