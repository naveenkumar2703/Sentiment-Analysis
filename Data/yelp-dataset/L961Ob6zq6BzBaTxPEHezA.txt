4	The Pan y Pane Bakery is located inside the Mercado in Guadalupe.  In December we tried the bakery for the frist time, we sent the kids over to get some empanadas.  They were out of pumpkin so he baked some fresh and they were the best I've ever had.  The bread was soft and just the right amount of sweet with the pumkin.  We tried other flavors of empanadas and cochitos - ginger bread pigs and they were all yummy.I went back again yesterday a picked up empanadas and cochitos, the empanadas were as good as I remembered.  One of the cochitos was  nice and soft, one was a little too hard.  This place is very small but it does have out door seating if you'd like.  The owner is super nice and the prices are VERY reasonable!
5	Talk about a hidden gem.  This place makes Guatemalan pastries with an Italian twist.  Simply delicious!  Don't forget to grab yourself one of their amazing coffees.  Say hello to the lovely owners while you're there.
