5	Made appointment very quickly. Bob was extremely professional and courteous. Installed two 4x8 over head storage racks. Very good install. Even vacuumed the entire garage after he was finished. Would definitely recommend.
5	I called them up, and the owner Bob came out to look at my horribly cluttered and dirty garage. He made no judgements, and had great ideas. Gave me an affordable quote and we scheduled it. 4 days later he showed up, working in 108 degree heat. Great attitude, pleasant and did a fantastic job! For the first time in 13 years, we are now parking both of our auto's in our garage! Thank you Bob! I highly recommend this company, as they are honest, ethical and very professional.
5	Great company to help you with your garage storage needs. Bob is easy to work with. Great prices and professional!
