4	I don't like Starbucks. I avoid them if I can. I don't like how they burn their beans (leading to a very bitter coffee), and I don't like how they have turned their back on their sustainable and employee-friendly practices. All that said, this is the only real coffee shop I know of that's walking distance from my grandparents, so I've been coming here off and on for years. As Starbucks go, the espresso drinks are as good as they come from a Starbucks and consistent. They used to charge for Wi-Fi, and I'm happy to report that I'm writing this review on free Wi-Fi now. Their prices do seem a bit high, even for a Starbucks -- over $5 for my Venti Vanilla Latte -- I'm used to only paying those prices at airports. Might be because they don't have any competition. No matter -- I'll be back.
4	What can you really say about starbucks?! Aren't they all the same. Well, basically yes. This one is nice, spacious, has few tables outside that don't feel crammed up together. Service was good and quick. The only reason why I'm reviewing this Sbux is because of the location. I was actually surprised, there were quite a few people inside and atmosphere was pretty nice, for a moment I totally forgot I'm in the Sun City.
5	This is my usual Starbucks; because it's the closest to my house. Have always had a great experience here. Friendly staff; standard Starbucks.
5	This Starbucks is great! Large amount of seating inside and a bit outside under a nice shady tree. Store was clean and staff was nice. It's right along bell, a busy street, however this didn't even phase me as I was inside studying. The store can be busy at times but the wait is never long for a drink and there is always plenty of seating available.
