4	This is my favorite Subway.  I come here maybe once a week and each time the ingredients are fresh and the workers are so happy and pumped when you walk in.  At so many other Subway's i've been to they seem so glum and upset to be there.  I'm so glad this one is in my backyard and so reliable!!
4	What the...I was super impressed by this Subway. I tend to reserve four and five stars for places that really exceed my expectations. And fortunately, because I am addicted to Yelp, I find only the best of the best. But what brought my to Subway was the need to feed. On a hot AZ day I was driving around running errands with friends when suddenly I just had to have some lunch. My friend spotted this Subway and while I first thought that finding another option might be better, I didn't see the point in disagreeing. We walked in and were immediately greeted by three smiling employees eager to take our orders. We wanted the same sandwich, split, so they offered to make two sandwiches but give us the low low price of 1 footlong instead of 2 6 inches. This saved us two bucks!The "sandwich artists" were super funny and it was clear that they had been working here a while. They had a good time slapping the ingredients together and really piling on the toppings. I don't live in the area but if I lived closer, I'd come here just for the service. I left here with a smile on my face and a pretty decent sandwich to boot.
4	It's a Subway... The staff is personable and offers good suggestions. Everything seems as fresh as it can get at a subway.
4	I really like this Subway. I know at times it may seem like "seen one subway, seen 'em all", but I consider myself to be somewhat of a Subway connoisseur since I've eaten at Subway more times and more locations that I can count. This one really stands out. Reasons: Super duper clean, friendly staff, nice decorative touches, and that yummy strawberry lemonade in the soda fountain. What more could you want in a Subway? I'll be here again!
