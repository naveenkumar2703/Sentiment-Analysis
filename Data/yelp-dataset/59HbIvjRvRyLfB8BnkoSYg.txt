4	Cheap (like, really cheap) drinks, great Friday fish fry, and a ton of old guys who will talk to you about really random things or tell you how dumb your tattoos are. The bar special on Fridays is something like 5 or 6 dollars for what seems like 8 pounds of french fries and cod chunks. Fish fry overview: Flaky, tender, cod, with a light batter. Crispy wavy cut fries. Delicious tartar sauce. Average coleslaw. Tasty roll. Bonus: You get a molasses cookie with your meal!Bonus 2: They have amazing pie!On top of the cheap drinks (tYMMV, but my old fashioned was delicious) and tasty fish you also get very attentive wait staff that are all super friendly. I am so glad i live a few blocks from here because I don't know if I would have ever experienced it otherwise. Good stuff!
5	Full disclosure: I am a member of the ladies auxiliary here at post 7591. That being said, the fish fry is delicious. Every third Sunday of the month, between October and June is an omelet breakfast and it's great too.Update: The Fish Fry is every Friday from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. The breakfast is 9 a.m. to noon.
3	The fried cod was fair and the potato was okay. The fries left something to be desired. Overall price was nominal, but a bit high relative to the quality. CAUTION: this place only takes cash; however, there is an ATM on premises. I am sure I will find places that offer better quality fare and accept plastic.
