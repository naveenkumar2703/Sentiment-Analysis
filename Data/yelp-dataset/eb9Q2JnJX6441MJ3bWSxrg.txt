5	The place is conveniently next to the gym. Great place if you are looking to drop off a lot of stuffI popped in one day and decided to find out how much they charged and wow.. Very cheap.  I didn't see any reviews so I only dropped off two of my dress shirts.  The gal there told me to come back the next day after 3pm.  FAST.  I came back and my shirts were clean and pressed.  Nothing wrong with any of my shirts.  I asked her if they did the pressing themselves, but they said that it was sent off to another place.  For the price, I didn't care.  Side note, they do alterations as well
5	Price for cleaning is awesome, 3 shirts and a pair of pants was under 10 bucks, AAAAAND its ready the next day, the place I went to in the past used to charge a little extra for that. Awesome.
