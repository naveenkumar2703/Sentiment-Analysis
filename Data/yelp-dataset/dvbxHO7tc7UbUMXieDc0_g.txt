1	BE CAREFUL!!!!Even though you are walking into a Lens Crafters store to get treatment from Dr. Irene, you are not dealing with Lens Crafters.  I went to Dr. Irene's office to get contact lenses, and I was told on the telephone that it would only cost me $15 for the exam (my insurance co-payment).But it turns out that you have to spend an additional $60 to get a prescription!  This is a RIP OFF!  Why would my insurance pay for an exam that doesn't include a prescription?!?The doctor was nice, I guess...but I couldn't think of anything else except for the way I was getting ripped off.  It would be MUCH CHEAPER to go to an optometrist that wasn't located in a mall.  Seriously.
4	This place was just fine, as far as optometrists go.  The receptionists and assistants were friendly, and the Dr was nice.  In and out promptly with a prescription for only my $20 co-pay.  No insurance hassle, or up-sell for glasses at Lenscrafters.
5	I've been going here for 3 years now. Never had any complaints and they are always fast and to the point. Great place!
