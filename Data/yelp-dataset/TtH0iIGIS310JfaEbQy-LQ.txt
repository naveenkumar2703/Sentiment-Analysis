4	Nice and clean little cafe, perfect for breakfast.
4	This place is awesome, especially when I don't feel like racing to the commisarry, fast food or chow hall! Give yourself 15 minutes though, everything is cooked to order.Use the services on base! They'll disappear if you don't!
5	The breakfast here was so delicious!  The burritos and breakfast biscuits  were to die for!  As you can see I'm using past tense, since they no longer serve breakfast here!  :( so disappointing!
