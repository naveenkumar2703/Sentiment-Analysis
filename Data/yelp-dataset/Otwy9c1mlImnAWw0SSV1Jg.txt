3	Trust me, I am not a fan of Arco gas. If my group of friends didn't rent a car, i wouldnt have come here for the cheap gas. The price of gas was decent but not much of a deal considering the gas price you would expect in Vegas. But ehhh the gas got us back to Los Angeles just fine and the rental is back at the rental place.
1	This place is so lame!! Why in the world can't you pay at the pump?! As a girl getting gas after work at night I want to stay as close to my car as possible that and you have to pay .34 to use you're debit card. I am not coming back here it's not worth being a little cheaper.
