4	This is some of THE best pizza i've ever had.Its decently priced, around 7$ for a full large one topping pizza, its perfect for a night after partying when you just need something to eat.
3	I used to get pizza from here all the time, but recently I've found Twice the Deal to be a better pizza place. Bianca's offers the same things as Twice the Deal but at a slightly higher cost (also, no dip). The only thing I like better about Bianca's is their large juicy tomato slices.
4	Looking for a good pizza at a great price?  Look no farther than Bianca's Pizza.Bianca's is close to where I work and I have always found the pizza to be consistently good... but the prices are even better: you can get a large three-topping pizza for pick-up for just $9.99 plus applicable taxes!  The pizza is always made hot and fresh, and they don't skimp on the toppings either.I definitely recommend Bianca's Pizza if you are looking for pizza in the area.
4	$7 large pizza? It's a no-brainer.If you're looking for cheap, good pizza near the universities, this is where you should go. I used to order from here all the time when I lived around King and Columbia. I miss it.
