4	Very nice and clean. At the top of every hour you have to get out! This is awesome in my opinion reapply sunblock or go to the bathroom for kids! ;)
4	I take my son here for swimming lessons.  If you are a Mesa resident then lessons are only $22 for 6 weeks!  The aquatic center is huge.  The lessons are held in the kid's pool area where the water slide is.  There's a really shallow play area too.  They also have a diving pool that is 13 feet deep and and olympic size pool for laps.  They have a grand stand for watching events and a picnic area and shaded areas for lounge chairs.  There is really something for everyone at this pool.
4	My daughter and I love this place.  She takes swim lessons there and the staff is so nice and encouraging to her.  I wish I could remember their names so I could call them out but Justin is the only one I remember.  He was super great but all of the others are, too.  It's clean and reasonably priced.  I just wish they had more sun chairs for the parents to use while the kids are having fun.
