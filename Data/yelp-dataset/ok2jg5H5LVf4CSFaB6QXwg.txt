4	For her 21st, a friend of mine used Ever So Sweet to provide cupcakes. The cupcakes ranged from tiny to huge and in various colours, with all looking far too good to eat. But of course we ate them all up and they were delicious. The only negative point was the icing had gone a little hard on top which makes me feel like they weren't 100% fresh. Still delicious though.
5	WOWThis place delivers. They make the most delicious cupcakes I've ever had the pleasure of eating, so soft and moist in the centre yet really cakey. If that makes sense?!They have amazing frosting (which tastes amazing) and patterns, they go all out for whatever you want. Cupcakes!! Brilliant!!!I definitely know who i'm calling when i'm having a party
2	Since when did cupcakes become trendy? In a sort of ironic manner, girls in their teens and 20s have been cooing over these glitter filled treats for a couple of years now. It doesn't seem to me however, that they're doing it for the taste, as these glittery, brightly coloured conceptions can rarely even compete with the cheapest of Greggs' donuts in a taste test. It looks more to me like these hormonal young ladies want to act out some schoolgirl roleplay fantasy and look quirky, saucy, or any suitable adjective that will bag them a chisel jawed hunk. Failing that, anyone with a penis and an air of desperation will do.Massively annnoying.
