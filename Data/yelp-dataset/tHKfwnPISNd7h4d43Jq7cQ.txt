3	First off, this campus is GIGANTIC. I literally could not tell it apart from the surrounding college buildings. The school is huge and the campus itself is very modern- bathrooms consistently clean and very big, lots of technology available for teacher and student use, and a strong admin presence at this campus.Per their rankings/scores, this school does fairly well- better than average, at the very least. Teachers with CCSD undergo a lot of training and are provided with many tools to succeed, and are open to meeting with parents and discussing anything that make arise as a problem on campus or in their classrooms.
5	No better band program with almost 90% of it all financially funded by the people!
