1	Disappointing! Not a word of "Hello" or "Welcome" upon entering. Time spent on hair was SILENT. I have never met a hair dresser with "nothing to say or ask". Hair style was not as requested. Didn't know a regular braid from a French braid :(( Worst professionalism I have ever experienced. Amazing in an industry based on repeat costumers and referral based growth. Hair was NOT done by owner, but a gal he rents space to.
5	Go to Jeni! She is the best. Meticulous, and I always leave with exactly what I wanted.
5	I drove by this salon after having a mani/pedi and decided to call, I wanted a hair cut and was hoping I could get in same day. I spoke to Anthony who told me he could get me in around 2. So I had a couple of hours to wait but I was fine with that since it was so last minute.  I was really happy because when I want a haircut I want a haircut now! I got there a bit early  was greeted by Anthony who was finishing up with his client.  I was happy to see that the woman he was working on hair looked great!He promptly sat me down in the chair we discussed what I wanted and 30 minutes later VOILA!  I got the best haircut I've ever had. He blew my hair dry, had me stand up so he could cut it in the back and sides to get it just perfect and it is so cute. Normally I run home and wash it and re-do it or I just leave with it wet, this was the first time I was able to go shopping directly after my cut!  I can't believe I've finally found a great stylist and he's in my back yard!
5	I've been getting a haircut from Anthony for about five years and he always cuts exactly how I want or better. I work in sales and I always want to look my best. I have not had luck finding a Men's hair stylist I would regularly return to. Now I only go to Salon Virtu. Quick, consistent, and great service. I would definitely recommend.
