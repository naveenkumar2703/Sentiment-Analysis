4	A little understaffed but still a Starbucks, good stuff
4	It's a target Starbucks always understaff and slow but it's one of the only ones in the area so it's not a bad place to go
1	What's the point of having a Starbucks if it doesn't open till after 8am?!?! Most people are already at work by then..
