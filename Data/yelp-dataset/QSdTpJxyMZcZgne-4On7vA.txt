1	Food court location at Arrowhead mall.  Way overpriced for what they serve.  1 slice, 1 side (very small potatoes), and 1 drink was around $7and that's a meal combo "deal".  I know it's the mall, but I can do a lot better for $7.  It was very unappealing to see them carefully weigh the side portion of potatoes - OMG don't accidentally give me one potato chunk too many! loss of profits!!Service was rather friendly on my visit, and perhaps it was because someone seeming to be in a managerial role was working "the line". Probably everyone has had a slice of sbarro and there's nothing special to write home about.  Side potatoes were a little too oily.  Mall crowd is lame, even though I admit I'm part of the crowd if I'm there.I'm still miffed about the $7 "deal".  I'll go to a local place next time.
2	I find the prices to be too high for the quality of the food. It really doesn't taste that great, especially the pizza. There aren't many places I like to eat in the mall so I only come here if I'm hungry enough.
3	I think Sbarro has good pizza, but everybody knows that it is way too expensive and you can find better pizza at a better price elsewhere. Although sometimes it is convenient for when you are shopping at the mall and can't be bothered to venture elsewhere. And on those occasions I do find that their pepperoni pizza is pretty awesome!
