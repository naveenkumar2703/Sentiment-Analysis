5	I had purchased a Laptop from their Gilbert store.  Took it in to this store, because I had questions about operating the laptop.  My questions were answered quickly and correctly, and there was no charge.  A year later, the laptop got a severe virus.  Took it in, got diagnosis, was quoted a price for repairs.  Two days later I had the laptop back in operation.  These guys are pros, and honest.
5	These Guys are Great from the top on down!If you have a question they will answer it. Whether online or in thier store!Best wishes for your continued success!
5	Unfortunately, had to take my laptop in for spyware removal for the second time.  Once again, Data Doctors performed a complete repair/cleaning of the system.  Service is professional and knowledgeable.  Turn-around time amazing.   I trust these guys 100%.
4	Where do you go when you want to date a doctor? Data Doctors!No but actually they are really friendly and helpful.
1	Was quoted $59 + $99 labor for a $39 replacement keyboard. All I needed was one key replaced. Replacement key and retainer clip found elsewhere online new for $6.99 delivered.
