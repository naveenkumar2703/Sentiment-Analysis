4	Stopped in here yesterday to grab my Husband a cigar.The guy inside was very helpful and knew what he was talking about.After his suggestion I decided on a $20 triple infused Cognac cigar,and another little Java flavored one.My Husband Loved it! I Even took and few puffs, and it was sweet and smooth just like my Hunny!!
5	I was in town staying at the Kierland with the family and needed to find a good cigar. Found Hemmingways on Yelp and walked over to check it out. Very nice selection of cigars and a low key vibe. I selected one of their house brand cigars and it was actually one off the best cigars I've ever smoked. Easy draw, mild to medium body and overall very smooth. Now only if they had room for a little lounge...
