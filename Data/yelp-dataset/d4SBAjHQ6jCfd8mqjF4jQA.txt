4	Good location (on a corner), so easy to access.  The coffee is kept up and full day or night, simple grocery items and the fuel prices are competitive.  It is not a Full-Service Gas Station but they have Motor Oil and Radiator Fluid if your BMW or Jaguar is running low...lol  and sometimes the pumps are out of order, so I give it four stars.  Right around the corner from Duck and Decanter and a Starshmuck's.  Access to Hwy 51 is two blocks off in distance.
2	That men's restroom is sooooo PISSY and NASTY!!! I'm gagging as I reminisce on the bind I was in when I went in to drain the lizard! After which, I get the 34oz soda and have to wait 6 minutes to check out because there is only ONE cashier assisting and he has lines on both sides of his register while the other two associates in the store find it more important to stock bananas and chips!!!! I will take my business to 16th street where I know what kinda service to expect!
4	I usually hit this Quik Trip when I'm in Phoenix and need an icy beverage on a 120 degree day. I love their soda fountain because they have different types of ice cubes (crushed, big cubes, etc) and a great selection of sodas made with filtered water. They also have a self-serve milkshake machine and lots of flavored coffee options if you are into that sort of thing. The selection of snacks is good but it's the drink varieties that keep me coming back for more. Decent gas prices too.
