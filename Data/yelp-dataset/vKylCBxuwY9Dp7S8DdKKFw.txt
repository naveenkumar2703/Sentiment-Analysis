5	I was researching  to have professional photos taken of me. I was not taking these pictures for a loved one or honey but instead, for me.   It was important  that the moment in time was captured.  In addition, I felt that the pictures should reflect who I am with sense of creativeness through art photography.  Then I came across Pamela Nicole, Femme Art Boudoir.  There was no doubt in my mind when I saw her website that this was the person who would capture the beauty.  When setting up the appointment, at no point did I feel nervous of what the outcome would be.  Pamela had  high professionalism along with understanding my wants and needs.   During the day of the shoot, I left the creativity in her hands as she snapped away her camera.  When I got the final pictures, I truly had a verklempt (Yiddish for overcome with emotion) moment. I will cherish these pictures as well as, a friendship I had cultivated with Pamela.  She has also taken portraits of my daughter, in high school.   In the future, I will have a family portrait.  We are just waiting for the removal of braces, for my son.  I honestly believe that there needs to be a connect with you and the photographer and that connection was made.  My deepest thank you, Pamela!
5	I had an amazing experience with Femme Art Boudior! Pamela was so kind and professional through out the entire process. Initially I was very nervous, but Pamela gave great instruction which helped me relax. The hair & make-up artist, Linda, did an amazing job and ensured that not a hair was out of place during the entire shoot. The pictures turned out so lovely and was everything that I had hoped they would be. I would recommend Femme Art Boudior to any woman!
