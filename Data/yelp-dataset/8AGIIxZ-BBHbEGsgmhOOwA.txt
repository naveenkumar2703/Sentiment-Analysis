1	The worst Arby's I have ever eaten at. If you want a good one, visit the one on Park. So, here is why it is bad.1) the portions are small on every sandwich that we ordered. Four different sandwiches. This is compared to other Arby's I've eaten at.2) they say they don't have any monthly deals. I was told they belong to the same owner as the one on Park and they have monthly deals.3) tried it twice and both times they messed up our order. We paid but did not get things.4) their customer service is awfulI don't expect much in life but when I go somewhere to give them my money , I expect better than what I got here.
1	This place is pretty gross.  It's dirty.  The gas station it's attached to need a massive overhaul.  The employees are sketchy-looking at best.  Have some standards, Arby's.
