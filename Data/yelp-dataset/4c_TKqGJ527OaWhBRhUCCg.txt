4	The best thing about Circus Circus where this Subway is located.
1	Do not eat here!This is a rip off!Not a typical subway!Expensive!  More expensive than usual subways!Jacked up prices!Long lines to pay double or triple the usual subway bill.I can find a thousand better and cheaper places in Vegas.  Even if plowed under, you could manage better!  There is a McDonalds next door that has typical McD's prices. Go there.Stay away!
1	Super expensive..  Nothing special about this "circus circus" location, if you are used to Subway. Giving one star due to the $$$$, holy cow, highway robbery, just wrong.!!!!  $29 for 2-foot longs, 1-six inch and a drink...
