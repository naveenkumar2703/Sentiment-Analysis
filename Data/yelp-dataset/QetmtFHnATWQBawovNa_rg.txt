3	so far so good, staff wont give out the gate code to residents, they dont seem very helpful. The apartment itself is really nice and the price is good for its location. Hopefully it will get better.
4	I lived at parkside with a roommate back in 2011 - 2012 and I loved it.Debby in the office was part of the reason why she is so sweet I just adore her!We had no problems while living there, if there was a maintenance problem they came right away. The apartments were quiet, safe and clean. The pool was very nice and never crowded, also had comfy pool lounge chairs. Our oven was weird the temperature setting seemed to be off but a cheapy store bought internal thermometer fixed that problem!I would recommend parkside to anyone.. families, young people, couples It seems to be fit for all.
