4	Thank god for Starbucks at 5:30am.  =)I was on my way into work and was in dire need of a wake me up and some breakfast.  I stopped in hoping on a Saturday Starbucks was open and sure enough I was saved.  I got a Venti Caramel Macchiato and a piece of coffee cake.  Both items were exactly what I needed to get me going this morning and keep me awake through my workday.  Starbucks you saved me once again.
2	Starbucks was having a happy hour promotion for about 10 days recently, where between 3-5PM you could get half price frappucinos.  I (or my wife) went four times over the promotion.  75% of the time our order was screwed up in some way, shape or form (whip when no whip was requested, caramel flavor when should have been coffee, venti when it should have been grande, etc.).  The drinks still tasted good, but dag, that is a pretty poor success rate.  Service was (and usually) is pretty friendly at least.  Now the question...if I want a caramel/coffee ice blended drink...who am I going to choose, McD's or Starbucks...
4	This Starbucks is located inside the Safeway on 19th Ave. They made my order correctly and it was the late afternoon pick me up I needed. No complaints as you know exactly what you're going to get when you go to a Starbucks.
