5	Hoyt's Kajukenbo is awesome!  All three of my kids attend various classes at Hoyt's.  We have been training there for almost 2 years.  The students really have to earn their promotions and work hard, though a lot feels like play.  They are learning more than just martial arts, they learn respect, discipline, honor, self esteem, and more.  I honestly can't say enough good things about Hoyt's Kajukenbo.  Sifu Greg is amazing.  He knows how to get results while keeping everyone loving him.

5	Hoyt's Kajukenbo offers a great martial arts curriculum along with a family like environment for all students and supporters. Sifu Greg is a patient man and one to be greatly respected due to his vast knowledge and experience in training the art of Kajukenbo. The promotions are earned through hard-work and dedication, something that not many places offer nowadays, unless you chalk up the money. The full contact training prepares one for the realism that comes in actual street fights and other scenarios. If you want a place that doesn't teach a false sense of security, Hoyt's is the place to be.
