3	small change can be a good place for bargains but searching through the racks of poorly inspected merchandise leaves alot to be desired. The store is quite smelly and the staff is very uncaring and usually are too busy talking to each other. I must also add they have a great selection of furniture and baby necessities
2	I went one time for maternity clothes, though I was pretty disappointed in their maternity selection.  I'll echo other reviewers' experiences with the staff - they're pretty uninterested in the customers.  Personally, I don't like overbearing, hovering staff, but they were a little too hands-off.  It didn't matter, though.  The maternity clothes were about as awful as anywhere.  The selection was pretty poor - and who is wearing those itty-bitty short things?  Tiny Scottsdale women who barely have a bump?  Maybe I should have made a few more visits.  I managed to find 2 shirts at OK prices.
