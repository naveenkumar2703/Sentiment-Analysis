4	I wanted to buy a membership for roadside assistance for my daughter for her birthday (late) to help keep her safe when she drives around with the babies and this was the closest office to her so we drove over here today to take care of it.  There was only a mimnimal  wait between when we were greeted on arrival to when the rep came out to talk to us and sign her up.  Fast, easy, courteous and efficient.  In and out.  No problemo.  I will recommended, as always, a membership to this fine organization.  They have saved me and other family members numerous times over the years.  They cover you not only in your own car but in any car you are riding in.  I've been a member for nearly 50 years as were my parents before me.  Do it.
5	Quick and easy.  My husband and I stopped in here.  We told the person where we'd like to go and she gave us all these maps and books to help us plan our trip.Woo hoo!!!   Quick and easy!
5	Free Passport Photos!!!!  Awesome!!
5	Once a AAA member, always a AAA member. Debby White set me up with my membership about a month ago and boy am I glad she talked me into it! She's great. Not even a month after I got my AAA Plus membership....I ran over a huge nail, got a flat and had to use one of my service calls. Then I had to get my water pump replaced 2 weeks later and it was dirt cheap at AAA compared to other auto service shops. And I got a 10% member discount and a warranty! I have this involuntary compulsive impulse and I ask "do you offer AAA discounts" everywhere I go now. Debby is always really really really helpful when I come in. So far, as of today, the mechanics *seem* trustworthy and honest.  I love this location and I'm pleased with my membership. I will be renewing my membership every year because it is an absolute must have in my opinion. My membership has damn near paid for itself at this point. This place gets the ultimate stamp of approval!
