3	Evil...seductive...enticing...yummy sweet vendors. No matter how overpriced the per 100g cost, a huge table of childhood reminiscent sweets always forces me to part with my pennies.Smack bang in the middle of the St James centre lies this tempting table of 'spice' as my Grandad calls them. Great for a quick treat as you shop.

And your stomach would jump with glee if it could.Tempting tempting tempting stall in St James centre and if you are lacking sugar then head for your candy fix. Forget another top or a new accessory all you really desire are sweets so who are you kidding anyway when you think it's a bit pricey (it is) you will devour the bag of goodness in 3 minutes flat anyway and look longingly at the sweet vendor which is calling out to you, to get just another little bag to treat yourself for your hard day of shopping.
4	Another stall located in St. James Shopping Centre, Sweet Mountains is home to one of the tastiest looking pick 'n' mixes I've ever seen. They have it all here;-cola bottles-gummy smurfs-jelly snakes-flying saucers-Liquorice Allsorts (the beady ones, of course)-milk bottles-strawberry laces-Haribo strawberries-chocolate buttons...A selection for every taste bud and for all ages too. Excellent if you're looking for a sugar rush while doing a bit of retail therapy.
