5	Our neighbors found signs of termites. They suggested we check our home. Sure enough, termites. We all went to the Bug & Weed Mart  and the staff was EXTREMELY helpful. Jim talked us through exactly how to treat each property for termites; he explained and drew it out. The cost for each home was about $160, significantly less than the $750+ an extermination company proposed. Research showed exterminators dilute solutions significantly more than recommended, rendering treatment ineffective. It took a day of work, but we teamed up and did the work and together spent $320 instead of $1500+. It is now 8 months later and no signs of termites. We are confident treatment will last at least the 10 years Jim told us. We highly recommend Bug & Weed Mart; they truly are informed, knowledgeable and EXPERTS!
5	Discovered this store after searching for how to treat for scorpions. When we went to the store Jim was very helpful and took his time explaining the treatment procedure. Prices were very reasonable. Best of all, I only had a few lingering scorpions after treating and once I eliminated those manually I haven't seen any since. Can't more strongly recommend and I will make return visits as necessary.FYI...they have a nice sign that faces Ray Rd however they are tucked away in a back corner of the plaza
5	Same issue as "DE" had. I had two companies out that wanted to charge me over $700 to treat for termites. I forgot the man's name at the store, but he was very helpful knowledgeable and the prices were good. Hopefully the termite treatment that I applied from these guys will work for years to come.
