5	This place is great! I hate going to the dentist but they make it very comfortable - the staff is terrific, organized and the establishment is very clean, (and tastefully decorated!).
5	Dr Cynthia is great they are super timely I'm never waiting more than 5 minutes in the waiting room! I went to then because the great review about kids. I took my 2 yr old and she loves it. She always wants to come back for her turn. I'm glad they gave her a good experience as opposed to my hatred and fear I felt growing up. The staff here is very friendly and always remembers who you are. We still go here even now that we moved across the valley! Also they never make you feel bad for having unhealthy teeth. Come here if you want a friendly atmosphere!
5	I absolutely adore TLC staff and especially Dr. Cynthia Gregory.  What a great experience I always have.  My family and I have been patients before Dr. Gregory came, but we love and trust her.  She is always pleasant, cheery and remembers her clients!  I recommend her to ALL my friends!
