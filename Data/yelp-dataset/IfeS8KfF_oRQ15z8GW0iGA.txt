4	My wife and i really enjoy the friendly staff of this shop and the massive selection of hookahs and shisha flavors....if you smoke hookah or just wanna see a cool shop in north las vegas id stop by and say hi =)
5	The people who work at this smoke shop are very friendly always a smile.
4	I have no clue why I am reviewing a smoke shop.  I use to come here at least 3 times per week because I was once a heavy smoker.  The people that work here are always pretty cool and they know their regulars.  As soon as I walk in, they already have my cigarrettes waiting for me.  Hopefully this place will not see me anymore because I am trying to give up smoking. My goal..to become a social smoker.  I know that sounds bad, but baby steps.  Place is cheap and staff is always friendly/knowledgeable.
2	Why are there kids bicycles outside the smoke shops? If you walk inside you'll notice pipes and bongs everywhere...is this what we need in our neighborhoods? We should put smoke shops, pawn shops, check cashing stores, title loan places away from residential areas.  These smoke shops are all Indian people from the Mideast...are these guys the experts or what????? Lol
