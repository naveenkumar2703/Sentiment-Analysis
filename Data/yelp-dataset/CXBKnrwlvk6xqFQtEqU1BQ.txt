4	Shopped here for a battery when it conked out from the AZ heat and when I needed a tail light bulb the other day.  The employees are helpful and you get in and out quick.
5	I visited O'Reilly's this afternoon after noticing my headlight was out. Jared, the gentleman who greeted me as soon as I walked in the door, was more than helpful. I told him my headlight was out and he immediately found the bulb I needed. Not only did he help me find the right bulb, but he volunteered to replace it for me, showed me how to replace it, and also gave me a few tips on how to make the bulbs last longer. I couldn't have asked for better service! After such an impressive experience today, I intend to make all of my future car-related purchases at O'Reilly's.
3	Across the street from Autozone.  If you're too lazy to cross the street this this is your answer.  These stores are a mirror image.  Can two stores sell enough wiper fluid to stay in business?
