3	Good neighborhood convenient store. It's got the basics, and it's nice for a late-night Oreo run! They have Mexican coke which is awesome. I'm usually the only white person in the store but whatevs.
3	Appearance wise, Kwik Mart looks ghetto. It's your typical off-the-main-street convenience store and carries your essentials. It's within walking distance from my girlfriend's house, though I don't suggest we walk there. The staff is nice every time and a good overall selection of items. No reason to stop going!
4	.....the closest stop to my home just so happens to have the cheapest gas in Northern Phoenix.  2 minutes from door to door - what more can you ask??
