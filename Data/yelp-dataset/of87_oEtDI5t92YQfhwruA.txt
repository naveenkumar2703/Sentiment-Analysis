1	Called to schedule a rental and was told one was available. Was called 30 minutes later to be told there was nothing available. When I called the next closest location they told me they couldn't pick me up because there was a closer location. I got the run around from both of these locations. Went back to my usual location. Although farther away, they are much more dependable.
5	I had a wonderful car rental experience at the Enterprise location at 9210 N. Cave Creek Road.  They had a person come to the car repair shop to pick me up on time. Also, I am ever so grateful that when it came time for me to return this super cute and efficient with gas mileage car rental that this rental location was kept open for me for few minutes after their business hours.  I needed a few extra minutes of driving time to get to their location and Brian (Enterprise representative) was super nice and stayed at the location waiting for me (even though he had been at this Enterprise location from 7AM and it was a day before a major holiday)!  Wow!  Thank you for your great service and kindness.
5	I rent cars fairly regularly for business and personal use, and I love the friendliness of the Sunnyslope location. Everyone from the drivers to the front desk are extremely courteous and professional every time I'm here.
