3	Yelp 100 Challenge 2013- 12/100Came up here to celebrate a friends birthday this past Friday evening. The park is nicely located next to Lone Mountain (hence the name.. duh).  This park offers ample picnic space that is covered, Tennis Ball Courts, Horseshoe Courts, large play area for kids, and bocce ball courts. The only thing that was a slight disappointment was that by the time the sun went down, the play area was not lit up. We searched for lighting and didn't find any switches to light up the play area for my nieces. We enjoyed a few rounds of Bocce Ball and I will return solely for that-- Make sure you BYOB (bring your own bocce balls)
4	I'm new to hiking & I hike this mountain frequently with a group.  It doesn't look like much, but if you go straight up the face of the mountain, it's a challenging climb. It always kicks my ass & did so once again. One day, I will conquer it without feeling defeated.It's a great hike to do if your short on time. It takes about 2 hrs if you climb at a moderate pace.
