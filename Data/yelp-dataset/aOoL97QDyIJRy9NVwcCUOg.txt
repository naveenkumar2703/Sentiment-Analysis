4	Great service great prices.  A real family shop!
2	Had a pair of pants taken in and caught my heel on the hem so half of it needed to be sewn. $18 for the alteration and $5 for the hem (really a few stitiches?). Told me they would be ready on Wednesday (dropped off on Sat) didn't make it there until Friday, could I come back after 5? How hard is is to call and let me know. Returned on Sat. They were linen, would it have been to much to press?
1	I took a $228 pair of Citizens for Humanity jeans in to K-Family to be hemmed. Despite the obvious quality of the garment and my expressed concern about the stylized appearance of the jean that would be compromised by the hem, they handled the job carelessly, hemming and rehemming it too short -- two times -- and leaving the messy stitching where it had been artful. I feel sick. You get what you pay for here, a quick job, no art.
