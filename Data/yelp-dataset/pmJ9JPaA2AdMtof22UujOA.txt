4	This is my second run on this river mountain trail.  The first time I went was on a weekday and I was the only one on the trail.  I ran up most of the trail. This time, my wife and I went on Thanksgiving morning and there were a few others walking the trail.  It's a moderate 3 mile run to the top.  Once up there the view is quite scenic.  You see Lake Mead on one side and the City of Las Vegas in the distance on the other side.  It was a very pleasant workout trip not too far from home.
5	I like bootleg. It's not too far from my home in Boulder City.We take the boy scout trail that leads to an over look of the city and lake mead. It's truly awesome to know that serenity and nature is right in our back yard. The only thing that can get a little weird/challenging is that for the first half of the hike,bikes are also allowed on the trail. You can get mowed down pretty easily if both parties aren't careful.
