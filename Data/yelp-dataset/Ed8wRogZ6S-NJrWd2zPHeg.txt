1	A friend and I go to McCarran Airport. He gets dropped off at Southwest; I'm going to Virgin. Me: I'll just get off here too.Driver: Naw, it's in the next terminal.Me: I don't mind. I've got plenty of time.Driver: Naw, I'll just take you right up there.Me: Well ... OK.Driver: (drives around the whole airport, racks up $7 extra fare)Me: What the hell?! I would have gotten out if you told me you were going to do THAT. Now I'm pissed. By the way, what's this $3 'voucher charge'?Driver: uh, that's from the company.Me: It's not anything to do with the credit card machine?Driver: No, the only way is to accept it.Me: I don't accept it.Driver: ...Me (calls cab company and complains)Cab company: Sorry, we didn't do anything wrong, and by the way, that voucher fee actually was a credit card fee.Me: (files chargeback with credit card company for the entire cab fare)Good job! Everybody walks away happy!
1	From the airport, you don't have much choice in which cab you get into, taxi stand directs you and you are stuck with the can that shows up.Our driver was friendly, as he took the double-secret double-long way to our hotel. Complaint filed with the taxi bureau. Hope the extra $12 he got from us is worth the day he'll have to spend there explaining.$3 fee to use a credit card, with no advance warning on the machine. Nice. Won't be using them again if possible.
1	Choose a different cab company. They add $3 automatically when you use a credit card. Classy. The cab also dropped me and my four bags off 50 ft. from the curb because it was more convenient for him than pulling up to the curb and risking getting blocked in.
