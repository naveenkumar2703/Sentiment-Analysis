5	I am just back from my third FUSION CEO-CIO Symposium at Fluno. Unfortunately you can't get in there unless you are attending a conference. The food, service and rooms are so good it is worth finding a conference you can register for just for the experience. Everyone raved about the food, and today when the conference overflowed the first floor seating, the staff moved a few of us upstairs, brought cutlery and drinks, came by a few minutes later with a tray of their excellent desserts which generally overwhelmed the will power of most attendees. Also excellent wines in the pub at the dinner in the evening.Wireless everywhere and the auditorium has all the latest tech for speakers and wireless and electrical outlets on the desk extending around the room. This is the best conference facility -- auditorium, hotel rooms and food -- that I have experienced.8th floor has a "study pub" open from 4 to 11 with a bar and pool table and, I saw on the wall plaque, an exercise facility. The restaurant area seats about 75, I think -- great food, great service and great wines.
