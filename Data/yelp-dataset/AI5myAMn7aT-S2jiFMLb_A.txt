5	It is easy to brag about Steve Jarosh at MidFirst Bank. He is the Vice President/East Valley Business Banking Manager. Steve understands how important it is that  business owners and commercial real estate investors be able to have access to the financing they need to fuel the flames of their business visions.Four top reasons I recommend Steve: ~ Service minded and business acumen ~ He can help you borrow up to $10 Million ~ MidFirst is Financially sound (not all banks are, as you know) ~ Strong SBA lender
5	A+++ Customer service. I am always greeted with smiles, and on a hot day a bottle of water. Here this bank is going over the top with genuine friendly customer service, and other banks are now charging you to walk in the door to make transactions. I have a personal banker! Yeah, that is correct! I am not a millionaire by any means, but MidFirst Bank makes me feel like one. Heidi is a wonderful and friendly person. She came to my office to introduce herself and drop off some banking information. Do yourself a favor, and drop that BIG BANK! This is a big bank with hometown values and feel! LOVE LOVE LOVE!
4	Very friendly and approachable!I Just LOVE going into just about any Mid-First location, but this was great.They treated me like a king, and helped me with my debit card issues in a thorough, effective manner.  Parking can be difficult, as it is in the middle of downtown, but if I already have other business there, such a pleasure to stop by!Thank you, Mid-First!
