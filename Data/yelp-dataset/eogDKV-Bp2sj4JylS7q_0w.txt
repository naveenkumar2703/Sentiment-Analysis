5	HONEST, fast and I'll be going back.  I went in today to get my headlight replaced (I thought I had a bulb out).  I had called a couple of places and this was convenient and had the best price (besides doing it myself).  Took it in, guy comes back a few minutes later... the wiring cable had come loose.  No charge.  Great service!
1	Showed up to get oil change. One car in garage and two open bays. Informed it will be over 30 minutes before they can even get my car in.
5	It was my first time going there yesterday and I will continue going there from now on! They were super fast and got me in right away, it only took about 15-20 minutes. Not only did they change my oil, but they vacuumed my car and cleaned the windows! The service was great, I think his name was Bill, and he was very personable and nice! I would recommend going here!
5	In and out in 15 minutes over my lunch break. Got the bare bones "value" oil change for $25; they didn't haggle or try to excessively up sell me. Very nice!
