2	I have a friend who insists we eat here when we get together. Sometimes he wins, sometimes I do. Arby's reminds me of the Roy Roger's chain, which I believe they bought a few decades ago, but without the cowboy stuff. The food is not bad now that they have updated their menus. But the old beef sandwiches which I do not believe either Geno's nor Pat's would serve in Philly is still on the menu. Ugh. Somethings do take a while to die I guess. I also need to get new friends. I'm feeling generous today, so I'll give them two stars for the new menu.
3	Received a coupon in the mail for a BOGO Beef & Cheddar Sandwich....so I dropped by this location to grab a bite.  I was starving when I arrived, so I over-ordered.  In addition to my 2 Beef & Cheddars, I ordered a Roast Chicken Club Sandwich and a Curly Fries....damn, there goes the diet!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/x0y6TU_03x7ZOjzKCiekkQ?select=8o1nt_uBhuouxxMs_yctaQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/x0y6TU_03x7ZOjzKCiekkQ?select=mNSs2QGULi0WF2mFyc5pyQThe Beef & Cheddars were ok.  The Roast Chicken Club was very good.  Of course, their Curly Fries are one of their signature items....and was solid.The kids working at this place were very friendly and were working hard to  keep the restaurant clean. I could hear them in the back talking about how to properly mop the floor and wipe down the tables.....sometimes the current generation gets it right.Return Factor - 75%
1	Amon the crappiest of all Arby's, stale bread, poorly made sandwiches and unfriendly service.
2	Worst Arby's I've been to, staff always out by the drive through smoking and chatting with friends, then act put out when you ask them to make a sandwich.
1	Just went to this restaurant around 5PM on  9/28/13... stood around for a few minutes pacing the register area and saw no employees. No one at the front register, drive-thru or cook stations. This place is always dead. Perhaps if there were people that actually worked, they'd have more patrons. So disappointed as I really wanted some chicken tenders :(
1	This place will make you *sick*.  Although they close at 9PM, the kitchen is completely shut down at 8:15, and they're serving cold remains from under the counter. The Au Jus for our French dip sandwiches was lukewarm and foamy with congealed fat -- not above the 140 degrees required for safe food.  When we returned to complain, there was an employee in street clothes with a chair pulled up to the cash register (from the restaurant side) eating a meal.  The manager said it was the first time *that day* someone had complained about this kind of problem.
