1	Pinnacle At Towne Center raised rent $200 per month our second year living in the complex.
4	I've been living here for about 3 months now, and everything has been great - no complaints. The apartment is nice - aside from the tiny washer/dryer, everything is perfect. The 3-story layout is nice to keep the noise down - you can occasionally hear neighbors if their TV or music is up too loud, but since the bedroom is on the 3rd floor, noise from the neighbor's 2nd floor is never a problem.The fitness center has got a nice selection of machines and weights. The pool area is a nice place to relax. The business center has helped me out when I needed a late-night photocopy.The office is open until 6 (7 on Thursdays), so that's convenient. And the couple times I needed to put in a maintenance request, it was easy to book online, and they were taken care of the next day - no hassle at all.
2	Don't let online pictures fool you! I was looking for an apartment in the area& looked here because it's a very convenient location. This community looks attractive until you visit and look a little closer. The buildings are in poor condition and the inside of what we saw is even worse. Very outdated, odd color of counter tops, very cheap cabinets, stucco appeared to have water damage, and just an over all very cheap looking place. For the price they are asking there are several better options in the area. 2 stars for the friendly staff who I imagine have to hustle to get people to move in.
