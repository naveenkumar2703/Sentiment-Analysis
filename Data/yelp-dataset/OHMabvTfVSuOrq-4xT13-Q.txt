5	I was referred to Dr. Alice Chen for my 20 month old son.  And what a great referral it was! She is so gentle, caring, and even her voice is soothing.  Those are very important qualities when dealing with terrified children.  The staff, like the office is very warm and welcoming. The waiting area is filled with kid-sized chairs, books, toys, and a TV playing a children's movie.  The exam rooms have overhead movies to watch during cleanings. Dr. Chen is very knowledgable, answered all my questions, and since she is a mother herself- she not only understands how to deal with the children- but with anxious moms too!
5	A friend referred me and I am so glad she did. The kids don't mind coming to the dentist and she made me feel confident on what she was recommending. I would recommend her to everyone!
5	I was very impressed by how caring and patient Dr Chen was with my 5 year old who needed some fillings.  She is really great with kids and puts in the extra time and energy needed to keep them as comfortable and calm as possible.  The staff is also very nice and the office and waiting room were very clean & kid friendly.
3	Referred to me by my neighbor. We have been visiting RRKD for a few years and like the rest of the reviews, all is great  except for our last visit. I had rescheduled the week before and due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to reschedule again.I called the day before the appointment as they were closed on Monday but was told they were fully booked solid for the next 2 weeks. I had no choice but to keep the appointment. When I was in the office that day, I clearly heard Judy giving someone on the phone 3 open dates to schedule an appointment for the following week!!! Too bad! I was just about to recommend a friend with 3 kids, one who needs major dental work to this practice but decided  against it as they might need a practice  who has a flexible schedule that could accommodate to their busy lifestyle.
