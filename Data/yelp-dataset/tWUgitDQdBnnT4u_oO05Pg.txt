4	Nice, new and clean. I like this Circle K, but all Circle K's lose a star for overcharging for 5 Hour Energy drinks. Also, they charge 75 cents for air. I'd rather go to QT where the air is free.
5	New Circle K format here.They started out great, with staff saying hello like a Quik Trip.  But that has fallen to a lower level recently.  If you go late at night, it's like pulling teeth when the person says hello.  I think night staff is more like your standard Circle K staff of the older stores.They have a huge selection of beverages here, coffee, slushes, soda, teas, etc.  Large store, very roomy.  Well designed gas pumps with 2 pumps per row, easy access in/out of driveways, convenient location.I hope they get back to the greeting customers each and every time with an upbeat, energetic tone.
2	I wish Circle K stores would increase their fuel max to $100 since my large truck usually uses about $80-$90.  Other than that, this location is larger than most...I think they are starting to figure out that QT is kicking their rear.  I just wish they would figure out a way to take better care of customers like me that probably buy more gas than people that own most cars.  Guess what guys!  QT lets me fuel up more than $75!
5	This is my favorite Circle K!  The employees are so nice and friendly.  They also have fresh brewed iced tea...which rocks my world!
