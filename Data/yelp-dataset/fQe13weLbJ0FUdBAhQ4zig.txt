4	I hadn't been inside a Laura Ashley store for years until yesterday (isn't it funny how you go into shops you'd normally pass by when on a shopping expedition with someone else?!) and I enjoyed looking through the racks of clothes, especially the sale rack. I didn't buy anything but I enjoyed my browse and it reminded me so much of my Laura Ashley craze of 20 years ago (that was the Exeter store). Most of the clothes on sale aren't really to my taste these days although there were many nice garments. The staff were very friendly and helpful, asking a couple of times if I wanted help in looking for something in particular. I must come across as a bit of a 'cheapskate' because, once again, I'm going to say that I thought many items were overpriced.
5	Really lovely assistants.  Loragene is on the ball with everything, and extremely helpful.  Helen L is also very attentive.  I hadn't been inside a Laura Ashley for decades but a search for the perfect black trouser led me there - and I got exactly what I wanted.  And in a promotion, too.   LA is now on my list of shops to pop into more frequently.  They have a good range of furniture, too as it's quite a big store.
