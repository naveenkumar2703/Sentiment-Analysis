1	My friends and I went to Sandey's Broaster Chicken on 1155 S Higley in Mesa, AZ. As loyal customers we are highly disappointed in the change. They have added an Indian Buffet to the restaurant. The macaroni and cheese was not cheesy but tasted like flour and was soupy. The cole slaw had an after taste to it like it had not been properly covered in the refrigerator at night and absorbed the odor of other foods. After leaving the restaurant the smell of the Indian curry lingered in our nostrils and attached to our clothing. Unfortunately, we will now have to find a new Broaster Chicken restaurant. We will not be going back.
3	I would really encourage Nancy to give this place a try again, it appears that Sandey's itself is under new management and has gotten rid of the Indian food in favor of BBQ as a kicker.I decided to try the 4 Piece chicken dinner, and was pleasantly surprised. While I waited for my dinner to be ready, I noticed another gentleman order some BBQ (I believe Tri-tip) that looked quite good and I believe I will stop in for that in the near future.As for my meal, I was really impressed with the quality of the chicken. The breast was really juicy and tender, and the dark pieces, while smaller than what you might expect, were exceptional. The size of the dark pieces really speaks to quality chicken, in my opinion - the way chicken is actually supposed to be. The sides were good but not memorable, though I only tried the corn on the cob and the broasted potatoes. The potatoes were a smaller order than I expected, and I'll probably be giving the baked beans and mac and cheese a try next time.The venue itself isn't much to look at, but the pricing is quite good for the fried chicken and defiantly something I would give a second try, as well as encourage my friends and family to visit.
4	One star for fear, two star for hope.Tried to call and see the status so i may be able to go out tonight. Got a automated voice asking me to enter the Buisinesses                                                                                             number over and over \But without hope... whats the point?I do so hope it was a glitch, and that it returned, Yes, the location was poor. and perhaps that's the problem, but the solution in sound,k and good food for a reasonable $$ for what you get. I bet if they delivered they would have broken even, if that was the problem. One taste of Broasters and The dear Harland David "Colonel" Sanders would do the honorable thing and shoot himself and  admit defeat(still.love a well ruin Popeye's , alas, there's one or two in the state all others are dressed up Churchs bland and yech, while a few still cook with precision and love, its just so rare                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          and I was really on a quest for something different to deliver on the ceap by southern  and Val Vista and this let me down this rabbithole!And just don't I come across as a terror Mayo clinic has been testing cancer related offshoots that seem to make concentration difficult     so this is actually "doing good?) hrm...
