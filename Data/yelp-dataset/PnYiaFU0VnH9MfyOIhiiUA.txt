5	One of the reasons I love this store is he staff. With all the budget cuts casinos have taken I'm surprised this store hasn't had any. I love this one woman Annaliza. She is fast, knows her clients and their body-types, and points you to their best sale items. Next best thing: SALES. I just shopped at 75% off retail---the stores down the strip at the mall can't beat these prices.Their selection is nice and with dirt cheap prices I know I will be back again soon.
