4	I thought I was in a midwestern bar in the late 1980's.  This is my kind of place with 6 pool tables in the bar.  They have reasonably priced drinks, they take care of their regulars, I have hit two four of a kinds here already and they have karaoke every Friday and Sunday night.  I dig it.
4	Dealer's Choice is one of those friendly bars that you like going to.I've only been here a handful of times...maybe three...and EVERYONE is super nice.  The bar staff is cool, and make good drinks.  (The kamikazes are good)They have great beer prices, and lots of pool tables. Plus, my favorite, karaoke nights!!  Friday AND Sunday night! Cool place.  I'll be going back for sure.
1	It's rare I have an experience that is actually criminal, but here you go. General shiftiness aside, I asked for a pour of makers mark. They poured from a makers mark bottle, but whatever was inside wasn't makers mark. That's right. They're stepping on even their low-mid shelf stuff with rot gut. Despicable.
4	Pool. Come here to play pool. And drink. Some of the nicest owners/bartenders you'll ever meet. It's definitely are regulars bar and gets packed with pool tournaments on the weekends.
