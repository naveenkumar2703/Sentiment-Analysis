5	Wow. They make keys too. That girl that works there is talented.
5	Great people and service.  The lady there gave me the different prices and explained the difference in shipping.  She actually saved me money.  I definitely will be doing all my business there.  In fact, I just opened a mailbox there .
4	They truly do about everything here. From copies to notary to keys. For a notarized testimony (which apparently costs more than other documents) and a long-distance fax of 3 pages, it cost me $11. Not too bad. The whole process went quickly and I was taken care of immediately. The staff were friendly. They even provide fax cover sheets.
5	Ive been doing business with them for about 6 months now. This place is neat and clean. They know their stuff. Tammi offeres many options to help keep costs down. I like they have U-Haul truck rentals. Tammi knows the business and also has alot of other things so just ask. Its nice to see nice people giving great service.
1	Not being open during posted hours when you have multiple customers outside in the heat waiting for your uhaul service is totally unacceptable.
5	Very friendly and fast service.  I had big chains.  I much prefer working with a small company.Tammy rocks!!!
