4	Decent tasting. Super cheap for the strip. Super duper cheap compared to the other offerings in the same food court. Not super authentic, but what do you expect from a Chinese take-out place in the middle of Las Vegas?
1	I realize that this chinese fast food "restaurant" is in the middle of the MGM hotel walkway and it caters to the foreigners so it's not truly authentic.  I get it.  But where does it say that just because it's not authentic chinese food it has to taste like crap?  The chow mein is tasteless and has way too much bean sprouts.  The mushroom chicken & broccoli beef are both missing flavor.  Yes, it's relatively cheap (1 item combo for $4.99) compared to other places like Nathan's (2 hot dogs, fries & a drink for $8???), but is it really worth it?My other gripe was I ordered to go and they gave me this HUGE container and gave me stingy amounts of food.  It looked like a stingy portion because the freakin container was so huge.  Here's a tip Studio Wok: if you're going to give less portions, get smaller containers so it looks like you're giving more.
3	A little bit too greasy and oily for my taste here.  I got the Orange Chicken and Beef & Broccoli with fried rice and noodles.  The taste is okay, but they really need to tone down the oil here.  You almost feel like you need extra white rice to soak up all the oil in your entree.  However, since it's located at the food court of the MGM Grand, it's very convenient to get your Chinese fast food and chow down before heading out to gamble/drink/party.
