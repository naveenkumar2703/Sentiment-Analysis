3	I don't go to BK that much,  but I've never had an issue with the service at this location.  No one has ever forgotten my food at the drive thru,  and all the employees seem competent and nice enough.   On this trip,  I didn't order my usual Whopper with cheese,  I decided to branch out and try the Big King.   I know it's BK's attempt to copy the Big Mac,  but eating it just left me wanting a Big Mac.   Oh,  I'm sure if you had never tried a Big Mac before,  it would probably taste perfectly fine, it was a decent fast food  burger.   But for someone like me who loved them as a kid,  it just wasn't the same.   Next time,  I'm sticking with the Whopper with cheese... Then I won't leave disappointed.
2	I go to this location often on the way to work, and the past six times I've ordered a double cheeseburger with bacon added... Lately they'll correct me, "YOU MEAN A BACON DOUBLE CHEESEBURGER???" Kind of meanly, So I say yes obviously because I guess that's a value menu item now. Six out of six times it has come with no bacon, while I'm still being charged for it. Most of those times they also give me no receipt, so I can't even go back after work. It may not seem like much to most people but seriously it wasn't a one time mistake, they're going to continue to misread their screens since they added that to the value menu instead of the old "cheeseburger + bacon." Kinda irritating.
