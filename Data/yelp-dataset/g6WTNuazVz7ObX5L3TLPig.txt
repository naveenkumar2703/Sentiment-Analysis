5	This place is awesome!  Larry was my tattoo artist and he was so friendly!  His work was great and he was fast!  My sparrow looks awesome!
5	This is my first tattoo and it was a good experience . Ray was nice and showed good customer service skills with 30 years experience . I will be going back for another one. The parking for this place is safe and conveniently in the front not in a back ally. This place wasn't to far from the strip either. Good price, not to  expensive .
5	It took me a long time to find Ray. I wish I would have 12 years earlier because I will never step foot into another tattoo shop EVER!
5	Ray was the first tattoo artist i found, and he will be my last! I have 3 by him, and ill get the rest of mine by him. He was patient with me for my first 2 that i got at the same time, and stopped when I needed it. Makes you feel comfortable and you get to pick the music while getting your work done. He doesn't mind you bringing people along to watch I'm in action. I think the prices are awesome, and fair. Love it here!
