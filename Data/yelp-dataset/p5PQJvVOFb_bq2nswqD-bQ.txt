4	This used to be a jazz station (smooth jazz- that I liked, BTW) so when I heard this station while in my husband's uncle's car a few weeks back, I really liked the format. It's Old School R & B- a mix of music from the 50's, 60's, 70's (second favorite), & 80's (my favorite out of the eras mentioned). I used to like 93.1 FM's play list (which included the long forgotten freestyle music I grew up with) but it always seem to change, doesn't it? Anyway, this morning, I heard "It Takes Two", "I Feel For You" and "In My House." This are songs that aren't played on the radio anymore. I miss this music. Well, now I have a choice, and I can flip to this one, if another preset is playing commercials (boring).
1	Bring back the smooth jazz that we followed  for years, this new format is boring and a sad excuse for music selections. Took it off of my presets on everything., Oasis 105.7 is gone I guess...too bad  .Could not give it less than one star or I would have.............
5	Just moved to Vegas and this station is my new guilty pleasure! I love it! Love it! Love it! Reminds me of KTWV in Los Angeles. I wish that they would throw in more jazz like the Wave does, but I love the old school mix! I get hear Parliament/Funkadelic, Zapp & Roger, nobody is playing them like these folks are! If you come to Vegas, turn to this station...oh, and Art LeBoe is on...whoo hoo!!! Love IT!!!
4	I have been in the LV  since December 2013, and I still love this station! My wish is that really dig into the crates and play some stuff that hasn't been heard in a long while! Examples: slave, New birth, I heard a kc and the sunshine band song that noone played in ages and I heard it on 88.1. Yes, I have discovered the other station! I still love this station but Tuesday and Thursday is 88.1. I know you guys can step it up.
