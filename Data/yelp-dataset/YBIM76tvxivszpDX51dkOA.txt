4	I wasn't expecting too much from Saiyems when I first went there- the bright yellow exterior shouted - tacky- to me, but my friend who lives locally to the area insisted that their curries are great, and he was right. We ordered on a Wednesday night just before a Champions League game and so it was quite busy with other people having the same idea of watching the match over a curry. We waited inside the restaurant and it is a lot more quaint and respectable than the exterior, although that isn't hard. I ordered a chicken bhuna with 2 papadums and a garlic naan bread, the prices here are pretty decent and for the quality and portions of food, it offers good value. The naan bread was one of the freshest I have had and not at all greasy, whilst the chicken bhuna was flavoursome and the chicken very fresh and tender.
