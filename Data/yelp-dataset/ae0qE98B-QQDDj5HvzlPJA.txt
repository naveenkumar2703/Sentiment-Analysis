5	I purchased a S&W rifle as a gift and had it shipped here. Shane was very friendly and helpful, taking the time to answer a bunch of my questions. One thing that stood out: I expected the delivery to arrive on a Thursday, but USPS was late. I sent Shane a text after hours to double-check that it hadn't arrived and Shane responded that same night. Pretty cool. Anyway, I learned a lot from the visit and will definitely be back.
5	Have used Shane three times in the past several months, he's great. Professional, knowledgable and more than fair priced. All around squared away, stand-up guy, I wouldn't use anyone else.Dave L.Scottsdale
5	I ordered an S&W MP15 and and AK and had it delivered to pick up from here. All went well and quickly. Will use again
5	An odd location for an FFL, in one half of a barbershop, but Shane has always done me right.  Over the course of at least 4 transactions, he has always been perfectly transparent with communication and smoothly gotten me out the door.  All while being affordable.  I highly recommend Shane if are anywhere in the near vicinity!
5	Used Shanes' Enterprises for a purchase from Buds Gun Shop as he is a preferred FFL on their site. Also close to my office, so bonus. Fast communication and easy to work with. Recommended.
