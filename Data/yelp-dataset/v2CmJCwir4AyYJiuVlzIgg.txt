4	Wow--I'm surprised this hasn't been reviewed yet!  Apparently, the Bead Bin has been around for quite some time.  They have moved into larger stores as their inventory has grown.  I'm a huge fan of the semi-precious stone strands.  It's usually the first thing I check out when going to a new bead store.  Imagine my surprise when I found these strands at REASONABLE prices!  I even went home and did some research online before I bought to check comparable prices.  Needless to say, I went back to the Bead Bin to make some really great purchases.  My only complaint is that I wish the semi-precious selection were larger!  I found the rest of the store to be very reasonably priced as well.  They carry a large selection of seed bads, czech glass, findings, books and magazines.  They had magazine back issues, which I'm a big fan of as well.  So far, this is my favorite bead store in my area.  It's well worth the half hour drive for me.  As a bonus, you can stop by Wisconsin Craft Market which is located in the same strip mall.  They always have great markdowns and almost always have a coupon you can link to from their website.  It usually saves you 25% off your entire purchase.
5	Every time I go up to Madison, I hit up this bead store!! Great selection from Vintaj to semi precious to vintage glass beads. Huge Swarovski and sterling selections. Reasonable prices and a helpful staff. If you only have time for one bead store in Madison- GO HERE!
5	I was afraid to go in and find that this shop was so different from the Bead Bin it would just make me sad. Not true the owner is super nice and she used to work at the bead bin for 9 years and so a nice mix of old and new is there.  I THOUGHT I could leave without buying but nooooo... Her vintage crystals are amazing! So yep making some earrings this weekend!BTW Bored ?? They have an awesome selection of classes for adults and KIDS!  Great way to get kids into a fun hobby!
