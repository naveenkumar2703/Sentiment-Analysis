5	Sometimes when I meet my friends that work across town for lunch, this is where I go.The layout of this place seems to make more sense than other stores further west of this location.The people here are super, super friendly and they make it kind of fun to order your food.  The ingredients do seem a bit more fresh than other Subways I go to as well.Can't go wrong with this place!
4	Love this location staff is super nice only one girl questioned and gave me horrible looks over my sandwich (or maybe that was just her face) ....I order my sandwich with extra jalapenos and banana peppers....I tell them dont stop til u think its gross! Any hoo that girl isnt there any more but i would totally give five stars BUT!!!!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one! its so annoying and as a small business owner im telling you spend the extra two cents because i cant tell you how many times i got home and cursed at my half exposed unsanitary sandwich!~~Im telling you (i use to work at a sandwich shop at 17) it is much easier on everyone with two papers do that i will be five stars all the way!
5	I love subway, and I'm planningnon going for lunch today to get my $5 footling tuna sandwich ^~^ awwwwsomewe
4	Your typical, delicious smelling subway. There's not a ton of seating (or at least not compared to the other subways I've been to), but the one time I've dined in instead of getting it to go, it seemed that most people weren't staying in to eat. So it works.
5	Fast service and a charming smile from Jordan makes my visit to Subway always a pleasant experience. Keep up the good work! A smile can make someone's day a little better when they're not having a good day!
