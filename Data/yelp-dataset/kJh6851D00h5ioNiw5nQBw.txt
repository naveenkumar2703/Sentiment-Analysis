4	Very cool out of the way place.  I think they cater more to the professional crowd that does entire landscapes and backyard makeovers.  This place has EVERYTHING!  Come here if you are planning to make changes.  It is an excellent idea stimulator.
4	Really interesting place and definitely somewhere you should stop off and take a look at if you have the time.  It has a huge campus and tons of options of things to look at throughout.  Everything from small plants / succulents / pots, to large plant-able trees and giant pots that could easily be used for decor around the yard!  If you are in the Cave Creek area swing on by and walk around - it's worth it.Overall: A-
