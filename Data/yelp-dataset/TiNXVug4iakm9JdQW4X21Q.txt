5	After reading Brian S' review of the pricing scheme at Scottsdale Auto Salon, I thought "hey, I'm going to review my favorite gas station."  Looks like Brian beat me to the punch, but I'm going to concur with his 5-star assessment.  I always went to this station when it was a Mobil, even though their pumps were crappy and always out of paper, because they had cheap gas.  Still do under Circle K, but the pumps are all new and pretty now.But, it's still just a gas station.  It's the convenience store part that impresses me.  Truthfully, I've never looked around much.  Only stopped for drinks and lottery tickets, but I've been lucky enough to see the same gentleman working there most times.  And he is a gentleman.  I feel terrible I can't remember his name, but he is always so friendly.  Friendly as in happy with his life, glad to have a job and a customer to wait on.  Stopped in on Thanksgiving and he was so happy the day was set up in 4-hour shifts to allow employees time with their families.  I would have spent the whole 4 hours bitching about working at ALL, but not Mr. Gentleman.  And if I ever get the winning Powerball ticket, I'm going to remember him...and get his name.
4	Came here for gas and had to go inside because I typed in the wrong zip code.  Dude working the overnight saw I was driving an Acura and started having a car conversation... with himself.  I don't know shit about cars, just my car.  But he told me all about his car.  Call me crazy, but I appreciate just meeting interesting people rather than get a "thank you" when I pay.  Thanks for the free entertainment, dude!
3	good price for gas.
