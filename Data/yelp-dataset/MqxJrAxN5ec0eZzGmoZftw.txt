1	Crap. Bud Light, Miller Lite, Coors Light on tap and not much else. Guinness from a can?  Seriously?  Cold fried food and way overpriced appetizer sampler.  Server never offered silverware or condiments like salt. Avoid.
1	Wow - not good. The place was really not what I expected at all. The selections were few, and the food - cold.
