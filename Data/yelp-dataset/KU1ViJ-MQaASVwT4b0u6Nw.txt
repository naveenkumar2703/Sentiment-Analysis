4	For some reason, I am able to get more work done at this place than any library, Starbucks, or at my own house. The music is loud and the lighting is a little off-kilter, but it just wakes up the productivity in me. The coffee is good, and there are a couple of pool tables tucked away in the corner. If you're looking for a place to hide away with headphones and a book, here's your spot.
