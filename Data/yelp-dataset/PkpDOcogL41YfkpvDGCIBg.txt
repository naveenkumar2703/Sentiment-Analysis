5	Came by to check out the Prius and James was extremely patient and helpful. I, like many of u, going to a car dealership can be quite frightening as most of the time salesperson can be very pushy but not James. If u are looking for a stress free buying experience, I strongly suggest talking to James.
5	I always disliked dealing with car salesmen until I met James Johnson  at Toyota!  James is an awesome salesman with a very pleasant personality.  James answered all my questions and was very patient even when he had my new car ready for me to drive away  I changed my mind and wanted a different Prius James just smiled when we had to start from the beginning a second time. If your thinking about buying a new car go see James Johnson at Toyota on Sahara..
1	This place is a joke bad service the complementary service on my paper said 30000 miles my car have only 20000 the said I had to pay for the service 75 dollars fucking morons
5	Came to get my maintenance done Didn't have a appointment but it wasn't that busy.When you enter there is a nice young lady that helps and greets youI had Ruben assigned to me he was nice  and funny. Over all great service
5	It appears that this is not the business. The business is David Wilson's Toyota of Las Vegas. When you call a regular person answers. Not the dealership. This is very confusing and perhaps Yelp should clarify it.
