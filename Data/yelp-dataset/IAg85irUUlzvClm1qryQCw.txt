3	Went with the 3 stars today and that was stretching it. Have been into this bakery twice now both time for savoury pies, which are my favorite, and both times when I got my pies they were cold throughout them both! The first time I had a steak and ale pastry which although had good flavour were a bit to salty and I felt like I had gotten my daily dose of Na+ for the day! This pastry was cold as well. The second time I went I decided to have a haggis pie . It looked quite good there was a little scoop of mashed tatie on top and on top of that a nice neat little scoop of mashed neeps. Overall it looked quite yummy , but once biting into it it to was as cold as Pluto (still a planet btw or at least should be) . It was also a bit bland and perhaps the pastries got the salt the haggis pie was suppose to. But I still feel like this place is decent and I have not written them off because they are full of sweet doughnuts and goodies of such which I'm sure are quite good and better then any Krispy Kreme garbage.  Until next time !
3	throughout  the summer this was the place that l frequently went to during the summer month's. On display they have a nice selection of cakes, breads and warm pie's l swear that l got two warm one's one day.Some staff are nice and polite and there are staff that is not nice or polite that go the extra mile to ignore you.There are drinks on display and I'm sure that they do tea & coffee but staff are not trained to upsell, so don't offer any extras.
