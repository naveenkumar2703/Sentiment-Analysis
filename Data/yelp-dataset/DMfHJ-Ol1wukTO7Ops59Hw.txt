5	I'm from Chicago but I stopped in when I was visiting a friend in Scottsdale and was pleasantly surprised with the nice new layout.  Everything is nicer in Scottsdale, LOL... Great workout when you're traveling.
5	Love this place! I have tried some of the other locations and they are all good but this places has the best trainer in my opinion. They are very professional and not intimidating at all. The facility is clean and very well kept. I have nothing but good things to say about this place.. Wether you see getting back into shape or trying to loose weight, try here you will love it.
5	Great facility, boxing is a very unique workout. Trainers are awesome - large classes with personal attention. Rest assured you won't be disappointed!
