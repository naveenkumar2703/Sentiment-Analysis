4	I was there last night, and tried their Ribeye Steak and Mashed Potatoes (Yes, they were real!).  Very reasonably priced ($14.99), and delicious.  The kids had hamburgers.  They were HUGE!  1/2 pound burgers.  All in all you really get alot of food for your money.
1	I think the " ribeye" was the thinnest I have ever seen. I think they sliced it in half. I've had better at Denny's. Tasteless and way overpriced on the food. Very disappointed.
5	We were here on Friday, 12/16/11 and really liked everything about it. There were 5 of us and everyone ordered something different.  And all of us thought our food was delicious! The staff was very friendly but we were there with locals, which helps. The prices were reasonable and the place was clean.There was live music but I didn't get who they were. It was two guys, one with a fiddle, so you can't go too wrong. They were pretty good.It was early so it wasn't too crowded. It started to pick up as we were leaving. We will be back when we're in town! And if you're a veggie person, you gotta try the portobello burger with sweet potato fries ..... It's outstanding!
5	Limited menu but the baby back ribs were awesome.  Also had a great marguerita.  DJ music.
