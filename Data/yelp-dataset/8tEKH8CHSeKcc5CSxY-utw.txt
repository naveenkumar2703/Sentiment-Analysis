3	they sell Propane. Gas is always the highest in the area. The staff is always friendly and its always clean.
5	Super staff tonight! We stopped while heading north. They sell beer on tap! Craft beers in a refillable bottle. In 32 or 64 ounce bottles.
4	Good place to stop on your way out of town if you need gas or a drink. Easy exit on Carefree Highway and easy to get back on the 17. It is a common meeting place for motorcyclists, so please watch where you're going and be mindful of them.This is one of many gas stations that have for some reason gotten into the business of keeping kegs and filling growlers. Be forewarned that the way they fill growlers (straight from a tap and not using a hose) will cause your growler to go flat within 24 hours. Fine if you plan to drink it same-day, but don't fill a growler here expecting to put it in your fridge for a week.
3	After shopping at the Outlets in Anthem, Arizona....we stopped here to fill up the tank.  Gasoline prices were fairly priced considering it is right off the freeway.  Store looked okay inside.  I'd probably stop in again.  Would not be a regular if I lived in the area, though.
