1	Congratulations to the Democratic party for being so divided that they can't even agree on a candidate to be considered for the general election.  Nice job fellas.  You're pushing a candidate who didn't even get a clear majority of YOUR party's votes lol.  What's one half of one half?  A quarter of the whole?  Why don't you just give McCain the keys to the White House already.
1	Senator Harry Reid is a moron!!! That's it. -10 starsUpdate:  I guess only one person here is aloud to have an opinion. Actually I was born and raised here in Las Vegas. So the fact that you are a die hard democrat makes my opinion uneducated. No the fact that Harry Reid puts so much time and effort into trying to get Yucca Mtn. stopped instead of embracing it is where I am coming from. So because of his continued fight to stop something that is unstop-able we are now not in control. Since it is not being used as it is supposed to the Fed Gov owes some $300 million  per year for not fulfilling it's contract. ( wasting even more money ) If we had chosen to accept it we would have had the upper hand and demanded money for our roads and railways to be improved. They have spent so much money on Yucca Mtn. that there is no way it will not be used. By the way I have been there ( just before you assume to know who I am again )
1	Gotta agree fully with Mike on this one. They're pushing Obama so hard that we may as well give the presidential election to McCain. Maybe it's time to move to Canada...
