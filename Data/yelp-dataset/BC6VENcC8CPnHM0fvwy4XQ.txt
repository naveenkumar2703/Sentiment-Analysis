3	Tired of the crowds, not yet hungry, and still wanting a drink, we all walked over to the Center Bar before we headed up to continue the party in the rooms.Great patrons who are extremely friendly and bartenders with heavy hands...love that!  Got to enjoy the lounge couches with our whole party.  And with the most handsome of our men being in a wheelchair, we were pleased that the seating area was easily accessible for him.We didn't stay too long, just enough for a couple drinks while we ogle the eye candy, and watch all the HRH stumblers go by.Next time I'll have to try their HH, but would go anytime anyway! =)
4	we like this bar as a meeting point. BUT: hookers hang out there too... Some douchebags of bartenders work there... so if you are Local I wouldnt hang out there too much.... Other than that, its a fun place. There is funner, like Johnny Smalls or Pink Taco.
4	I've always been a big fan of the Center Bar at HRH.  There's quite a mixed bag of people and you have a good chance at some fascinating conversation.  This bar used to be prostitute central earlier this century but its cleaned up a little bit.  Kind of bummed they got rid of cheap super fun 21 tables on the outer rim.  But I do like the new TV's they put at the top of the bar and I still prefer the music at HRH over any other casino in town.
1	the bar tender seemed more focused on flirting with the "call girl" sitting next to us than actually helping bar patrons. DEFINITELY WILL NOT BE COMING BACKOVER PRICED DRINKS
