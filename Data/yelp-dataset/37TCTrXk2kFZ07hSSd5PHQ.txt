5	What passion do most guys have, regardless of age, ethnicity, or any other factor you can think of?  ELECTRONICS!Me and my other two coworkers had some time to kill between days on our conference, so we drove across the street from our hotel to the local strip mall.  We walked to the directory and saw Ultimate Electronics.  Score!  The only problem:  it was hot has Hades outside and the store was about 200 yards away.  Our passion of electronics did overcome the blistering heat, so we trekked across the sahara-like parking lot and entered the store.WOW.  There were LCD and plasma tv's everywhere, practically littered on the ground.  In the far room in the back, I estimated that there must have been at least half a million dollars worth of T.V.s there.  Crazy.There is also a car audio / visual area as well with a display truck totally customized with crazy sounds and screens on it.  I had to explain "hater-vision" to my coworker (screens on the back of the rear headrest so only people driving behind you can see it)Even though we told them we were just killing time, they still offered us water to drink!  Amazing customer service.  I realize it's not royal treatment, but a glass of cold water in that heat is almost worth its weight in gold.If I lived in Phoenix, I would definetely come here to get a T.V.  I saw a lot of good deals that I wished I could have carried home.
1	Well...no worries for the continued bad service...awful prices...average inventory....and just overall bad experience....because the store closes forever this weekend. I have never cared for the place....so I definitely won't miss it. However if your looking for some decent electronic gear at 60-80% off....then this is your weekend to go. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends
