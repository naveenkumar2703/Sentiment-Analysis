5	Uniforms for officers. Caters to PPD and MSCO Highway Patrol, and a few others I can't remember... but their customer service is amazing. Wide selection of apparel and police accessories. A little more on the pricy side, but if you've been to uniform places, the price is worth the added customer service :)
5	28 stars for this place!!! They have EVERYTHING you will need (including beautiful smiles and excellent service)!!!!
5	Bought some 511 gear for my husband.  The lady was very nice and even shipped to a APO box address for me.  I love seeing pink gear.  Got a free pen too lol love free stuff...They have everything tactical from shoes, knives, protective gear, to clothes.  It's a little hidden but if you park by Wells Fargo or bank of America area you can find the place..
