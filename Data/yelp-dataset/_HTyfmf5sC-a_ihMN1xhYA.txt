3	Cool guys, very informative.  Couldn't find what I was looking for but they were still very helpful.  It's a small store so the stock selection is not that extensive.
3	My wife has recently started learning to change her oil and make repairs on her car. I ofter get dragged along to go get parts. They all know her there by now. Everyone is always friendly and ready to answer her questions and give her advice.
4	This review will be sweet and simple for AutoZone because it is just that. I needed new wiper blades for my civic so I stopped by during that little patch of rain we had a few months back. The service is always great and the sales clerk looked up and selected the blades I needed for my car. He even came out and installed them for me which was an added courtesy that I really appreciated.I also like the fact that they have a few locations around town that are 24/7 for last minute or late emergencies.My car which I have named the "Blue Zombie"  is a fun project of mine and I have been enjoying replacing parts here and there so this is my spot for car goodies internal and external.
1	Meh!!!! I'm not a car person by any means, I hear wonderful things about Auto Zone, but to me they are not much better then a Walmart.  I've been to two different store in the last few months and I go in knowing nothing and leave knowing less.  Maybe its just the female in me but yeah nothing to write home about.  I'll stick to Google for any automotive question i may have in the future.
