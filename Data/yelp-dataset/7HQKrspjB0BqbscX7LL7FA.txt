1	so I ordered as usual not allot of waiting from order to window... I get to the window and the employee asks me my order... slightly annoyed I repeat it and he sass..." Your Order Got Deleted"... so I pay the $7.31.. Thinking the entire time.... (being a Ronald McDonald's graduated of 83') Errors like this is an "Automatic Free Meal".. Will have to email Corp office on my "Deleted Order"
3	New remodel is looking good. Food is consistent the lot is a little bit harder to get to than some locations. Decent staff.
2	So the drive thru avg during rush hour but what pissed me off I get my dollar large tea dude it was all ice. Come on you guys make too much to cheep me out of 4oz of tea thanks for the ice.
1	Been here about 7 times over the last year and there retarded ... I dont know how many grades it takes to pass to throw in hot fries and the right sauces when you order a 7 dollar meal ... avoid this place like the plague ..
