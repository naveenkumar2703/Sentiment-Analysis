5	I worked with Jamal F. Allen & Associates when doing contract negotiations for a business purchase.  He was extremely helpful from start to finish and his focused attention makes you feel like you are always his number one client.  He never spoke over my head, he took time to explain his concerns and edits.  It felt good having someone firmly in my corner looking out for my best interests.  In addition, his support staff are just as courteous and knowledgeable and made me feel important every time I called.  I will definitely be using Jamal's legal services again in the future.  Thank you!
