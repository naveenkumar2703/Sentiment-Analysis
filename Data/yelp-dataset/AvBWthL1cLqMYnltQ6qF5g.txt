4	Hate to give it up because I enjoy eating Breakfast here on the weekends when all the big names in the area are overcrowded with long waits. Great inexpensive food. Biscuits and gravy, homefries and ham and bacon all awesome! Owner and staff are friendly and efficient! Always great friendly service, hope you enjoy!
1	Business is closed.  Reopened under another name but currently "closed for summer".  Hope it reopens.
1	Biscuit and Gravy not very good.
