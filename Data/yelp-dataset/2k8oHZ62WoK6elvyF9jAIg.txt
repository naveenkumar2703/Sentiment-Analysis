4	While taking a break during our exploration of Old Town Scottsdale, our group came across a handsome horse-drawn carriage in front of the Scottsdale Mall. It turns out that KC's Classic Carriage Company offers free coach rides every Friday and Saturday from 1-4 p.m. What a great way to get into the spirit of the Old West and explore this scenic neighborhood!The shire horses are very gentle and welcome muzzle pats. In honor of Valentine's Day, the horses were sporting hoof-i-cures in pretty pinks and purples--even the males, like Eddie.
4	Super kid friendly! The women who had their horses waiting for tourists allowed the young one in our group to pet their horses. I will plus one what Julie K. said. I have never seen hoofs painted before (coats yes).. they were super sparkly purple... blinks...... When I see stuff like this which always makes me wonder if the horses care. If you are into this kind of thing and want to keep the children temporarily occupied it is a good bet. We ended up not riding but hanging out nearby and watching.
5	This is one of the coolest things to do during the holidays.  The kids will LOVE it!  We did the coach ride, for free on a Saturday.   Going to treat the kids to a carriage ride this winter, when all the lights are up in Downtown for the holidays :)   They will really love that!
