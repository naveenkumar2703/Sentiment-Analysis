4	If you're looking to enjoy a peppery burger surrounded by very short skirts and cleavage in nurses outfits, then look no further. Vegetarians should roll their eyes, and vegans should run screaming: Honesty is the policy here, where the "Flatliner Fries" are boldly declared to be "Fried in lard" on the menu. This place makes no pretenses: it's exactly what you'd expect. And it's perfect.The menu is simple. They have a single-bypass, double-bypass, tripple-bypass burgers etcetera where single refers to the number of 1/2 pound patties. The flatliner fries, soda, beer, and cigarettes take care of the rest.
4	A great Burger and sexy babes there to serve it to you!  They leave no pretense that the burgers are straight up bad for you and that the fries are cooked in lard!  they have only three other things for sale; soda, beer, and cigarettes.   the By-pass burgers are priced on how many 1/2 pound (not quarter pound)  patties you want.  They taste great but I did a triple by pass and wasn't right for a day ..really!  I played around of golf right after and thought that the walk would be good for me but i could feel my digestive track hating on me for the massive influx of grease and fat!  This prototype place is going to be a big hit in college towns!
