5	When I was in extreme pain Dr. Lubitz was the only person to relieve it. I wish it was closer to Avondale.
5	If you are looking for relief from back pain, headaches or whatever it may be look no further! He has helped me tons. Dr. Bruce is the best & is very practical in his approach. All done without drugs & completely natural. Highly recommend you see him!
5	I've had a bad back for years, from an old sports injury, and it acts of fairly frequently. This last time I simply couldn't shake the pain and I decided to visit Dr. Lubitz based on his other positive Yelp reviews. After two visits I was feeling nearly back to 100%. Since that time, I've continued to visit him 2-3 times per week and most of my back issues are gone. I'm sleeping better than I have in years, plus I have more energy.The doctor is kind and compassionate and doesn't mind staying late to accommodate my work schedule.Great find!
3	The Doctor is Great!
