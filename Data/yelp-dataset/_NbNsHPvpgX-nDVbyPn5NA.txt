3	Lots of Halloween stuff at the store excited Christmas is also sneaking in what happened to Thanksgiving.This $.99 stores pretty nice has a lot of good stuff in it, The cashiers need to speak a lot better English and it seems to have long lines and they need more cashiers but overall it's okay place I'm a fan.

3	I like the $.99 stores I don't care for the other dollar tree and doller general and all those other ones the original with the purple $.99 is this,But the problem with this store is they only have one register a lot of the times I think I'll be more efficient quicker if they open more registers but I keep going there because it's the only one close to me, and always find what I need and what I don't want.
2	Came here today to see if I could find some last minute things for Thanksgiving. I don't have a problem with (most of) the products they sell, but man! Talk about grumpy workers!! I bought some canned food for a food drive and the girl that checked me out today was banging the stuff down on the counter. Never cracked a smile. I guess that's what you expect when you shop at the 99 cent store. I'm gonna go drown my sorrows in a Dutch Bros coffee - at least THEY seem to actually LIKE their job.
