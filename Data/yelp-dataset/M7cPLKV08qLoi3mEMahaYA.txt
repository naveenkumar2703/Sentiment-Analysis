3	Stopped in here for breakfast one day. No complaints, the restaurant was pretty simple. It has a diner like setting. It appears to be pretty dated on the inside and could use some sprucing up. The 80's came here and never left. A young kid (son?) operated the cash. I would give him about 13. He knows his stuff and will probably run a diner empire some day. I am thinking his mom was the cook. The two made quite a pair and the food came out as ordered and fairly quick.Nothing special here, just a solid breakfast for under $5. Would go again.
2	Quick and cheap, but that's about it. Interior is old and faded, food is meh even by greasy spoon standards. You get what you pay for, and you don't pay for much here. Seriously, stop here only if you want a cheap breakfast and don't have time to make it yourself.
1	Stopped here for a cheap takeout lunch thinking it'd be just as good as their cheap breakfast. I ordered the hot hamburger with mashed potatoes for $5.95. They ended up running out of mashed potatoes and replaced it with a measly salad (they failed to tell me this was extra while leaving me thinking it was complementary). The burger patty came without a bun, and sat on a single slice of bread drenched in gravy while the measly salad sat in a corner of the styrofoam takeout box. I expected more for $8. I'll be avoiding Slices in the future...
