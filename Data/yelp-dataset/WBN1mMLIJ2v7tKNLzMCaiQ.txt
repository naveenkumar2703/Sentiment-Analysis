4	Their arrangements are attractive and feature a great combination of whatever is in season, but its their customer service that impresses me most. Recently I ordered a centerpiece and three small bowl arrangements for a friend's baby shower. They called me to discuss preferences of color, styles and flowers. They came in under budget. They delivered them on time. And, five days later, the flowers still look fresh.I also dropped by once on the fly and they had several ready-made arrangements to choose from They also offered to add little touches to make it exactly what I wanted. I was rudely told by two other stores in my neighborhood that ALL arrangements had to be ordered in advance. I say pfffffffft to that.Now the bonus is that they're in a shopping center with other locally owned restaurants and stores where I prefer to shop. So, Flower Shoppe definitely gets my future business.
5	Lupe has been amazing helping me plan and re-plan my wedding flowers.  I am sure she must think I am a crazy bride but she is always patient and very understanding when I call or stop in with questions or concerns.  With all of the hectic things going on around me, I know Lupe at the Flower Shoppe has everything under control and this is an area I am simply not worried about!  I have found a florist for life!
5	We got a food basket from the Flower Shoppe. We had it shipped to my family in Oregon. My parents were so please and said what great job the Flower Shoppe had done. Thank you so much for your kindness and good work. We will definately use you again.
