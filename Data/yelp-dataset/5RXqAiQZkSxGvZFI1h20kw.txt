3	A mix of old and new Modern Classics in an easy and accessible setting. They have some really great vintage pieces, that seem well-researched and priced to match. The new pieces are from Herman Miller and include decorative items and office chairs. Nice selection of home accessories and a few jewerly items that make browsing a little more likely to pay off.You won't find any great bargain scores here, but you will find high-quality and great condition.
4	Well curated, some great stuff. Not garage sale cheap, but certainly not in the stratosphere of Lost City Arts either. Wish for a bigger space and more days open - Fri thru Sunday is just a bit too brief for me. Otherwise, recommended.
5	Not a huge selection, but they have some really tremendous vintage pieces. I got my 1956 Rosewood and black leather Herman Miller Eames Lounge & Ottoman in very good condition here--for $4k.  That is remarkable.
4	Whew! They have beautiful things, really, but they are pretty pricey. While they have authentic pieces in good shape, it still seems like it's a bit on the steep side. Even their accessories were expensive (and, at least in the case of the radios, not guaranteed to work). I'd shop here if money were no object, but even for a middle-class home, things seemed out of reach, at least for me. But I'm giving it four stars because if you can afford their prices, you'll find some awesome stuff!
