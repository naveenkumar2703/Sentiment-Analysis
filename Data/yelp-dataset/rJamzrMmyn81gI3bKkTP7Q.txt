5	These people literally charge $40 an hour for ANY sort of cleaning. I had them work on my apartment for 3 hours and it was the best money I have spent in a long time.
5	I've used Kleen Geeks for two years and every single time I am impressed with the service. They are prompt, professional and make our home look beautiful!
5	My small business has used Kleen Geeks for over a year.  We are very pleased with their service, their flexibility, and their value.  If we need to adjust the schedule or ask for special services, they are easy to get hold of and very accommodating.
1	I have out-of-town guests coming this weekend so I scheduled Kleen Geeks a month in advance.  I even reminded them of the appointment last week.  They assured me they would be there.  When no one showed up, I started calling: 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours past their appointment time.  Not only did they not show up, but no one answered the phone or returned their voicemails.  I am really, really disappointed.
1	Had an appointment scheduled with them a month in advance. Was hosting a special event at my home. Received a invoice morning of scheduled cleaning however when the appointment time came and passed nobody showed.  The owner Quian wouldn't answer her phone and the man at the office said he would have her call me and she never did. Very unreliable. Would not recommend this company.
