4	Great sandwiches the turkey original is my favorite. They aren't super fast but it's worth the wait. Way better then anything subway or paradise bakery has to offer. On a side note I tried the pizza one time and it was cold in the middle. Stick to the sammiches.
4	Stopped in while waiting for an oil change. Short wait and very curteous staff. They brought me napkins with my Club on a nice plate.Just a tad pricier than something like Subway, but better quality.
5	By far the best place to grab a sandwich or salad. Not your normal 'fast food' feel. Use real plates. Manager treats you like royalty. Never a bad experience
