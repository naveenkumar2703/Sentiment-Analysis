5	In the building with all the rest of the Phoenix natural medicine spots, corner to Lola/Pita Jungle. Was greeted by super friendly people and encouraged to discuss what I like and dislike in juice so they could help me pick one. While I was waiting one of the other business owners popped in and was very friendly & encouraged me to take a tour of the other business. They open much later now, around 9a, so I won't be able to come here often, but I think it's a great local business with good fresh juice!
5	Found this place on Yelp.  Was unable to make my juice last night for today.  So I stopped in for a juice from the Juice Bar.  I was greeted by a very nice lady that made my juice for me and gave me some great advice that I will follow.  I am so happy to have found this place.  Funny thing is, I have driven by this place 3 times a week for months and never stopped in.  So glad that I did.  I went about 9:30 and it appeared that they may have just been opening.
5	Very good. They know what they are doing. They sell loads of herbs too, if that's your thing.I will warn you that if you park behind the building and try to go in from the south entrance, it is very confusing because it doesn't look anything like a juice bar. You have to go through the healing center to find it. If you go in from the main entrance on the north side, you will have no confusion.
