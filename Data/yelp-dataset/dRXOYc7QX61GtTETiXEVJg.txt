5	This is my home parish, and has been since my freshman year of college at ASU.  My wife and I still love it here, years after graduating, and were even married by Fr. Fred in January of 2009!
5	This chapel is really cute! Right across the street from campus :) I've been to mass here twice they have mass here daily m to fri at 6:30 pm and on sat at 5 they also have mass sunday at 12 pm. I loved the priests homily he was so funny! He's current and up to date and relates very well to the students as he talked about Taylor swifts swifts song we are never getting back together!! I actually had a newman center on my campus and it was similar to this one :)
5	Been going to this place since I went to ASU for Nursing.  I like their approach of involving everyone in the community.  The homily are fun and young students can relate to it.  The activities they offer are great.
5	We have been going to a much larger and modern church and this felt more like a home parish. I am not Catholic but a lot of my family and I have attended many Catholic churches, as well as a tone of different denominational churches. This is one I will remember just because of they way it felt to be there.There is a lot of history here and it would be a great place to get back to the basics and having a home parish.
