2	Great service, decent price, small portions...I ordered hummus, pesto and veggies on flatbread, it was tasty, but I had garlic breath for the rest of the day afterward.  Passable for a fast and inexpensive lunch, but not something I would seek out.
5	Tropical smoothie is one of my favorite go to places. I always get health nut with soy protein instead. My family has tried almost everything. Everything is good except the sandwiches are smaller than expected. Every tropical smoothie is a franchise, therefore, happy hours and hours of operation varies. This location is the one I go to the most. Happy hour is from 5-7p.m. and it's buy 1 get 1 for $1.99. Tropical smoothie is a Vegas local spot. Check it out!
