I never imagined a company in this industry could be so professional, clean and customer focused than these guys.  They're very competitive in paying top dollar for my recyclables. I also discovered they now recycle and pay for clothing, which is odd. Reviewing the company's website it's my understanding they recycle paper, cardboard and clothing to make insulation... all transformed under one roof. How refreshing to see my old newspapers converted into a sustainable eco-friendly. The bonus... Each time I visit there's always a departing gift of a complimentary bottle of ice-cold water, a welcomed gesture of appreciation on extreme triple-digit days.

It's painless, just drive up to where the bins are, and whoever is manning the dump, assists with your stuff from your car then they weigh and give you a paper with the weight, afterwards you drive up to their exit, where a lady translates the weight to what you'll get money wise. Bring your recyclables on the last Wed. of the month to get double the price on your goods.
