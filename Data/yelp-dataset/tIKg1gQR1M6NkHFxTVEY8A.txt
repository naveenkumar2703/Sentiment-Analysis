5	I had been going to the same dental office for many years, only because I liked my hygienist.  The dentists changed with the seasons and I wasn't really happy with any of them, so I found Dr. Wirth and decided to give him a try. Yeah me!Dr. Wirth is not going to set the Scottsdale scene aflame.  I can't imagine him ever talking to me about cosmetic dentistry, but instead I get solid dental feedback, a dentist who listens and gets to know his patients.The office is basic to look at, but they have all the latest digital tools and watery ultrasound drills.  My new hygienist really cares about her job and is chock full of tips.  The fact that I floss daily is a bonus for both of us!Dr. Wirth approaches my mouth with a do as necessary attitude and it is just refreshing.  Best of all my husband likes him too, which is a major feat and a double check that I have chosen well.Let me just say my teeth are exceptionally important to me and I need them to keep eating and yelping!
5	Dr. Wirth is simply the best. Even if he has no openings, he will squeeze you in if need be. Friendly, caring dentist and staff that will work with you with regard to payment.
