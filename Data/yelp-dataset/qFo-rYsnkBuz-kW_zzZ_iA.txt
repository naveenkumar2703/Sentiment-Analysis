4	The new poker lounge at the hard rock is actually quite nice. Wednesday night ladies tournament for $20 was a blast. Dealers are fun (and most are hot might I add), atmosphere is great, and the players I met were awesome. I will definitely be back.Minus one star for trying to charge $3 for redbull/energy drinks.. screw you guys for that.
3	Pros:- Decor is excellent, like the rest of the Hard Rock.- Comfortable chairs- In my experience during two tournaments, the dealers were friendly and knowledgeable (accurate), and also there were lots of inexperienced players (one didn't know you could check!)Cons:- Cheap playing cards (papery)- Uncomfortable felt (hard, no "give")- Tournament structure suffers from too many levels early, too few levels latePersonally, overall I would much rather play poker elsewhere until they get some reasonable quality cards and felts.  This is a peeve of mine in poker rooms.
4	Loved making this place a regular hangout!  The staff there was super friendly, and always recognized the regulars.Was glad they had a policy allowing brushes/dealers on dead tables to hop in games to get them going, plus they never just folded around.Nice and convenient, next to the parking garage, and the decor is nice and swanky.I feel the other reviewers harshing on the felt quality... and it only got worse once they started putting the promotional felts down, but you could get used to it.They always did a great job of listening to the player, and their involvement on 2+2 allowed them to get great community feedback and immediately implement it in the room, like the trash talk tuesdays etc.
