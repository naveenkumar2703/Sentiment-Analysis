5	Very nice place. Looks like some construction in the front but that's a cover for their outdoors dining area which is surprisingly very clean and comfortable looking. inside is also really clean. Small bar area with a few different types of liquor, Korean place so obviously a big ass bottle of Crown Royal, Respect, a bottle of jack (WTF?!), bottle of Vodka, and a bottle of Tanqueray 10, as well as assorted Soju, flavored Soju and beers.Omg i cant remember the last time i've had an OB...Food is awesome, but this place is more of a Korean watering hole / hangout spot / watering hole. VERY friendly peopleWill go again for sure, just need a designated driver next time I wanna relive my glory days of 300 dollars worth of soju shots in KoreaUpdateIt's been a month since my last visit. Every now and then i have a huge craving for a Kim Chi stew and an OB. Gotta find new friends all they wanna eat is jack in the box
4	Great place to eat away from the strip - go there early for some good food and quiet place to chat with friends, stay later and you'll get all the clubbing locals.  Food is good, I just wished I didn't eat so much at the buffet, by the time I was there could really order only two dishes.  Very cute waitress there. ;)
5	re open!!! for the love of something very loveable reopen or at least tell me where to find the head chef!!!been months since i had a decent pot of military stew!!!
