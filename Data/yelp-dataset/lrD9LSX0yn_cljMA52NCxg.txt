4	The instructors are extremely professional, they know their business.  The owners are passionate and personable- they really want to help you reach your fitness goals. Prices reasonable.  Lots of equipment for a variety of work outs...
5	James Long and crew are a great team with a great program put together.  Can't say enough good things about Long Life!
5	Great environment to get fit!  I took beginning ballet and it was fantastic.  I miss ballet from my childhood and college.  It's nice to jump right back in with an incredible instructor.  Louisa Long is so fun!  I highly recommend taking classes with her she's fabulous!  I could follow her instruction and she was very attentive to the students.  The pace was great for me, with a little foundation.  The prices are extremely affordable and once my groupon expires I am planning to buy a package for ballet!
5	My daughter currently takes ballet and hip hop dance classes at long life fit and dance. She had taken dance instruction at a bigger dance company before. We love long life dance because here I feel like my daughter gets expert, quality, and professinal instruction without the drama that so often acompanies the competitive dance world. I would highly recommend this studio if your just looking for a class for fun or fitness or if your serious about dance at the competitive level.
