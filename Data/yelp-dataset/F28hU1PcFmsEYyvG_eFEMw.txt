2	Not great food.The place looks quite fun and has coupled with a local bakery next door. Tony was even part of this year's great british menu. Unfortunately I did not enjoy my food. The dessert was clearly old, and not fresh. The 5 different cheese all taste the same -- basically of blue cheese. The starter was really good. The main was ok (a pie), but not very imaginative. I was also a little shocked that there were no fresh/green option on the menu. All options were quite heavy/stew type dishes.The staff is really nice and the restaurant is quite fun. Lots of pigs everywhere, a few quotes on the wall. But the tables are a little sad. The menu is quite cheap, but still. Not good enough!I was expecting much better. Really disappointed :(( Sorry Tony.
2	Style over substance you say? You're not kidding. Yes, yes it's quirky. Yes it has all the little touches to make give you a more enjoyable 'experience'. But when you're going for a cheap lunch (which wasn't actually that cheap, for lunch) you need more than experience. You need good food.Now, I've eaten at Tony Singh's other restaurant - Oloroso. And it was stunning. Everything about the place is spectacular, especially the view of the castle. That really did add to the experience. But it ADDED to the experience, the main part of which was the incredible food. This place seems to have forgotten the main point of a restaurant - food! I had the Chilli Pig Pie. Oh Tony, your names are hilarious. I mean, Chilli Pig Pie! Inspired! Shame about the food - bland, bland, bland. I wanted a real chilli kick, which I didn't get. Boring.
