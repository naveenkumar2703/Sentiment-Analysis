4	Excellent tennis club, attached to a community Tree Top Park. The Tennis club is in the same parking lot of the kids play area
4	Very nice park with lots of fun stuff for the little ones, as well as a lot of seating for adults to watch the kiddos.
3	This is a typical Summerlin park. Clean, well maintained, etc.  What I like about it is you can walk down a trail between housing developments and under a street and come put in Tree Top park!
