5	Being a female and trying to find a company out there you can trust at times is hard. Luckily I found this company that has been around for over 50 years. The building itself is in Scottsdale on Earll, but they will send their Electricians anywhere. I set my boss up with them and he LOVED them (which is hard to do at times;) ) They were on time, gave me quote over the phone and kept the price quote the same, which is rare. They do NOT charge a travel charge like a few companies I talked to. Went to drop off a payment with the company at their local office and the lady there was sooooo nice. What a great company. Would use again!!! Thank you for being honest and taking care of your customers, new and old....
5	I'll keep this short and sweet, but Shields is fantastic and will now be my go to biz when I need an electrician!Very professional, reasonably priced ($75 to hang a chandelier), on time and in and out as quick as can be!Thanks for being so trustworthy!
5	Had some power problems in some areas of the house, Brian isolated and fixed the problem, and it didn't cost me an arm and a leg.  I will call them again for all of my electrical needs.
