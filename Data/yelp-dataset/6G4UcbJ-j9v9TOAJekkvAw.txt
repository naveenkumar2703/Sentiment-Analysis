4	The food is McDonalds quality, you either like it or you don't, but I like that they are fast & hire very nice young people (OMG! Only old people say that, so I must be getting up there, lol). I'm giving them 4 stars because it's always a pleasant experience to go through their drive through :) I do have to add that their speaker was on the fritz & I did let them know. Still, it's not like I wasn't going to drive another few feet & talk to someone in person. At 5 am when I'm prepping for my long drive East, this is really not a big deal, lol. I've been inside & it could probably use a remodeling, but it is what it is!
1	We go here very often cause we work near by. We always send a food runner to pick up food for about 6 of us since we work the night shift. It might just be their night shift but they are always forgetting for peoples food. ALWAYS!
4	It's McDonalds need I say more. Inside is small but the service has always been great.  Don't ask for a Moca in the morning something is always wrong with the machine.  That seems to be the norm. Everything else is great!
1	As our food was being prepared another customer was eating our fries. When the cashier was told about it, the reply was "he didn't know". Is it ok to eat other peoples food off of their trays and make excuses for it? Very disappointed.
2	It is close to home, I love going during the week because the food and service. The service on the weekends is very slow. One night my husband and I went and it was not yet closing hours and as we drove up to the drive in they shut off the lights at the drive in and at the windows. They mix up our orders a WHOLE lot and it seems like we cannot get quality fries they are either old or cold.
