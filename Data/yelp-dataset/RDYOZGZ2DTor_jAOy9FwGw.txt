3	Good food, good prices, and good service.Nothing too "Extreme" about Extreme Pita, except maybe the welcome alternative to a burger and fries.It also has an over-lit, generic, fast-food decor which inhibits digestion.
3	I have to agree with Michael C, there's nothing extreme here.  The food was A-OK and better than McWendyKing's.  I did find the service and presentation fit the mold of other fast food joints and that's not a good thing.One of the guys behind the counter was a persistent up-seller which quickly became annoying.
3	I hang out in this complex a lot (at Gold Bar) and finally broke down and ate here recently.  Here's my thoughts on the whole place.Extreme Pita isn't bad.  It's just not great.  I mean, theres a decent menu, prices are okay, service is mediocre.  But, something about it feels like a subway with pitas.  I got the gyro pita, and it was fine, but it just isnt anything that I would crave/miss food wise.Like Micheal C said, it has an overlit, generic fast food decor feeling to it.  I think he said it best in his review of this place, and pretty much covered how I feel about Extreme Pita.  Go Micheal C!
