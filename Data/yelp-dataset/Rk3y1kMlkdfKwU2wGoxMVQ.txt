5	Hidden away in the corner of a strip mall, Exclusive Tailoring is quite a find!  I have tried different tailor's across the city and they are the best! You get the feeling that you are working with experts which is nice, especially since I have had an expensive suit butchered in the past by another shop.  They gave a couple of my suits a great look and perfect fit.
1	Not good.  They told me they could fix my suit jacket when they couldn't.  The tailor didn't even speak English so who knows what he was telling me.  End result, suit in the trash.  And they still wanted to charge.  If you cant do the job, don't tell me you can so you get the work.  I also asked them to shorten sleeves on a sweatshirt.  They only did one sleeve, and even it wasn't right.   On the same trip, they were supposed to take in the waist on some jeans, they forgot.   If that wasn't enough, the pricing is on par with saks with half the quality.
5	I ain't 't fu*king with anyone else since reading they do work for some of the major retailers/boutiques around town. Great, prompt service I drive across town for these folks. The handful of times I've been there, they have only been honest about what they can or cannot do. I've checked out other places closer to me with good Yelp ratings but found that the communication or language barrier left me incredibly disappointed.Even better news, they are opening a second location by me, the Southeast Vegas area!
5	Took two suits in as I've lost weight. I knew as they were pinning me that they were excellent at their craft. The staff is very friendly. I picked the suits up and they fit better than ever.  I wear suits for work so I took two more in and they were happy to see me back. The attention to detail is outstanding.
