4	The office is clean, efficient when you schedule an appointment, and has later than most LabCorp hours.
5	The ladies here are very welcoming and good at their job.  They only have to "stick you once" and they get the blood they need.  Also, they are very welcoming and the wait time is slim to none.  I live closer to the St. Rose area location, but I wouldn't hesitate to drive up here for service.  Thanks!!
3	I had my blood drawn here for an allergy test recently. The lady behind the counter was ok. She was pretty ambivalent towards me, although very efficient and barely left a bruise. (I bruise easily) I'm terrible at getting my blood drawn, so I always appreciate when the technician is quick. I sometimes faint when I get blood drawn, and when I told her this she said ok. I thought it was a little weird that she left me alone to get out of the chair on my own. I was fine, so it wasn't an issue. This location is close to downtown and open until 6pm which is later that a lot of the other locations. There was only one person a head of me, so I was in and out rather quickly.
1	This place is scuzzy. The bathroom door does not close properly. I had a 8:30 am appointment for fasting bloodwork to be drawn. Not done until 9:15. Only one staff member had shown up that day! Long line of people without appointments. Management obviously puts no money into the upkeep or staffing. Will try not to return to this location.
2	Why do they have to be so slow.
4	I've been using this Labcorp for the last year now and this is the only one I'll go to. The lady at the counter tonight was so nice and I barely felt the prick. The results always come back fast and with good news lol so I'm a happy customer.
