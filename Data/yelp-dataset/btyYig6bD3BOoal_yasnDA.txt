5	This is technically just for the website since I've never been to AZ. They supposedly have a regular retail store. Anyway, the website is very easy to navigate and has a great look to it. I was searching for some inexpensive Juicy Couture items (esp. for pets) and I stumbled across this place. It's run by MLB players' wives. In any case, the website is well-done in the sense that it updates immediately. I bought the last JC collar set and when I checked back later, it was already off the site. This minimizes the need to contact someone back saying that the item is out-of-stock. I opted for regular shipping, which came out to $4.95 for my order (that's cheaper than most shippers on eBay which is where I was also looking for JC stuff) and it was UPS ground. I ordered around 12 on Tuesday, it arrived Friday. Yes! My order even came wrapped with pink tissue. My JC dog tee had a tag, the collar set did not. The items are a bit outdated, from probably a 2006 collection but whatever.I would order again from them. In fact, I'm debating if I want to order the other two tees. A tiny bit too big, but you can't been the major markdown.
