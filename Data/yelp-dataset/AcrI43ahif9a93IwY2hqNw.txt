My hair was cut by Nemi who was entertaining and, like every hair stylist before him, appalled at the length of time I wait in between haircuts. He didn't subject my hair to the trauma of a flat iron, which I appreciated, and worked hard to make my hopelessly unstylish self look a little bit more styled.
