5	We were in Vegas or a 40th birthday party and wanted some cupcakes to celebrate.  This service worked out great.  We had lemon, carrot cake, and maple bacon.  My personal favorite was maple bacon.  Yum!  They also looked great and were decorated beautifully.  Brittany was professional, made recommendations for my order and made sure they were delivered to my hotel on time.  She even made a cute banner for the cupcakes with the birthday girl's name which was a nice special touch.
5	Every thing Brittany bakes tastes amazing, Her cakes and cupcakes are so pretty, her frosting is addicting, great prices and awesome service!
