4	Quicktrip is always my first choice for gas and convenience items. The staff are well trained and the facilities are always spotless. I like that it takes all of 3 seconds to check out and every customer is welcomed when they enter. They have an exceptional assortment of convenience foods from hot dogs to raw almonds. They also carry a great selection of beverages.
