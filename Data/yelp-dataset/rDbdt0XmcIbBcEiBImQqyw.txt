4	Seafood is great and fresh - I had the Ceasar Salad with Crab and it was very tasty.  Others in my group had the Jumpo Shrimp cocktail ( awesome) Crab Cakes ( good but small) and lump crab cocktail - ( very good!)  with Clam Chowder ( Thick and rich) - Overall a nice choice when at the Orleans - dress is casual and service is very good!
4	This oyster bar is a pretty good place. I came here several times with my then-BF. As with most oyster bars around town, it's a small restaurant. I don't think that I ever saw it crowded either. The service is good. The dinner pricing is similar to the Oyster Bar at the Stations casinos- $13.99 chicken scampi, $16.99 gumbo (mmm, I love gumbo!), $19.99 bouillabaisse, $17.99 combo pan roast (BTW my fave oyster bar being Palace Station, which is now open 24/7- yay!). Also available are Po Boy sandwiches. The entrees are served in huge deep bowls- tremendous.Also available on the dinner menu are: Soups- chowders, Appetizers- oysters, clams, dip, shrimp cocktail, crab cakes, ceviche, Salads- cobb, garden, caesar, and Desserts- cheesecake, tiramisu, bamba- fruit & sorbet covered in chocolate drizzle (but if you finish your meal, I doubt that you will get this far!). I always left pretty full, so I didn't get to enjoy dessert, but when you get good seafood, who cares? I want to come here with my husband so I can get his opinion on the best oyster bar in town.
5	Oyster shooters are the shit!
2	Gross. This place has bugs and flies everywhere. I wish we just got up and left but we ended up getting oysters and soup and I probably could have just heated up canned soup. Not good.
