4	I have been going to Alternative Health/Ace Chiropractic now for 3 years but I have known Dr. Tracy for almost 15 years.  Ever since I have moved to the NW valley it has been a great location for me.  Now that Dr. Tracy Peruch has his MD I also use him as my regular physician.  He is great if you would rather not see a western medicine kind of doctor.  Dr. T had my blood work done and found that I needed some natural help to address my high cholesterol and energy levels based off of my blood work.  I no longer take statin medicine for my cholesterol and that is great because I HATE the pharmaceutical companies.  He is also one of the best chiropractors I have gone to.  He always loosens me up well and I tend not to need to see him more than once per month.  He is in the Bashas shopping center (except Bashas closed) but it will say Ace Chiropractic over the door.  Make sure you go in and say that you saw my review on Yelp, all the staff there is really nice and take the time to get to know everyone that goes in there.

5	I have been going to Ace Chiropractic for years for various different services and I love the entire staff and service that I get when I am there.  If you are looking for more natural ways to handle any ailments you may have this is the place to go.  I have been struggling most recently with hormonal issues and Dr. Ramon got me on the pellets and all of the unpleasant symptoms are gone and I feel great.  Along with the variety of services they offer, they also offer massages which are the best I have ever had, so I would highly recommend this company.
