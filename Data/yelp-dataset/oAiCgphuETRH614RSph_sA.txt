5	Best mechanics in Vegas.  They try to find the best solution to car problems, which many times ends up being cheaper than what other mechanics recommend.  I have been taking my car there for a year and completely trust their advice.
5	I like my mechanic to look and act like a mechanic, to have the grease under his fingernails and to know that his primary job is vehicle repair, not sales.   I'm also demanding -- I want a mechanic who can talk to me about the needed repairs in a clear, helpful way without being condescending and without inventing repairs that aren't needed.The Stop Shop is all that and more.  It was first recommended to me by a friend who is a mechanic and classic car buff who said it's the only repair shop in town that he'll send his vehicles to.  After a few visits there with my later 1990s Honda, I can confirm that he was absolutely right.The place is honest and reliable.  The guys working there are just great guys--very friendly and they take the time to show you what's wrong with the car and what they repaired.  They call me "young lady" and I don't mind a bit.  If they aren't 100% sure of what's wrong with the car, they go with the cheapest option first (a rarity in the up-sell world we live in).  Finally, they're great communicators.  They call as soon as the car is ready and call before they do any major repairs.  After working with these guys, I won't take my car anywhere else in Vegas.
5	I'm from california and while visiting Las Vegas my engine check light came on.  I found The Stop Shop on Yelp and decided to give them a try.  Told them what the problem was and they check out the error code.  They couldn't find anything wrong so reset the light and said if it come on again after driving 35 - 40 miles bring it back and they will check it out again.  Best part not only were they professional they didn't charge me to check out the car.  They have my business as long as I'm in Las Vegas.
