5	This is the best apartment complex I have ever lived in. This place is very close to school. Flash bus is free or you can bike it easily. It is not a new complex by any stretch, but it is well taken care of, and managed extremely well. Pam (I hope she's still there) is a decent person as well as being a great manager. My hot water heater went out and it was replaced the same day. Pam even allowed me to use the shower in the model apartment because I had to be at work before my water heater would be replaced. Henry (the maintenance guy) takes care of everything lightning fast. I really have nothing bad to say about any of my experiences here. I've lived in many apartments, and Salado Springs is far and away the best.
4	Great complex to live in!  This is a gem in the middle of what is known as a not-so-great area.  Management keeps the complex clean and well-groomed, and they communicate well with the tenants if anything happens in the complex.  There were a couple burglaries during my time there, but each time I received a note describing the incident, and they even had an officer come to the complex to answer any questions tenants had.  I still personally never felt unsafe.  While this is great for college students, I am a working professional and never felt like I was in a party complex.  I think Management takes care to put tenants with similar lifestyles close together.  It was great running with Tempe Town Lake right outside my door, and the central location is great with easy highway access.  It is under the flight path, so the first few weeks take some getting used to, but after that it's hardly noticeable.
