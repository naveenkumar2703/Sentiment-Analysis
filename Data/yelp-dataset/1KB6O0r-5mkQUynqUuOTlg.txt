5	I'm not good at math, I can't throw ninja stars and I can't fix my iPod. Being Asian only takes you so far in life and sometimes you have to call a professional. I tried to fix my iPod once and I ended up cracking the screen because I tried to pry it apart with a knife. I ended up buying another one. So when a friend of mine, had an older iPod that died on him and wanted to toss it out, I offered to help. No... I wasn't going to try and fix it. I took it to Mac Matters. I've known the owner, Mark Munoz, for several years. He was our bi-weekly Mac maintenance guy at another place I worked for and kept all the equipment running smoothly there. So naturally, I knew that he would be able to help. By the next day, Mark returned the iPod to me and this time it worked. While I glossed over the details, I know that Mark and his team really know Apple products, inside and out. At one point or another, several of them were Apple Geniuses. So if you're looking for trustworthy, knowledgeable people to trust your Apple babies with-- the guys at Mac Matters are the real deal.

5	During a trip to Phoenix, I found myself in need of an older, hard to find part for a Mac.  After visiting a local Apple Store, I was directed to Mac Matters.  Sure enough, they had just what I was looking for, and the price was more than fair.  These guys know their stuff!  The staff is friendly, and they know how to treat a customer.  Thanks for helping me out of a jam!
