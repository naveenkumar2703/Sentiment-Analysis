5	Lumenbrite Training Center offers Adobe training courses in a very professional and friendly environment. The center is well-equipped and staffed by qualified professionals. The course contents are well organized. It is worth spending the time there to learn new stuff.
5	I took a premiere pro course at Lumenbrite in order to fill in the gaps in knowledge as well as expand my ability in video production.  The information was present extraordinarily well and moved at a great pace.  We built a project in the class that had a great deal of real world application and demonstrated a great workflow.  It definitely gave me the know-how to work comfortably in premiere.
