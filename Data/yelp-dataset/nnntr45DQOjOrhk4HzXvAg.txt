5	The place was really busy we I walk into it, but I was still greeted very nicely.  The staff was very friendly, and it was cool to be able to watch them make the ice cream.  I order Chocolate peanut butter cup in a to a go container, a lot of ice cream  :)  When I got home we put the ice cream into the freezer (had to go to the store after), and in a couple of hours we were enjoying very tasty, creamy, and very good ice cream.  We will be back for sure.

I give credit to whomever came up with this novel concept for an ice cream place (unless other ice cream slab places exist.) I've never seen one, and I'm as old as the hills.
