3	This is a decent place it's kind of gloomy but its ok a lot of people though every  weekend unfortunately the hook a sub par
4	This place was amazing! There is no cover charge and the people who work there are very nice. The hookah was amazing, and the party went on all night long. At first the music was mostly latino dance music, but as the night went on they started playing more hip hop and rap songs that were not quite mainstream but well known. I believe they did have a bar upstairs but I was not sure. The atmosphere was up beat and fun and they gave out these sticks that light up. I will definitely return to Midnight Hookah Lounge, and I will tell anyone who asks how much fun it was. If you want to smoke hookah in an upbeat and fun club atmosphere this is the place to go. Its great for dancing as well as for groups.
1	I've been smoking hookah for about 6 years and I can tell when the smoke is good or not. The hookah was horrible, staff was not polite at all and the music was awful. The shisha didn't last more than 15 mins and I had to pay 20 for not even a half hour?? No I will never go back
1	I know hookah and this is shitty hookah ! Was there 5 minutes,tried to get money back and manager was an a-hole and did not refund. I would not recommend this hookah lounge to anybody . This hookah is so rough you cannot even enjoy and there was a sewer roach crawling on the floor . DO NOT GO TO MIDNIGHT HOOKAH!!!
1	This is a horrible lounge to go to, do not go to midnight hookah lounge. I'm a DJ and a music producer and I was supposed to be playing at midnight hookah lounge on the August 29 and the owner of the lounge double booked me and canceled the event that I had put work into and the hookah sucks there. The owner is rude as well.
