2	As much as it filled my need for a transfer, it did only that. So I guess mission was accomplished.However, as nice as the people that work here are this place gives you an impression of disarray and confusion. I am not sure what it is, but I didn't feel too comfortable in here. Everybody seems to be in on every transaction, and that is just weird.Their inventory leaves for something to wish for, no matter what you are looking for. They don't have a lot of anything, nor is it very organized. The few guns they have on display is marked with a price tag and the bare minimum information. I mean, I don't expect there to be all information on a tag - but there needs o be more. I would never go in here and buy something on the fly - that just wouldn't happen. I feel like I am kicking on someone who is laying, but this business is clearly not run very well nor effective.
1	Just a store front with a FFL some place to get a firearm transfer done at    ant the parking is terrible
