1	This restaurant in Ocotillo area  appears to be very poorly managed.  Just moved in to this area and have given this location several visits.The employees can't smile, takes them forever to greet at the speaker,I received the wrong salad - called them from home - mgr said come back mention my name and we will replace the salad for you.  i went back the following evening and they flat out refused  to do anything- sorry we don't if this happened or not- the mgr is off today. Unbelievable!!!very poor training and employees don't care-most likely the mgr doesn't care either.
4	Vanilla Shake and Chicken Nuggets and of course a Mcdouble hamburgers is my JOE's favorite. We come here when we get the opportunity.
5	Great for young children and the staff are always nice. They also have a TV with sporting events being broadcasted in the sitting area by the playground. It's been my only opportunity to keep up with basketball this year.
1	This is a story about "going the extra mile"...Which is exactly what I do when I drive an "extra mile" down the road to a different McDonald's location, instead of going to this, closer, more convenient one.EVERY single time I have gone to this location they have messed something up. Wrong orders, forgotten items, miss-charged credit cards, are just a few of the things that this collection of knuckleheads consistently excels at. Save yourself some frustration, and go the extra-mile...down the road.
1	Been here several times.  They always mess up my order, especially at the drive-thru.  Skip this one and drive 3 minutes north to the McD's at Alma and Queen Creek. It's much better.
