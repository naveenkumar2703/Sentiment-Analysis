4	Clean and organized, found some cheap items that I was looking for.
4	This Dollar Tree was MUCH better then others I have tried in the area. The location was twice the size of two others I've been to, and the choices were more plentiful.  I was striking out on the Halloween decorations at Dollar Tree - which was my go to place in Orlando for seasonal decor - so I was pretty bummed about it.  However, this one was the winner and helped to set me up for some cute desk deco!I was able to find several items to my liking for our office theme since they had more options overall (I'm guessing since they were a larger location in general).  I am considering stopping back by this one to stock up on a few more things now that I have the decor started on my desk and I have more ideas!Overall: ABigger location.  More options.  Everything is still only $1.
3	The most interesting thing about this Dollar Tree was that it was mobbed right after opening on Sunday morning.Otherwise, it's just kind of there, not as big as the one on Thomas by Walmart and Home Depot, and far from the vast marvels of the one at University and Lindsay in Mesa. If you need a Dollar Tree right now, it'll probably do, though.
