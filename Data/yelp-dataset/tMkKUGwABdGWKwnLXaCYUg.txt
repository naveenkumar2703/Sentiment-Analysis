1	Shitty drive thru service!! Asked for a Chicken quesadilla and got a burnt quesadilla with onions in it!! Employees need more training.
1	I just went to Taco Bell and when I ordered my tacos, I was informed of their new policy to not serve a cup of water.  I could buy a bottle of water or pay for a soda, but they will no longer provide a free cup for water, even with a paid meal.  Taco Bell, you have lost me and my co-workers as customers.  Goodbye.
3	So kids, if you've been following along at home, you know Uncle Georgie thinks most fast food places can only strive for a 3 Star rating or worst. Uniformity at fast good places in my opinion make it impossible to offer a Four Star, or Eccck... a Five Star rating. Sorry, Yum Brands!  But this isn't a ghetto location and the employees aren't brain dead. On the contrary, they're all very nice and friendly. Especially Mallory up front and Becky the Manager who went out of their way. Nice!As for the food, it's okay. The Tacos were good, as for the cheese Pizza Hut pizza, while being slightly undercooked it was also A-Okay. BTW, I had no problems getting a cup for water. So that must have been an isolated incident the other reviewers had on their visit. So Three Stars, A-Okay
