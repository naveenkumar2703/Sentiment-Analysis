3	Found the guys at Weiss Guys to be efficient. Now my car is all shiny and I'm a happy customer.
4	I've been coming here for years. This place is way better than the other car washes in this area. The vacuums are ok, could use a little extra suction power. The service is fast though and someone actually hand dries your vehicle. Great little place to wash your car.
4	Stopped in for a wash after long drive from Illinois.  I spent $9.00 for a wash.  It was worth it. The human touch drying the car was nice.  I definitely recommend it.
5	Super nice employees! Able to answer car care questions and are very pleasant. My kids had stuffed some smashed crackers in between the seats and center console and the vacuum wouldn't reach. The managers very kindly allowed the car wash guys to use their air hose to dislodge to crumbs and gave me a token to finish the job. The shampoo for the carpets actually smells nice and was a good price. Easily saved over $100 by not taking it to a detail shop and my car looks like new. If you have leather seats, bring your own seat cleaner, it's the only thing the shop doesn't have. My new favorite place to detail my car!!
