4	Pho Pasteur & Grill is one of the newest Vietnamese cuisine restaurants to open its doors to customers in Las Vegas. It is located in the Westwind Centre strip mall on Spring Mountain Road, next to Marnee Thai restaurant and across the street from two $20/hour reflexology/foot spa locations.In spite of the chilly weather, I was the only customer there the entire time I ate my extra large order of Pho Dac Biet ($9) at an extra leisurely pace.  I thought it was good, and not excessively salty. They have a large menu of items (from traditional Vietnamese pho restaurant offerings to Chinese), some of them even have photos on the wall to help those not familiar with Vietnamese and Chinese cuisine in narrowing down their potential menu selection.The staff was efficient and my order came our after just two or three minutes.  The place is also clean, including the restaurant's restroom. Which is always nice.There are a lot of Vietnamese pho restaurants in the area, but I will come back and explore their menu further.
3	So I have been traveling around Pho Central and sampling the spicy noodle soup called "Bun Bo Hue"..... This version here is a bit oily, and lacks the robust flavor "punch" it's supposed to have and is a bit low on the spicy scale, especially since i ordered it more spicy.  the goi cuon rolls were the same as usual and I also tried the soda chanh: lime juice with sugar and club soda which was fizzled out, (not much bubbles).  I have yet to try the actual Pho here and they do have lunch specials for $5.99 w/ soda or tea.... so we shall see...banzaiiiiiii.....C
