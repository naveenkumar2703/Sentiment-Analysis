5	This is the best cleaners around for the price. I've been a regular for a long time now. I've had a number of hiccups but Steve the manager is the guy that ALWAYS make things right. Steve is awesome! Don't pay attention to the douchebag that only gets on yelp to write negative reviews. I'd recommend this place to anyone. They do a good job with normal drycleaning and my laundered shirts. But formals isn't their thing...
1	You get what you pay for... sometimes. I dropped off a few shirts and pants last week and when I went to pick them up, a shirt was missing. Steve claimed it had been "held"  though it simply needed basic dry cleaning. He then said "they do this to me all of the time."  When I took my duvet cover in, it took a week and a half longer to return than promised. Overall, very little lack of empathy for their mistakes and poor customer service.
1	They are happy not to help. I would stay away unless you want your things to go missing. Steve the manager has no clue.
5	Great place for the price! When ever there's a problem, Steve the manager is on top of it.. It's great for every day drycleaning. But not so much formal stuff.  I've been going there for a long time and have had a number of hiccups. Steve always makes it right! Seeing other negative comments from ignorant people just makes me laugh.
1	Very bad cleaners. I use to love this place. I mainly went to their Ray location though. All their good workers are gone now. This place has issues but usually made up for it with cost and the quick turnaround. But with their other location going downhill so quickly this year, I've finally had enough.
