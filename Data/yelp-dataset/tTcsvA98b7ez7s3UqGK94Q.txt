4	She has moved out-of-state now.  CLOSED!!!Found this lil nail studio through a Living Social deal. It was the 1st I'd ever bought and probably the last I'll get.  They didn't warn this poor shop owner to put a cap on her offer so she was swamped by customers and it took months to get in for an appt.  And she's the only one working there!That being said, the pedicure was a good one.  Too bad she moved a matter of weeks after my appt.Won't see you there.
5	One of the best pedicures I've ever had!
1	Horrible!  I echo what others have said.  I also purchased a deal through Living Social and I have tried calling several times and leaving a message.  No return call.  I also have not received my pedicure and the deal expired!  In my opinion, that is like stealing my money.  It isn't like I didn't try to set up an appointment.  And I understand if she is overbooked but honor the people who purchased the deal and maybe extend the expiration deal.  Or at least return your calls!  Unfortunately, I think this backfired and I will never go to her, whether or not she is good and will tell everyone I know not to try her.  Customer service goes a long way, people.
