4	Yay! I'm a fan! Jk... well I do really like the styles they have for men. They have from what I've heard, some of the most comfortable dress shoes there are. They can be slightly pricey at department stores... I've bought three pairs so far for my dad for Christmas; yes he is now a converted Ecco loving fan! Styles at the outlet can be hit or miss with the stuff on sale, but they have some classic looking styles and great styles but the markdown just isn't as high.
3	They recently relocated inside the outlet mall to a much larger location by the food court.The bummer here is they dont carry any youth size clothes or shoes. They referred me to Skechers to buy the shoes and I've found a few Size Small t-shirts on sale for $9.99 ea.Nice adult selection with fairly decent prices.
4	Cannot remember his name but the sales associate who track down a pair of shoe I wanted and didn't stop until he located it at another store and had "Daisy" hold it for me. Thank you! That was great customer service!!
