4	Not their largest location, but I LOVE this location.  Has great items and the stafff is SUPER nice.  So easy to go shopping here.There is a little of everything here, consignment and new items and everything is at very competitive pricing.
5	I've been buying furniture from Colleen for 15 years.  As she grows, her selection grows but her prices stay low.  I love all the picture frames at this location.  They have a lot of smaller stuff here for the house.
5	great store! lots of interesting and unique stuff at great prices.
2	OVERPRICED.  There was a lot of furniture in the store and the owner was friendly enough.  But a lot of it was OUTDATED and overpriced. Most of it was in good to fair condition but I saw a white sleigh bed that was not in the best condition and they were charging as much as my daughter just bought hers for new.  And my daughter's bed was a better brand name and nicer.  After going there I figured I could find it cheaper through Craigslist or a yard sale.  I visited another consignment store an hour later and found much better deals.  I can't remember the name of it but it was in the Centennial shopping area.  Times are tough... who wants to pay this much for used and outdated furniture???
