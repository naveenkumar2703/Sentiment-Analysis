5	I have attended the Pain Institute of Nevada for a year now and couldn't be more happier for the quality of care that I receive. The staff are very friendly and attentive to the patients and really want the best for them.
5	Best docs ever!  Doc K is a leading expert in Pain Management and is fantastic!  Doc Jarrett makes my back feel like a million bucks!!  Doc K's schedule gets full pretty quick so make sure you get on the books for an appointment.  Unfortunately his day doesn't have much "wiggle room".
5	Dr Kidwell and his professional staff are excellent. They are friendly and well organized. They really show that they care about your health.
