5	We have visited the DreamBank for kids events on the weekends and I have also attended various seminar and classes for adults here.  Different exhibits to help visualize your dreams and play with that idea.  Grab a dream key and put it in the vault or take home to help you focus on your goals.  Kid friendly, super polite and attentive staff/ dream curators.Vibe/ atmosphere is fun, friendly, stay and hang out for a coffee, listen to a speaker or sit in on a class, play with the cool touch screen TV's and get inspired.NIcely finished interior & clean bathrooms.Our kids always want to come here.Totally new type of venue you should definitely check out!
5	It's high time I write a review for one of my favorite Capitol businesses. And given the number of workshops I've attended and the fact that these fine folks insure my home and car, it should come at no surprise that they are 5 stars through and through. What an awesome space to have in our community, chock full of resources, education and ways to deeper connect with friends and neighbors. I hope this space nets them the return on their investment of building out this beautiful historic space, I'd hate to see them close up shop in a few years.
