4	This is a wonderfully modern and BIG office. I believe there are 5-7 OB's in the practice so you have plenty to choose from. Just beware if you pick a popular one, their case load is huge and they probably won't remember you from the next gal. Overall a good office with great doctors!
1	DO NOT GO HERE!After two months of going back and forth with their billing manager, I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED so awful!THEY WILL CHARGE you $$ for things not disclosed or discussed. I saw the Dr for a good 4 minutes and now I am getting screwed.  FOLLOW MY ADVICE GO TO  Valley Women for Women OBGYN or any others...  this place is not professional and you will end up with hefty bills that are not disclosed.
2	I also had the same experience as another reviewer on here, not good. I was sent to the new Chandler location, though. I ended up with a huge bill and I was supposedly "in network" with great insurance that I've never had a problem with. The doctor had a bad bedside manner too, which I found weird. They spent 5 minutes in the little room with me and referred me out which costed even more. I will be finding a doctor that does more extensive testing in-house and doesn't play the "referral game" to help their specialist buddies and empty your pockets. The only good thing I can say (that got them 2 stars) is the flexible last minute scheduling.
4	I have been going to Contemporary Care for Women for many years. My Doctor is Dr. Lepetich and I really like him.  I have also seen a couple other docs and PA's there as well over the years.  I will say, I much prefer the Gilbert location over the Tempe location.  I seem to wait a lot longer at the Tempe location.  I would not hesitate to refer anyone to this practice and especially Dr. Lepetich.
