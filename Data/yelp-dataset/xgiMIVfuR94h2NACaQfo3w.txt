3	It's Little Caesars, so it's nothing extra special. Off to the side on Guadalupe, the place is at least filled with friendly staff, and they are quick with the orders.
2	I was a long-term regular customer here. My biggest complaint at the time was that they used too much corn starch and big pieces of it coated the bottom of the pizza and the box. Then, they decided to stop carrying banana peppers. I tried repeatedly to contact the manager to no avail. The employees suggested going to the location on Rural Road at Ray Road. I now go there regularly and the quality is actually better.
3	HNR Pepperoni pizza.  Although I don't feel this is the best pizza, for $5.00 ya get what you pay for.  Quick, hot, and convenient meal for at least two adults.  It's not the Little Ceasars Pizza that I grew up with, but in a pinch it's a good go to.Location is easily accessible,  staff is polite and knowledgeable,  transaction simple and quick.Two (2) stars for pizza quality + four (4) stars for location and staff rounds it out to three (3) stars.
