5	Just awesome!  Everything you need to hitch your trailer. The guys there are knowledgeable and helpful. A great experience for those who know nothing about trailers.
4	A few years ago I was searching the Internet for hours.  I needed a hitch for my Ford Escape.  After a few hours and a few days.  I finally made a phone call in town.  I don't know why I didn't do this earlier.  I googled and found Trailer Tech.  I gave them a call and asked for a quote on the hitch.  They beat the Internet price by at least $40.  I also was happy to support a local business.  I went over and ordered the hitch and got it in a few days.  Let's fast forward to just recently.  I now needed a hitch for my Ford F150.  I made a phone call because the price was great for the Escape.  I got my quote and again it was really competitive to the Internet prices.  This is why I really like this place.  The guys behind the counter are always friendly and there to help.  I cannot tell how many  places similar to this business where the counter guy was condescending and looked at you like you were idiot.  Not these guys.  There is no attitude. They want to get you the part you need and help you with any questions.  I always get top notch service and a great price here.  If you need a trailer part or a trailer hitch this is place to go.  Cheers!

I brought in brake components to replace and they looked at them to make sure I actually needed to replace them, got the parts and got rid of the old, greasy nasty parts so I didn't have to load it back into my car. Even loaded my car for me and went back and got me the user/installation manual. Awesome!
