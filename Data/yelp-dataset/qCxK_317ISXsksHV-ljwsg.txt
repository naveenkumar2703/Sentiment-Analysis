4	The name Assembly has become synonymous with Edinburgh Fringe. Now in its 30th year at the festival it's as big as its every been. They seem to have all the biggest stars and best shows, and with venues like this is not difficult to see why.The walk up to the venue is worth it even if you don't go and see and show. Separating Old and New Town, the top of The Mound has spectacular views over Edinburgh - especially good if you don't have the energy to walk up Arthur's Seat or Carlton Hill but still want to take in your surroundings.Inside, there's a sort of indoor/outdoor bar not dissimilar to the Lane Bar on George Street. It's in a big courtyard, with the bar on one side and tables on the other. Then there are three venues: The Bailie Room, Rainy Hall and the festival's former biggest venue - Assembly Hall, which seats more than 800. It's a really good venue but it could probably do with another bar and more toilets. And many, many less pillars in the Assembly Hall.
4	The Assembly Hall is much cooler as the Assembly Hall than it is as the Divinity College, I assure you. Mainly because the latter requires that you be there for knowledge early in the morning, whereas the latter requires that you be there for fun and comedy and dance and music in the late night with beer and friends and fun and etc (insert here above list). The Divinity College is a really beautiful building (for all I know it's also called New College, but I might be making that much up) and it turns into a pretty decent venue too. Two summers ago, I was lucky enough to be able to see Bale de Rua (Brazilian dance group) and Ed Byrne in this venue. And even though it was fairly outrageously priced, they were very good shows.
