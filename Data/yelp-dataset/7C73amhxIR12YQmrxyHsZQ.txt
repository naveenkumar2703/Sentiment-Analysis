5	Mandie, now of Amanda Red is fantastic.  From our very first meeting with her we felt at home and very comfortable.  Our package included the engagement session which was fun and she was a great sport showing us a few places in town (we are new to Madison) and allowing us to take her to a few of our favorites.  On wedding day is when it really drove home how valuable she is.  The photography is beautiful but she and her assistant Nick became friends and close confidants.  When someone would ask us a question, we could look at her for the answer.  When it was time to get away from folks she was quick to wisk us away and capture the private moments.  When family photos came along, she was in charge of some very strong personalities and had control of the situation, getting every photo WE, the couple, wanted.  I know if we had to do it all over again, we wouldn't want to do it without Mandie.  Thank you for everything, the sneak peak photos are stunning and I know the album will be stunning.  Thank you for your professionalism, timing and friendship.  Folks, if you are looking for a photographer, hire Mandie, you won't regret it.
5	Mandie did the wedding pictures for my wife and I's wedding in December of 2013. Our package included a engagement session which my fiance and I did in New York City. Mandie worked with us to figure out a time that worked with her travel schedule and she hired a assistant in NYC to be with us for the day. We had a blast exploring the city with Mandie and being her subjects for a day. On the wedding day Mandie was very organized and did a great job helping us move through the day using the photography schedule we had discussed prior to the wedding. Her assistant Nick was equally as impressive, they make a great team. From the photos we have seen so far, she took great wedding shots for us. The investment for high quality wedding photography such as Mandie's is well worth it.
