5	It's a mortuary. They're two minutes away from Woodlawn Cemetery.We had services for my grandmother here.5 stars because there's no reason to give them anything less.
1	While recently attending a service at this location I was appalled at the workers discussing their problems loudly while we awaited the casket being lowered, the worker then proceeded to dump the dirt on our beloved and jump onto the casket and stomp up and down, they then had us wait while they had to go and get more dirt and then watch again while they stomped up and down. I have been to a few funerals over the years but this was terrible !!
5	Andre did a wonderful job helping my family through the hardest thing we have ever had to do. I am very grateful to him and the service that he provided.
