4	I stopped by this store on my way to an appointment.  I really like these stores.  I ended up with two pairs of pants, 3 blouses, a coat and some lacy stockings.  Sonya was very helpful and the selection was great.  I usually shop at the Kierland one, but I was in this part of town, so I am glad I stopped by.
