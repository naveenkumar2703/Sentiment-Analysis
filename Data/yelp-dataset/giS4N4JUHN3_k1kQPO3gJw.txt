5	Great group shows at this place. Gallery sitters/owners always available to help with any questions.
5	Oh, Blackbird -- how do I love thee! This little hidden gem is off the beaten path of most First Friday galleries, so you're likely to miss it if you get distracted by the food trucks, petting zoo, and 9 million other non-art related things that are now part of First Friday.  But that would be your loss.  Because there is some great art here! The gallery hosts a new themed show every month (Dec 2012 is Grimm's Fairy Tales and is SO worth a trip), plus a few other artists doing their own thing.  The gallerist, Gina, is such a wonderful supporter of up and coming artists, and these shows are a great opportunity to catch the new folks on the scene.  And if you're into purchasing some works, I've found some amazing pieces at incredible steals and also some dream pieces that are way out of my price range for now.  Non-pretentious, friendly atmosphere, and usually even parking spots nearby!  Now open for Preview Thursday!
5	The greatest local gallery there is. A good place to showcase the local talent. When you step into Blackbird you step into a gallery that makes you feel completely welcome and part of their little artist family. It will keep you coming back during the week to hear some of the indie musicians that also perform shows here. I miss this place!
5	Wonderful little gallery featuring some great local artists. That alone has me sold. I really appreciate the curator's efforts to find Vegas talent. It's nice that it's a small space as to not get overwhelmed by a large collection. 6/7 pieces does it for me anyway!
