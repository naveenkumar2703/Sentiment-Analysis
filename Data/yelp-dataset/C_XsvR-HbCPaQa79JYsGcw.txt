1	Giving this one star only because the guys who actually worked on my landscape project were really good.  I suspect that there is no real knowledge of landscape or plants behind the desks.  They talked about "working with" me and "making everything beautiful".  The brochures talk about commitment to "your" personal taste and their "expertise".  Not true.  Talk is cheap, watch out for empty promises.I think somebody bought a landscape app and went to a marketing class.  Not the quality, care or artistry that this company used to have.  EXTREMELY overpriced for the end product.
1	It's too bad yelp does not allow zero stars. They did my landscape plan around 8 years ago. I don't recall asking for a big tree that sits next to the pool and dumps 4 pounds of leaves into it daily. The proof is in the outcome ... Which was awful. Avoid this company
5	Andre has been doing our landscape for years. Between planting and maintenance, they've always done a good job.
