5	I LOVE IT! Visited as a tourist, and seriously this staff was SO HELPFUL. I loved going in there.  I got the lower priced Viva La Juicy perfume, cuz I couldn't really afford the big one, the guy showed me the lower priced option, and I bought it, cuz I love Juicy! So yay! Great staff, don't be scared, go in there. Clean store. lots of cute stuff. check it!
4	Located in the Caesars Forum Shops the staff is so helpful. They even helped out my Boyfriend as he was looking at some watches also. The staff likes to strike up a conversation with you about what you are wearing  or where are you from. Not about the merchandise. I felt comfortable about it like I'm not pushed to buy something I didn't want. But hell I did bought a big handbag that was on sale for $89.99 with tax it came out to be $97.00. Not bad but!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!............................I comeback the very next day to buy my Mom a gift and bought something else for me also. I got complimented on my nails and told the Sales Associate on how I did my nails. This is the first Juicy Couture store where I felt like family so to speak. I left my heart in this store. Oh yeah this place is big also with cool sales rack in the back is were is at ya'll.
4	I never shop at this store...not sure why, but I happen to step in while I was waiting for someone.  I was presently surprised.  I never really looked at their clothes or accessories and I was impressed with there cute T-shirts, scarfs & jewelry.  What made this such a good experience was the sales girl.  She was to friendly and cheerful, she said we are having a great sale right now and took me right to the sales area...and great sale prices.  I came out with 2 super cute T-shirts and earrings.  We have a store in Scottsdale, that I need to definitely check.  Cute stuff for birthdays!
4	I stumbled across this location while shopping at BEBE. Staff was nice. Selection was meh, but I managed to buy a velour suit for $45. Not a bad deal.
