2	Never have gotten a good deal with these guys. Which is sad, I like their thin crust pizzas with all the meats, but this one seems to be way overpriced, so when that happens I search elsewhere, forget they screwed me, end up over in their parking lot and see their sign. My stomach over rides my brain and says 'thin crust' and i place an order (giving them another chance) nope... Screwed again, shame on me as I put my wallet in my pocket and now review this place as I wait. First as a warning for you my friends, but mostly as a reminder for myself that I'm an idiot for trying them again
2	If your lookin for a good price, and not so much quality, then yea. This is definitely the place for you. Unless you are drunk, then I'm sure it tastes awesome.I've never had a good pizza from here, the toppings fall off before you can even pick to your slice.We usually pick up our own pizza since its on the way, but the pizza seems like its been sitting out longer than the allotted 25 min.Also, the chicken *poppers* are more like chicken nuggets, and not tasty at all.
1	You really have to make an effort to find worse pizza.  Mediocre meats and veggies are placed under the cheese, making for a soggy, unappetizing pie.  I don't eat fast-food pizza often, but I have tried all the chains, and Papa John's is the worst of the bad.  Do yourself a favor and find a locally-owned restaurant that doesn't aspire to be the Wal-Mart of pizzerias. You'll find plenty on Yelp.
1	Worst service ever! Apparently their online service was down? An hour later their pizza did not arrive, no phone call, no pizza ... Nothing. . .  And a charged credit card. Horrible. Called the closest store to find out they cannot deliver. And my card will still be charged. NEVER AGAIN will I order from papa johns... I suggest you don't either
