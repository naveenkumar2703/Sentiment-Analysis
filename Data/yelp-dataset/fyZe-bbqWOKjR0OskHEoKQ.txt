5	Boars Head meats and cheeses .... Salads are great and burgers are the best by far .... Yummy
2	Second time here and for sure my last. My first visit I was the second order in the window and it took 15 minutes for my sandwich. Today I was the 3rd in the window and it took 30 minutes. 30 MINUTES for a sandwich?! It's in a fast food court for petes sake. And my sandwich came out looking like a sloppy joe and wasn't even made how I asked. I ate it anyways in fear it would take another 30 to fix it. Now I'm suffering from a stomatch ache. Ps they eat while they work, sanitary? Never again!
1	The sandwich I ordered was worth about 1/3 of what I paid for it. Nothing special, bland and boring.
5	Had the egg and cheddar panini. Wow really good! Totally fresh with none of that fast food plasticity you find at so many other chains. Great coffee as well. Nice discovery!
5	I highly recommend you this place! 1. Friendly and professional staff2. Super clean place3. Big menu with really good and healthy choices 4. Different from what you can find at fashion show mall's food court 5. Reasonable prices As a employee of the mall I will for sure go back to this place, I highly recommend it to all the mall employees they even offer employee discount!
