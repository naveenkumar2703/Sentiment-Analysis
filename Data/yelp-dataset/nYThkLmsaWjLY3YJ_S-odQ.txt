4	At this park, they have a fitness course, tennis courts, basketball, a walking course, a kids playground, bathrooms (thankfully), and a nice picnic area.I've been here on leisure and for a birthday party. It is very nice. I especially like the big, wide open area. It isn't overcrowded and the park is kept clean. There are lots of fun to be had at this park.
4	How did I not know this park was here? I noticed the kids play area a few times from the road but thought it was part of the school nearby.The grassy area is really large for such a small park. The children's area is gated so your little tikes can't get away and keeps dogs and weirdos out.Park has bathroom facilities and water fountain. Charcoal grills. Some benches, picnic tables under a pavilion. A tennis court and fitness course for the active folk. Close to busy streets but far enough to feel safe from cars zooming by.
1	This place sucks for me, I don't have kids, nor do I play tennis or even have a dog to walk here. F**k this place, I want Holyfield!
5	Awesome place for jogging they have 2 tennis courts and a basketball court. A lot pet owners. Decent playground for kids.
