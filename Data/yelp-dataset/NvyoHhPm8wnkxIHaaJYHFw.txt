5	This is the best gas station/c-store I have ever seen! They have a MASSIVE drink station with a wall of lids across from it, tons of fresh and hot grill snacks, ample registers always open to speed you on your way, and usually about 20 gas pumps out front. This is how ALL other gas stations should should be set!
5	Always clean, super friendly staff, and this place has anything you could ever want of the junk food variety.
5	Best convenience store ever , they need a few items like more magazines and better smoke prices but they have rooster booster in fountains for cheap so they win me over
5	By far the cleanest gas stations ever. No matter where you go, they're all clean, friendly, and even in the middle of the night the safest place to get gas. Too bad their drinks are the most expensive, almost 50 cents more than Circle K.
5	By far one of the cleanest gas stations I have ever seen this place is clean and has very friendly staff anything you want they have it inside
5	Clean bathrooms.  Friendly service.  Great drinks.  Winning.
