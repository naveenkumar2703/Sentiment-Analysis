5	We were visiting Scottsdale and staying in the hotel across the street and were fortunate enough to stumble upon Valley of the Sun Violins. A small, clean shop with many beautifully kept, OLD, violins that I wish my daughter could have played all day! Angelo, the owner, was quite helpful and knew music people in our area of Florida so were able to chat for a while! Though my daughter has been playing for several years there is always more to learn and Angelo was very generous with good advice! He even invited us to come the next day to play for as long as we wanted! Would happily go here again if we were closer. :O)
5	I've been to other shops around in Tempe and definitely have decided this one is the best. Since the first time I walked in, as a complete novice, he (can't remember his name) took the time to answer all my questions and in a way I could understand the terminology.I also brought my violin to get it checked out and just as the first time he was very patient and answered all my questions. He didn't seem to mind that I didn't buy the violin from him, questioned my violin, criticized, or in anyway frowned upon my violin, which it seems others shops would since I didn't spend a fortune on it. I'll be bringing it in soon to get it adjusted. Overall a great shop.  They made a lifetime customer.
5	Super friendly owner, very personable and shoots you straight. Prices are reasonable and not over sold. Come check out there sale! The biggest selections of cellos in the valley I have ever seen. Talk to Angelo he will give you the best advice on your needs.
