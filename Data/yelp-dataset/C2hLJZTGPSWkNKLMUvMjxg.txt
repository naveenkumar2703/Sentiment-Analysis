3	I've never eaten here, but I've been here to see the scads of local bands that descend on the ER every weekend.  It's not one of my favorite venues, but it's not horrible either.  A giant mural of John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, and Henry Rollins by Danny Bennett decorates the back wall.  This place can get pretty crowded by the youngins with bands are playing, but it's a decent venue so that's understandable.  Drinks are reasonably priced.  Not a completely special place, but worth going if there's an act you want to catch.
3	Hmmm I would go here for their Jam sessions on Tuesday nights. I came here for a few local bands playing a couple times too. Definitely a locals bar. I wonder if Grumpy still runs the bar. I like this place. Booz is inexpensive and it's not really intimidating. The seats aren't as greasy as they used to be. It's a good thing this isn't a real emergency room. Cuz that would be gross. Definitely good band place - plus the seating isn't for "bottle service". It's funny because they are starting to market more. Yea...myspace... nuff said.
1	Caught a local music show here. I would have to agree with a previous review on here. Newbies not welcome, too many drunks ( it just screams out "drunken brawl" to me). I wasnt too thrilled with this joint. The only good thing about this place was the painted backdrop on the stage.
