5	Even though I'm giving 5 stars, recently when a young dark haired guy has been working, he would be stocking shelves or maintaining drink dispensaries, and there will be a line of 2-3 people at the unmanned check out registers. I find this very unusual. He was also not that friendly. I hope management reads this and makes some improvements regarding customer service at this store.
4	This QT is big, clean, spacious, with great stock and really easy to get from/to the highway.  Hard to know it's even here if you're on the highway, but it's one of the most convenient gas/stores on this stretch of SR-101.  Always fast service too.
4	Great location w/prepared hot food & shakes. Very busy as it is convienciwnt lay located off of the 101, this also explains why the bathrooms are ok sometimes.
5	Place ain't to bad.  Reminds me if sheetz back in Virginia.  Has food to order and pretty friendly staff.
