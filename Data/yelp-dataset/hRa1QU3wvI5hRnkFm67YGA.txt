5	I wish I could remember the name of the lady that cut my hair.  It was the fastest, better looking haircuts I have ever had.  She didn't try to make small talk, which I really appreciated.  She cut my hair in about 7 minutes flat!
5	Usually take a chance with other Supercuts..but this place was clean, modern, and most importantly I got a great haircut.  Darci totally listened to what I wanted and did it quickly and beautifully.  Went late morning Monday..No Wait..and the best $15.00 haircut.  Next time, plan on taking advantage of their color.
5	Great staff, Great customer service, Great hair cuts!  The experience is as wonderful as the cut. They really took the time to understand and cut my hair the way I wanted it done. Wow! -Keep up the Great work team.
1	Terrible haircut. She took only about 10 minutes to cut my hair and it looked uneven. I then told her and she said that's just the way my hair was. Now I have to go back to get it fixed. I would never pay any amount to get my hair cut there again.
