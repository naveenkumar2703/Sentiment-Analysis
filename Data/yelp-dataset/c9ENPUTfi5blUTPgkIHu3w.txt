4	I came here with my boyfriend for some late night grubbin. I just drove to Vegas from California. It was late, and I was starving! We decided to dine here because we always pass it when going to my house and the beaming neon sign told us it was open.  When we first walked in, we didn't see anybody. There was no one that greeted us, not even anyone at the bar. We figured they must be closing, so we walked out. As we were getting into our car, the bartender ran out and asked us if we were trying to eat there. We said yes and he told us to come in and that he was just in the back when we walked in. They serve breakfast from 10pm-noon and the prices range from $3.25 (oatmeal) to $6.50 (steak and eggs). We already knew we wanted steak and eggs, so we ordered it right away. It's a pretty good deal. You get a 7 oz. New York steak served with two eggs, cottage fries and toast for only $6.50. As we waited for our meals, we perused through the menu. There's about 10 items on the breakfast menu including country fried steak, steak n eggs, hot cakes, build your own omelet, biscuits n gravy, oatmeal, a breakfast special with 2 eggs/your choice of meat/toast/cottage fries, french toast, and a protein plate. It pretty much has everything you need for a great breakfast and for cheap!We got our dishes. They were decently portioned and the meat was well cooked and tender. I really enjoyed the cottage fries with some ketchup and the eggs were nice and fluffy. This is a great place for some cheap breakfast or a late night bite!
5	One of my absolute favorite bars! When I've got a few dollars to spare and want bar food, this is where I go. Domestic bottles are priced around $2.50 if I remember correctly and their Reuben sandwich is made just the way I like it!  Mon-Thurs the Hawaiian bartender (Pono is his name I think?) is there. He's really courteous and has yet to let me go more than a minute without a cold beer.Also, had the stromboli the other night. It was HUGE. Had to be atleast 6" wide and 12" long, and that's the *small*. Ended up splitting it with a friend it was so big.
4	**Summary**       - Flavor - I like the cottage potatoes over regular boring hash browns. Steak and eggs quality wise, it's one of the best for under $8.       - Value - They have some pretty good food for such a cheap price. The best value is from 10pm to noon the next day where they have the breakfast specials and the $6.50 steak and eggs. The deals during the regular hours aren't bad either.**Price**       - $6.50 7 oz. steak and eggs**Recommendations**       - I'd recommend this place for a cheap, yet quality late night or morning meal.
3	My boss wanted to go to T-Bird Lounge one day for lunch because he was tired of the same old lounges we tend to frequent. T-Bird is exactly what I expected when I walked in... dim lighting, only a handful of patrons, and the only employee we saw was the bartender... So we sat at the bar.  I had the sliders, which were very yummy. Some of the better bar sliders I have had recently. My boss ordered a beer, so I tried to order jager with Red Bull, but they don't carry Red Bull at T-Bird. I didn't catch the name of the energy drink the bartender substituted, but it was actually quite good. We played a little video poker and blackjack.. And for once I came out ahead!! Only $4 but I play conservative bets and usually don't win anything, so I left happy. Overall, it's a decent spot to check out if you are in the area...  In a city with an excessive amount of bars and lounges, it didn't really stand out to me, so I wouldn't make a special trip to try it...
4	NEW YORK STEAK & EGGS 7 oz. New York steak served with two eggs, cottage fries and toast.Wait. for ONLY $6.50???? oh my god! I'M SOLD! Soo yummy!! Served from 10PM to Noon Everyday!!
4	I'm not a "bar food" kinda person, but this place is close to my house so I decided to give it a try. So far we've had the sliders which are awesome, the pizza (thin crust) surprisingly awesome, and breakfast for around $5 which was way better that most casino breakfasts for a fraction of the price. Also the bartenders are super friendly every time we've been in. It's close, it's quick, it's cheap, now I just wish they'd deliver!
3	Probably the cheapest video poker tavern bar food in the Blue Diamond/Enterprise area. It's a good value but you get what you pay for, as most of the food is unremarkable, if well portioned.The chicken fingers are so-so, but the assortment of sauces offered with them helps. I went with the hot buffalo. I also added on a pile of dry, overcooked, frozen crinkle cut fries for $1, which I regretted.The potato skins, housemade quarter-potato chunks, get loaded with large pieces of bacon and cheese, with only the slightest bit of sour cream to lubricate your throat. The stromboli is huge, cheesy and possibly the saltiest thing I've ever eaten.As far as video poker taverns go, this one is kind of blah on the inside. One pool table, sort of barren beige decor. The staff always seems friendly enough but this just seems like a depressing place for a meal or a drink. Do yourself a favor and pay the 50 cents per item surcharge to get yours to go.
4	If you like stromboli's this plas is awesome. Huge portions. Good service and cheap drafts.  We order a large and take home enough to make 2 more meals. Great deal
4	Good and very reasonably priced food. Makes breakfast super easy on the weekends. Frequent customer. Very friendly and polite staff.
4	I've been here twice. Great bar food at an awesome price (especially the daily specials!!!). The first time the bartender was not so friendly and very sloooooow. The second time it was slightly the same especially since they had forgotten all about my food!!!! Yet again it was during a shift change and Brandy (the next bartender on duty) turned my experience around. She was very friendly and fun. My boyfriend and I tried the small supreme stromboli which can easily feed 4 people! and the fried mushrooms. If you're looking for good prices and trying to lay low then definitely check this place out.
4	Best pot roast I've tried!
5	The best strombolis in town.  Their small size is HUGE!  Reasonably priced and updated menu.  Helpful staff that might be caught off guard if busy.   Nice non-smoking section with TVs.
3	There is only 1 reason I come to T Birds and that's to eat there special Stromboli!  This is the only place that I go too when I'm feeling super hungry for Stromboli! I made the mistake the 1st time by ordering a large and boy was that the biggest Stromboli I seen.  There Small can feed 4 people easily and that's what I order ever since. The restaurant is nicely separated from the bar and completely smoke free.  There are TV's in the area so you can watch your sports game during your lunch or dinner.They have a large menu ranging from simple appetizers to full course Surf and Turf meals.  The Stromboli is obviously my favorite.The establishment is really clean and the staff is really friendly.  It doesn't get that busy so service is always there to fill your drinks.  They have a full bar so you can order any drink you want.  Gaming is also available here.
5	Holy crap! This place surprised the hell out of me! I drive by this place everyday on the way home. It's right off Blue Diamond and Lindell in the same shopping center as the Star Nursery. There is nothing in this shopping center other than these two things. I don't know why but from the outside and the name of the place, I was hardly expecting much. What I found inside was quite a surprise. This wasn't a crappy run down bar. This was a bar that rivals most neighborhood bars I've been to. They've got the entertainment (pool table and shuffleboard) in their own little sections with separate seating for good size parties. The place is spacious inside with plenty of seating. There's also a cool-lookin jukebox with a nice selection. For Christmas, they've decorated the place up quite nice. During my visit, the staff was really friendly and always had smiles on their faces. The service was prompt and I had no complaints whatsoever. They had hefeweizen on draft which made me super happy also.But THE most impressive part of the place even after everything I've mentioned thus far? The food. Holy s!$t... The lady told me before I ordered the wings that they beat out Buffalo Wild Wings and Hooters... I thought, "Yea right, but whatever. I'm hungry." Dude. They're not messin around. The wings were OUTSTANDING! And they indeed hit my top place to eat wings of all time, and I am a bar food veteran (I don't know if I'm proud of that, though). My wife ate a California chicken club that had fresh bacon and guac which was amazing too. I could totally see this being my new favorite spot for a drink and some dinner in a pinch. There's nothing better than my wife's Nepali dishes she cooks, but this place came pretty damn close. Even she loved the place, and she isn't impressed too easily.Needless to say, we'll be back. I had no complaints whatsoever. They had it all. I think more people should know about the magic that happens at this place. I'm surprised I was born and raised in Las Vegas, I've been to hundreds of bars, and I've never walked in to one of these bars. Man, they've really got it goin on at this place. I can't say enough great things about it. Just trust me, though. You won't be disappointed.
5	i think this is my new favorite bar. they have great food and super cool servers. the last couple times i've been i got the hot chicken fingers and fries. only thing i need more of is the ranch! the server we had last time was really cool. she back talked to my brother which i thought was hilarious and then came and check on us ever so often. we then decided to play shuffle board which was the awesomest idea ever! the place isn't usually packed when we go but i'm sure during the weekends it gets busier. darn, now i want chicken!!
5	Best Chicken Wings in Vegas !!! Medium are just right not to spicy and not to blend. And teriyaki wings are also really good, make sure when you order get them pizza oven, and teriyaki charred, trust me you will not be disappointed, A bucket of wings (around 35 wings) and two cokes for about 25.00 is not bad.
5	Not far from home and very excellent breakfast!  I was alone so decided on a Sunday morning to eat in the bar. Greeted immediately by the bar tender and ordered an omelet. Wow for $7.50 you get a huge omelet, big helping of homemade cottage potatoes and toast. $3 buck less than Ihop. Very clean inside and not smoky at all. 5 Stars and I will return to try the wings and stromboli everyone makes mention of on Yelp.
4	What can I say? We love our T-Birds! Friendly staff, cheap drinks, and awesome bar food! Never crowded and you can always count on catching pretty much any game you're looking for there. Try one of their daily specials, the fish and chips, or breakfast!
4	I live in Southern Highlands so we came here when they first opened. It was nothing special. Decided to try it again, I have to say I was impressed. I tried the  Supreme Stromboli. Wow! Not only was it huge but it was tasty and the dough was cooked through. I also like how the dough on top was thinner than the bottom. The service was also friendly and attentive.
5	Gotta say .. I love t birds laid back inviting atmosphere!! Every time I come here it's a nice experience.. Cheap good food all day and night .. Out waitress' name was Lana and our bartenders name was Tina .. Both were truly sweet and informative about inquiries I has made about the restaurant.. People please if you have not, give t birds a shot it's a fine place for cheap good food, a great beer and some slots!
1	I have never been so disappointed when dining out. The service was good, but the food was horrible! Everything was bland, bread was stale and tomatoes and lettuce were so old... yuck! I don't know if this place has just gone downhill or if it's always been this bad, but I have no desire to go back. There's so many great dining options in Vegas and T-Bird Lounge definitely needs to step up their game!
2	We have been here previously and had pleasant experiences, but that was not the case today. I ordered one of their T Bird Smash drinks. It was listed at $5 on the menu. When I ordered, the person serving us said they weren't sure how to make it... Because they were "just" the manager. The ingredients were simple- grape vodka, soda, sprite, and a splash of chambord- so I said I wouldn't be too picky. It came out really strong, but I could deal with it. I was surprised, however, that a manager would not know how to make a signature drink. My husband ordered a Blue Moon and we got some potato skins to share. He put $20 in the machine and we settled in. Service was a bit neglectful; we had to pile our dishes and flag the manager down to get our bill. It was not very busy, either. There was one other patron at the bar. Our bill was confusing to say the least. I was charged $5.75 for my $5 drink. There was a mysterious charge for 3x $0.25. And my husband was charged for his beer despite playing $20. We paid and left- no goodbye or thank you from anyone. It's a shame because I'd liked the T Bird prior to today, and we live nearby. We will be voting with our money, though. Bars like this are a dime a dozen in Las Vegas.
5	I love t birds and Araceli is an awesome server. It was busy today being that it's Sunday afternoon.. Service was a little slower but that's because our server had like 1,500 tables.. Still she handled us with care and attentiveness .. I had the eggs Benny and the eggs were poached very nicely!
5	if you want a pleasant bar lounge atmosphere. Friendly witty waitstaff who love the food and fresh fries chips. excellent service excellent high quality food for the price. then you have to eat here !!!!!!plenty of menu options including pizzas and Stromboli !  can't wait to come here again!
3	I know .. Your thinking...Who rates a bar???  This is a local hang out... The bartender DJ is so wonderful!  She calls you by name, remembers your beverage and service is excellent!  The menu is well thought out... The food is kinda bland... But the portions are huge!!This review was for the T-birds off Eastern..
3	The wings are actually quite delicious. The size of the wings are larger than the usual wings you find at other bars. An order comes with 12 wings with the sauce of your choosing. Apparently the hot is REALLY HOT! Hubby got bbq wings with the crinkle fries. We left with full bellies and a general satisfaction with the T-Birds chicken wing experience.It gets a 3 / 5 stars from me due to atmosphere and slow service. An overall clean bar that was not full of smoke or lingering smells.
3	came in for breakfast, did not like the biscuits and gravy. gravy too thin. flavor bland. toast was not well toasted and food was cold by the time I got my breakfast sandwich. usually the food is great here when we come for lunch or dinner. I was disappointed today.
