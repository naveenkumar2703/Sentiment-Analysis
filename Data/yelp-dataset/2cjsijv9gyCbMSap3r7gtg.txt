5	Brad is honest, reliable and incredibly kind and friendly.  In this type of business I think the relationship is equally, if not more, important than the actual work.  They do a beautiful job and will work with all budgets.  Very creative.  Wonderful and I highly recommend.
5	Brad has done 3 projects for me and we are starting on the 4th.  He has a great eye for design and we have been very happy with his work.
5	Wow!!  Brad and crew created a paradise out of yard of weeds.  I interviewed 15 landscapers, Native Bloom were the only ones who listened to me and did not offer a generic az design.  Always on time and great communication.  The Best!! PS My neighbors thank you too!
