4	Jack in the box is one of my favorites for fast food. The food here tastes good and is made fresh. For breakfast I like to get the Hearty Bowl it has all the breakfast foods mixed in including hash browns and it's pretty filling. You can't go wrong with the 2 tacos for 99 cents either, put some taco sauce on that and its good.
3	I have a weakness for Breakfast Jacks. I don't know why. This one is notorious for either giving you an incomplete order, or not being able to understand the workers, as I speak English. I mean that in the nicest way possible. (But check your order before you leave.)
2	Eh, I was hungry, nothing else was open at 3am.
