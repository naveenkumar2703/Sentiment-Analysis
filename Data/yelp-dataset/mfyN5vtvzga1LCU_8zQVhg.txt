4	I went here with a co-worker a few weeks back when they were just opening up.  The food and service were excellent.  The portion was just right.  Today we went back again and see they have a lunch buffet.  This was wonderful!!  $6.95 for all the great Caribbean Food you can eat.  Service makes you feel very welcome too.
5	Stopped in today for dinner.  Place was empty but the food was amazing and the service was great. Coming back for sure.  They will be chaning to an all you can eat buffett.
2	I ate here when they first opened and it was a great buffet for $6.95.  Went back last week and was very disappointed.  Arrived a little after noon and was told "they were running a little behind, so not everything was out".  There were 3-4 different chicken dishes and 2 fish (I think?) dishes, and a pasta.  All the fish and chicken dishes were tough and overcooked.  The pasta was good, but just basically spaghetti with a thin tomatoey sauce.  There was a shrimp dish that was so salty I could not eat it.  Two more dishes came out, an eggplant dish and pork chops.  The pork chops were like hockey pucks.  It is really too bad, as I like frequenting local places instead of chains, but probably won't return.  Also, the price has gone up to $7.95.  The only saving grace is the owner is very nice and personable.
4	i am a fan!  check out the weekday lunch buffet - it's a great opportunity to sample the variety of food they serve.  (and it's pretty cheap!)  i always take extra helpings of the plantains, as well as the yucca fries and sauce.  so delish.  on weeknights, there's also a decent special on the dish of the night.  always tasty, always a good value.  be sure to indulge in dessert too.  the flan is pretty amazing here.
