1	The worst place ever. Pathetic staff who are rude and cultureless. Stay away from this place if you can...
1	I had the WORST experiences renting from this apartment complex. I had laundry & laundry baskets stolen from the laundromat, my GAS SYPHONED from my gas tank and gas cap stolen. I understand that issues such as these may not be the fault of the complex, however issues that WERE in their authority address, they did not. I was sexually assaulted in the parking lot with my 2-yr-old in the car & with a police report filed and fear for my safety I was not granted the opportunity to break my lease- the office had no compassion and did not even offer to escalate the issue to accommodate me under such horrible circumstances. The list of issues drags on but I wouldn't recommend these apartments to anyone.
2	I've lived here for three months almost and have had an "alright" experience. I say only "alright" because in the time I've lived here, I've had a hit and run on my car that they basically said they'd "ask around" about and I wouldn't doubt never did. I've had maintenance enter my home WHILE I WAS SLEEPING when I said I didn't want anyone entering without my permission. The main manager woman in the front office is incredibly rude I.E. commenting about my personal life in a negative way. The maintenance do a half-*** job when they do fix something. The only person working in this complex I like is Nikki. If I didn't have a lease, I would've left this complex already. During move in, my apartment was still dirty, wood planks were left in my living room, and there was and is a nasty smell emitting from the water in the showers. Do yourself a favor and stay FAR away from this complex.
