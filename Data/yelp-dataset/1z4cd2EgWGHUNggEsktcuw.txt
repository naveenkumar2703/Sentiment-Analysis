5	I love the staff here and isnt that why we always go to certain businesses? because they know how to treat customers. the beds are amazing too!!
4	Girls are friendly.  But wish industry discount was a bit better.  I do like the fact that if you post a tweet once a week you get a free lotion and if you check-in on facebook you get one free upgrade a week!!!        so i was paying 38$ a month in a 6month plan and got 4 upgrades a month...   that makes this salon worth its money.
5	Never been to a more friendly tanning salon in Vegas! Manager is very helpful & knowledgeable of my questions about products & beds. :)
5	I love how friendly everyone is and they have the best beds that give the best color in town
3	Always very friendly staff...clean, just kinda pricey. Lotions are crazy expensive. But they ate everywhere!
5	Staff is extremely nice, signed up this week, 2nd time in, she knew who I was. Prices are nice, beds are clean and updated :)
