5	SALLY!!! I love her!  I came to her through a referral. I want a high maintenance orange copper color.  She worked with me to get the exact color I wanted.  I bought $200 extensions that I brought in and she colored them to match.  She colors my black roots without any bleach +++!  Sally also gave me really great suggestions for dry shampoo also shampoo and conditioner.  Allow yourself additional time.  Her prices are also reasonable.  Very happy and I refer all of my friends from Las Vegas and also visitors.
