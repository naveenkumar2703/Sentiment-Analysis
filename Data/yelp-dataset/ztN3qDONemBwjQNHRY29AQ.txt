1	Not pleased with service. Very poor customer service.
5	I work at a doctors office and Scott provides us with prescription pads, business cards, road signs, you name it! We have always been happy with the outcome of our products. They have managed to take a few words on paper and even whip up design ideas. I highly recommend these guys for any printed material. We recently had an error on a prescription pad order. Scott took back the order, repaired it, and delivered it free the same day. Awsome!
5	I have been getting my signs ans whatever Scott can do for years! Since 1995. I highly recommend these guys. In fact, ordering again from them today! Thanks Scott!
