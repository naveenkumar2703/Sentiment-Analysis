4	My husband needed some new work shoes, must be skid resistant and affordable.  He's hard on shoes, so we got the "bogo" last time we bought here, but today, they weren't offering that program.  The price for today's shoes, $45.  Not really a bargain, if they last at least six months, we're doing good.  I had someone tell me about Sketchers, so next time, we might try them!
3	Good location. Clean store. Manager is very pushy with deals and sales info when I first walk in store. Let me come in and browse a second before you pounce.
3	Rating a Payless is like rating any other type of chain place, if you somehow had a phenomenal customer experience, it would be a 4 or 5. It you had a miserable customer experience, you would give it a 1 or a 2. If you just went in, everything was as expected, nothing more or less, it's a 3. This place was a spot on 3. We came in, the sales person warned us she was closing in 15 minutes, we ran over to their selection for my girlfriend, picked out shoes quickly, and brought them to the register. She rang us up quickly, gave us the 20 percent coupon deal, and off we went only spending 17 bucks.Payless is pretty good, always has real cheap shoes (especially mens shoes, I have gotten some real cheap dress shoes for 20 bucks for work), but we also found great deals at Target for almost the exact same shoes my girlfriend wanted for a dollar or two less than Payless, but better looking.
