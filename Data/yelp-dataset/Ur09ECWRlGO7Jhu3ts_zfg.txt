5	Vinnie has been my regular barber now for 6 months. I have searched high and low for years for someone that can provide a good traditional shave and haircut. It's truly a high end experience that every man should partake.  If your a man and still going to unisex salon's to get your hair "styled"... well I am just saying!
5	OK.  Been to a few barber shops in my time for straight edge shaves, and Vinnie is right on up there with the best.  I decided to get a shave when I was staying at Vdara and my wife went to the spa (she's getting something for herself, I might as well get a little pampering as well).  I saw Vinnie at the Aria location.  Yes, it's in the spa/salon so it does seem a little weird that you're going to where all the ladies are getting whatever it is they do for their hair... but tucked away in the corner and a little out of sight is a room with 1 chair just for guys.  Awesome.  Tucked away where you don't have to hear girl talk and where a guy and his barber can just be guys with sports on the tube and talk about guy stuff!
5	Vinny where the hell are you? I walked around the aria for an hour looking for "Vinny the Barber" and failed!  Well, he actually works at he hotel salon. Hope this saves everyone an hour of walking and asking where the Vinny the Barber is. Smh
2	It's a beautiful salon, but a man's haircut is $65...
