5	My son and his cousin has been going here since the summer and they loves it! They're in the boys class with Coach Daniel.... he's awesome! The girls at the front desk is always so nice & courteous! Definitely burns some crazy energy, teaches discipline, and has tons of fun all in one!Thank you Brown's!!!
1	I rate this place as zero stars, I was invited to a free class for my child and then when I showed up with my family was told sorry you can't come in and asked to leave because they had a special training going on today. I was not offered a sincere apology for the mix up and not asked to reschedule her class. When I asked how I can get a hold of the owner to complain I was given a business card to call the main number. Being in customer service they should have gotten my information and given a call back to fix the error. But it seems they don't really care.
1	Both of my children loved this place.  My daughter has been going here for years.  She loved it so much she chose to have her 6th birthday party here.  The issue is not the teachers, but the finance department.  We unenrolled the children on dec. 30th and made payment for January.  We were moving feb 1st and were too busy to keep up.  It's now the end of June and we get a collection call that we did not pay feb payment.  Rather than call us, they choose to ruin someone's credit over $125!!  Called the office and no one was there who could make a decision, nor could confirm or deny that we did or did not withdraw in December.  How do you run a business and not have a decision maker within a phone call?  When you send a loyal customer to collections, and ruin thier credit, one would hope a phone call would be made to avoid such terrible consequences.
