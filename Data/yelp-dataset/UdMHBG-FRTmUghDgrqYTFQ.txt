5	I have been to this market on the move location twice already and always look forward to what they will have the next time. Im excited to the next one on Feb 4th 2012.
5	It moves every week, where there are a number of great places to pick up fresh fruits and veggies. Ten dollars will get you as much as you want! Also it is much fresher than grocery store produce - mine has kept fresh for more than 2 weeks!
5	Great traveling farmers market! For $10 you get a ton of fresh produce! Awesome deal, awesome environment, overall it's just AWESOME!
5	Awesome selection, even during summer hours.  I came home with my 60 pounds, sorted through and divided out what my boyfriend and I would be able to eat in 2 weeks, then went to work putting together an assortment of produce for neighbors and friends.  A great value and a great way to help your community.
