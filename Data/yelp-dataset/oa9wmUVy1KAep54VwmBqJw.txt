4	Love this store! I wish they had the raincoat i wanted in my size...it was on sale and Sooooo cute! alas, it was not to be. But definitely worth a visit to check out the cute clothes and accessories
3	I remember when this was only a teeny tiny little shop on the Royal Mile when I first discovered Ness (probably mid 1990ies), loved it! It felt welcoming, personal and much less commercialized than it is now. Still love the Ness style, colours and patterns of clothes and accessories, less pleased with quality plus the sizes tend to be smaller than expected (which of course isn't only an issue with Ness but with many brands these days).My best buys at Ness are still a) the wool gloves, which are surprisingly incredibly warm and b) the pretty fake leather/wool wallet. Plus their small tartan bags and purses. Adorable.
4	Tartan, tartan eveywhere! But pretty tartan. Tartan that's light pinks and purples and blues. Tartan on coats, on bags, on purses, on wellies, as flower brooches, as teddies, as hats and scarves. Tartan in the most pretty of ways.It is on the Royal Mile and might seem toursity; but it's not. I know many friends who own Ness handbags, wallets and wellies and they look incredibly lovely, fashionable and nice. It's also the place I take friends and visitors when they want to take home a nice, Scottish-themed present that isn't the usual tourist tat.Pricewise it's not too bad either. So all round it's a winner!
