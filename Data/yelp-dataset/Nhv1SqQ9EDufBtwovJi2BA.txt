5	I run a clothing store and consistently see clothing ruined by your average dry cleaner.  Do not send any delicate or woolen products to your chain cleaners, sooner or later they will be ruined because the staff has incorrect press settings or they don't read the care labels.Best Cleaners does an excellent job and I recommend them to all my customers.
5	I used this cleaner to press my wedding dress which was no simple task.  They did a nice job, largely because they do that work on-site rather than shipping it off to a large chain and re-wrinkling the stupid thing in the process.  Its a quality homegrown business and I love supporting it.
4	I brought a couple of shirts here recently and I must say they did an excellent job.  I talked to another customer in the store and she said she's been taking her clothes here for years and they always do a great job.  they were even very accommodating - they did a rush for me and had it ready a day earlier than they usually would.  The only problem is the location.  It's out in the middle of fitchburg.  So for me, that keeps it from getting 5 stars
5	We have had numerous items dry cleaned here over the years and they have always done an excellent job for really great prices.  We recently took in a winter coat that was cleaned perfectly and a sofa and l/s cover.  Both were done very well.
