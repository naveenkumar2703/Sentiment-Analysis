3	A convenient location not too far from SR 51 and PV Community College.
4	I usually fill up at Valero or the pumps at Fry's but I needed to fill up NOW & this Circle K was on the way to my destination. What I found cool about this particular location is that I was able to use my Fry's card & received 10 cents off per gallon. I will definitely keep that in mind for future reference!
4	This Circle K is right in my area and a great place to fill up.  Usually don't have to wait as they have plenty of pumps.  Circle K really has a good beer selection in their walk in cooler also which is also a plus.
