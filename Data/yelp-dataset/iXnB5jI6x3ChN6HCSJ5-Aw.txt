4	Dundas Street has a quite a few quirky and independent establishments to be found on its descent down the hill, and I think it's one of those streets that's well worth seeking out if you're a bit worn out by the bustle of the city centre, and you want to go somewhere slightly more tranquil. Glass & Thompson can be found here, for hiding away from the world purposes, and also for coffee, cake and other tasty food substances. The food here is a cut above your standard cafe fare, so expect an experience similar to eating in a really awesome deli or somewhere equally as selective with the prime food it offers. The menu is quite Mediterranean in nature, and everything on the menu seems to have a bit of a twist to it to make it slightly different, so you never feel like you're getting something very samey that another cafe could easily have replicated. The cakes are to be noted, for the only reason cakes should be noted, because they're awesome. It is slightly pricier than your average cafe here, but I think the food is of that quality that merits charging a few pounds more.
