5	Black Hair. African American Hair. Whatever you call it, lol Recently moved to Las Vegas from LA. Spent months looking for a stylist and finally found Ms Connie. She keeps my hair healthy and beautiful. I've tried others but always find my way back to Ms. Connie. Not only does she do a great job on my hair, she's professional and on time. She has flexible hours and rarely keeps her clients waiting. This shop is in the Ross and TJ Maxx shopping center.
1	I made an appointment for my husband (yes he is black and I'm not) to have his dreadlocks touched up. Not one person in the salon spoke to him other to ask who his appointment was with (I expected to be ignored). His stylist was Toya and she talked to another stylists for over an hour about how awful men are. Very Unprofessional, it's 2014 get over it.
5	I love Tisha (deva). I'm white, and this is NOT an "enthentic" salon. She does my extensions, and all my hair needs. As well as for my friends. This woman is amazing. Come here.
