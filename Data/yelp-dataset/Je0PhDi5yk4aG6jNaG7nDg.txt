3	Pretty good!  Of course you know what the product is like at a BR.  Everyone has been there once before.  But this one has the best service!  Drop in for a frozen goody!
1	For the past 5 years, we have been going there every single Friday, but NO MORE! We were mistreated and yelled at by THE OWNER!!! She was stressed and overwhelmed  with COSTUMERS instead of happy to have business. She couldn't keep track of the amount of ice cream cone she had served and decided it was better to scream at her clients for her mistakes and negligence. All this misbehaving on her part was done in front of children and new trainees!!! NICE!!! We will GLADLY take our business somewhere else where they do appreciate loyal customers and decent families.
1	If you like disgruntled -rude- teens touching money, the register, their face, everything else in the store and then bare handing your ice cream cones, then this is the place for you! Yummmm, bacteria! Oh and getting their knuckles in your ice cream while they scoop it out of the bucket is super tasty as well. Germaphobes beware.
1	Ive been to this Baskin Robbins many times with the same moderately acceptable service every time. The last few times the punks behind the counter were especially loud, obnoxious and went out of their way to make us feel uncomfortable. Truly unfortunate for the owner who should know how his/her business is being tended to. After last night's ludicrous display of teenage angst, i will never set foot in that place again..
