4	Responded promptly when emailed to set up appointment. Salesman was very helpful and installer professional. Got the screens up quickly and neatly. Pleased with their services.
5	Love these guys, fast, proficient, picky about fit. I love my AZ Sun Screens! I got the APS rebate and IRS tax credit too. They did such a good job on the screens I had them make me a screen door too, it is great. My sales rep even suggested the cheaper model as the look was better. The oldest ones are a year old and still fit tight and are not faded at all. The new screen door is looking good too.
5	Just had my sunscreens installed and they look great. Being a new home owner, I relied heavily on Mike's honesty and experienced on picking out the perfect screens. The screens were ready a week later and Tom did a great job on the instilation. They deffinatly darken the rooms, but I can see out better than expected. My house gets a lot of sun on the side with all the windows, so I'm expecting some nice savings. Wish I could post a photo to show off how good they look.
2	I had to call 3x  before I got a call back for an estimate.  Still went with the company. Paid 50% and waited 1.5 weeks before I HAD TO CALL to see what the status was...they were done but never called tell me..now let's see how long it takes before they finish the job. Frustrated customer.
5	Good company. I had them put sun screens on 2 houses. I immediately noticed a temperature difference. They provide good customer service. Del even fixed an internal screen that was damaged free of charge.
