4	Prompt, efficient and friendly service. Much better than average JIB. Keep up the good work!
3	Thanks Jack! The food was good, service was fast. It was Jack In The Box. We do not have this in Florida, so it was a nice treat on this trip. Jack In The Box tacos and curly fries are still my favorite.This place was particularly clean.
1	I'm so sick of this place screwing up orders! I stopped going there for over 6mo for just this reason...figured if I stopped by now, surely they have new staff, management, etc. and possibly the food and service quality has improved. I was WRONG. C'mon folks, it's fast food, for goodness sakes...   Jack has standard operating procedures; you make the burgers this way, you fry potatoes this way, (and you throw them out if they've been sitting in the warmer for over an hour, for goodness sakes) *face palm*The buns used in this JIB always seem "day old", the fries are NEVER fresh, the letuce sems consistently wilted, and to top it all off - the right food doesn't ever make it into the bag! I give up, no more for me, store is right around the corner from my home but I will drive 4extra miles to a different JIB.
1	I drove 30+ miles on my way home and could have stopped several times,  but I wanted Jack in the Box near home so it would be hot. I came through at 4am on 1/15/14 and there were bun crates sitting out blocking the drive through. The sign says open 24 hours. Period. Now I'm off work, going to be hungry because someone doesn't know what 'open 24 hours' means. This is poor POOR business practice.
