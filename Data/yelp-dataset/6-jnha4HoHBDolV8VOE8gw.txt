3	The store is actually 3053 W. Aqua Fria to be exact. Anyhow, I live in this neighborhood and decided to go here for breakfast. I usually come her about once a week if not more. It's my last result breakfast, lunch, dinner if I get in a pickle. I went today to see yet another new set of staff. This particular location goes through staff like nobody's business!The shift lead Angel, took my order, which was a ham,egg & cheese sandwich. The menu states it is $2.50 yet he charged me for a Western Egg sandwich making my total for just the sandwich $3.79. I don't mind paying for my food, but being overcharged for something that I didn't order is just downright stupid.
1	Make sure you ask about the coupons before you order. I ordered a footlong specality sandwich and the cashier told me that my coupon was not eligble.  The sandwich artist asked if I wanted some avacado on my sandwich without telling me this would be an extra charge.  Long story short, I ended up paying almost $10 for a footlong sandwich.  I will use the coupon next time but I will never visit this place again.
3	I eat here at least once a month. Typical Subway, no weaknesses- it is what it is- a Subway. Always clean and a nice welcome upon entering. Good ice tea selection
2	Pretty strange to be told by an employee making a sandwich that he would be fired if he added any more pickles!
