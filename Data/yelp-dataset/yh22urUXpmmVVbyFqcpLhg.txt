4	The Mound, at first does not appear to be one of Edinburgh's landmarks, but if you take a closer look it certainly is. This part of the city connects the Old Town with the New Town. And believe it or not, this hill is actually artificial and was created in the eighteenth century. Since, then the Mound has moved on with it being home to a number of landmark buildings. The Bank of Scotland has its headquarters here, the Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland is located here as well as the National Gallery of Scotland. The Mound is quite busy with traffic normally and is very popular with tourists making their way to the Royal Mile. The walk up the Mound is quite steep, but when you get near the top you get magnificent views of Edinburgh, including Princes Street and its gardens. Well worth the walk I think!
4	I had no idea the Mound was artificial. Matthew is a fountain of knowledge!I thought it had existed as one of Edinburgh's many hills for centuries, but obviously not. So we can thank the Victorians for the crazy ascent towards the Royal Mile, but at least it's good for the legs and I actually still love the Mound.With its road and many staircases that wind their way up towards the Royal Mile, the Mound also has the massive, gothic image of the Aseembly building on it. If you find yourself down a side street, there are also smaller museums such as the Writer's Museum situated on your way to the top.A steep walk but rewarding, as when you get to the top you find oodles of shops and a stunning view of the city. And if you can't bear the daunting steps or hike in front of you, it's a nice sight to see from the bottom.
3	It's steep so you get some good exercise going up the Playfair Steps. The Assembly towering up is very impressive and you can see down over the Scottish National Gallery and Princes Street. I really hate it in the winter when it's icey though.
