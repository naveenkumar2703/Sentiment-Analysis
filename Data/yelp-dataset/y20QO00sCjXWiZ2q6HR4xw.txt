4	I like this Barnes and Nobles because its located right in the Chandler Fashion Square. This place does get pretty busy over the weekends and it can be hard to find a place to sit. Since I can't keep up with my wifes shopping I often come here and chill with a book while she shops the mall....
5	Love coming here just to even look around !  Sometimes ends up being an expensive stop ! Theres a guy that works here, Jake, and he is so helpful and nice ! He picked out two books for me - which I loved both ! Will definitely have to look for him again when I go in for some more great recommendations ! :)
1	I go to this location ALOT and yesterday I did not have a good experience. Grabbed a couple books and tried to find a table to sit in the cafe, but no seating area open at the moment. So I sat on a book aisle. About 20 mins later, a staff came by and told me I couldn't sit on the aisle. I told her the reason I sat on the floor was because there was no seating. Would I really want to sit on the floor unless I had to???? I didn't catch the lady's name, but she was an older lady. Must be having a bad day or something. But I ALWAYS sit on the floor when there are no seating and no one has ever told me to move. She walked over to the cafe and try to direct me over and pointed to a couple open tables. It was sort of rude, so I dropped off the books that I planned to purchase and left the store. I saw a bunch of people in each aisle standing and reading and she didn't seem to have a problem with that. I rate this location with 1 star due to the staff being rude.
