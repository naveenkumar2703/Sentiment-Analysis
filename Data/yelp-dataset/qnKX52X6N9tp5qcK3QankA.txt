5	Convenience wins you a lot of favor in my book. If I can get to a business by walking, biking or stopping on my way home from work or school, it gets big points.On that note, Uno Stop is about as convenient as it gets for me. Trying to put that aside, I really like and appreciate this new business in the neighborhood. They took over a very large building and have a laundromat, convenience store and even serve some food.I have yet to do my laundry there, but I have stopped often for Redbulls, packs of gum and a box of cereal and have been greeted with friendly service and reasonable prices.What I like the most about this place is their teriyaki bowls. They serve a smattering of Japanese food, but their teriyaki bowls steal the show. I always get mine with tofu, but you can also opt for beef or chicken. I've heard good reviews on the meat versions from friends. You can also choose from sticky white rice and protein rice, both are extremely tasty. The best part (other than the delicious sauce) is that they are UNDER FOUR BUCKS. I mean, srsly? Where can you eat something relatively healthy for that much anymore?The guys that run it are always super friendly, so if you're in the area by all means- give them a try. Plus, if you need a good laundry mat the whole place is brand new, so I have to imagine the washing machines are all probably pretty sweet.
5	It's nice to have a beer while you wait for your laundry to wash. $2.00 for 16 oz draft or 12 oz domestic bottle and edamame for $1.59!
3	This place has a new name. The new owners don't sell alcohol. I'm not sure what food they serve. It's an Indian market now. The laundromat side doesn't appear to be manned and it doesn't look like they offer any services other than coin op. I think they still have wi-fi. It was clean and the washers worked. The Indian market also has a nice variety.
