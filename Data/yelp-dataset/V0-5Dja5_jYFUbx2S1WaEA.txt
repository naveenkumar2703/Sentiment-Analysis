4	This place's signage has been up for a while and I've been waiting for them to open. They finally opened up today (1/2/10). Like other frozen yogurt places, it's a self serve set-up where you get your yogurt and add on the toppings you want. The flavors are pretty standard, but everything I sampled was delicious, especially the cheesecake. All the toppings looked extremely fresh, as is to be expected since it was their first day open. But the owner said they plan to use only fresh fruit and not the frozen stuff. It's 34 cents an ounce, which is pretty much on par with other places around town. The interior is brightly colored -- pinks and blues. They use picnic tables for seating, which is a cool idea. They also have kid-sized furniture for the little ones. Free wifi is also available. The owners are super nice. It's great to see some locally-owned businesses popping up in Mountain's Edge. I'm sure I'll be stopping by regularly to support them.
5	The yogurt was awsome, the toppings were fresh, and the workers are very very friendly!!!!  The place was extremly clean and fun atmosphere!  I'll be back!!!!
5	This is incredibly the best yogurt I have tasted! The entire place is very family friendly and the employees are indeed accomodating. I have  yet to go to a place that has both NY Cheesecake and Cookies n Creme swirled together. Combined, it is considered the pinnacle of dessert endulging. The owners know how to put together something so big, so convenient. I cannot go a week without it! Incredible!
5	This place is a 2-minute walk from my house. That could get dangerous. Everything I've had so far has been excellent. Good frozen yogurt. Fresh and tasty toppings. It seems decently priced too (I have yet to pay).
5	I like this place the more & more each time I come.They dont have a lot of flavors, but I tend to like the "flavors of the day" (pistachio, york peppermint patty, and strawberry are good).. My family liked Taro and think its better than yogurtland..& their yogurt is super creamy.What I love about this place is the homey feel, friendly staff, and clean environment.  I called to see what time they closed one night & the gentleman said 10pm but he would keep it open a little later if needed.  THAT IS CUSTOMER SERVICE! Oh, and they have the best 5 stamps & you get a free yogurt card.. fresh fruit (not frozen).. a cool community board.. okay I guess I can go on and on..
5	taro, bombpistaccio, bombvery strawberry, bombowners are always friendly. i hope more people get the word out about this place
4	Frozen yogurt shops are popping up all over Las Vegas (I mean ALL over) and I have tried many of them. Poppy's is pretty delightful. It is one of those 'yogurt bars' where you get your own cup, fill it up with the flavor(s) of yogurt you desire, and pile on your own toppings. Then you put your creation on the scale at the register and pay based on weight. Poppy's charges 34 cents an ounce. A few cents less than U-Swirl and a few cents more than Yogurtland. The yogurt is very creamy and tasty (it tastes more like ice cream than frozen yogurt) and is perfectly tasty -- not the best frozen yogurt in town, but still very, very good. The yogurt can sometimes come out a bit 'melty,' so ask for a sample taste before you choose your flavor and pick one that's really frozen.The toppings bar has lots of choices - lots of fresh fruit (not the syrupy kind) including blueberries, peaches, strawberries and raspberries; all sorts of cookie and candy pieces (including large chunks of Butterfinger, much to my hubby's delight; he hates the pulverized candy, but loves the big chunks of candy here); a lovely selection of syrups (including SUGAR FREE caramel and fudge); cookie dough pieces and brownie pieces (not so great; U-Swirl has them beat with their tasty brownie chunks); a variety of nuts, and more. The interior is cute, bright and cheerful with pinks and blues and even picnic tables for seating. It always smells really yummy, especially when they are cooking up fresh waffle bowls. Be sure to ask for a punch card - buy 5 cups of yogurt and your 6th cup is free!Poppy's is off the beaten path, so it's sort of hard to find. But it's worth the trip and is a great place for a yummy and reasonably healthy snack.
5	My BF and I always come here. This place will make you happy from the moment you walk in with all the bright colors! The froyo is so yummy and cheap compared to a lot of other places. I love how they always change up the frozen yogurt flavors! They have a great variety of toppings too!We're pretty much obsessed with this place. The workers are always really friendly and nice.P.S. Cake batter & red velvet are my faves. YUM!!!! :D
5	I love that they have a non-dairy option. Toppings are fresh, employees are friendly and helpful. Close to the house and decently priced. Dangerous combo.
4	Poppy's Frozen Yogurt.."mmmm..."I love that there's a location here in the neighborhood of Mountain's Edge for frozen yogurt.We don't have to drive so far to get that "mmm..." feeling during this hot summer season.
5	My son loves the berry sorbet! I really enjoy taking my little one here because it's much more kid friendly frozen yogurt places in town. Not only that but it's close to our home!They have books, small tables and chairs for the little one and a water dispenser to help rinse down the sweets you just had!We love this place!
5	I always feel like a total creep when I go here because of the 14 year old chicks behind the counter. It feels even creepier to write it because it almost makes me seem like I'm thinking about these girls in an inappropriate manner. Goddammit, now that I'm writing this review, I'm thinking of terrible things. Yelp turns people into pedophiles. See how I got there? Chris Hansen better not come knocking on my door, I'll be super pissed. And also kind of starstruck, I guess. It's Chris fucking Hansen!All joking aside, I love high school girls. They're just a few years past their prime, but they're still edible.But this review isn't about the succulent pieces of jailbait behind the counter working their summer job. It's not about that at all. That's my LEAST favorite thing about this place. It's about the fact that you get to take a big old cup, fill it with as much frozen yogurt as humanly possible, put on every single topping you ever wanted, and then weigh the bastard. You pay by the weight. This is my favorite part. Yeah, this part. Not the jailbait. The frozen yogurt part.
5	I should give this place 1 star because the one time I went in there I did no see any 14 year olds working. I got stuck with a big burly man which definitely did not sit well with me. When I order Frozen Yogurt I want to be greeted by the innocent smiles of the pre-pubescent. Seth Y's review has completely tainted my idea of Poppy's and I feel like I need to go back now....for the Frozen Yogurt of course.All illegal comments aside, this place is really fucking good. I had a really strange flavor that of course escapes me now but I got to put fresh kiwi on it. Kiwi is the tits! Who doesn't like Kiwi? That's what I thought. Now go to Poppy's damnit, you won't be disappointed(unless you are patrolling for underage tail)
5	So I went back in to Poppy's tonight for the first time after writing my first review, and I made the mistake of pointing out my identity to the Yelp-savvy owners.This review will serve as my apology for writing about the jailbait-cashier-toys. That was not family friendly. Not at all. Let me start my letter.Dear Poppy's,Thank you guys for staying open a few minutes past 10PM so we can gorge ourselves with your delicious yogurt. Cake batter, Hershey Heath... CHEESECAKE YOGURT? Get out. Seriously! Get out. Like... totally.No, the yogurt is amazing. It's cheap, it's delicious, and it hits the spot. In all seriousness, if you find yourself in the area, try it. You'll never go back to Coldstone... or worse, Golden Spoon.Five stars easy. Poppy's, I love your shit. You stay classy.Hugs and Kisses,Seth Y.
4	For as much competition there is in this town for frozen yogurt places, I feel for newbies such as Poppy's. But their friendly staff and unique flavors just may influence the masses to put down their Golden Spoon and try out Poppy's. The berry sorbet is life changing, especially with some blueberries thrown in there. Support your local yogurt establishment and visit Poppy's!
5	My family absolutely loves this place! The owner's and the employees are super friendly.  They always have a great variety of fro-yo available and a nice mix of toppings.The frequent customer card is great! We are forever getting free yogurts because we go there so much.My favorite at Poppy's?  Cheesecake yogurt with granola and chocolate chips- absolutely delicious!
5	I love this little place. The yogurt is the kind that tastes like real ice cream. Not the tart stuff. They have a nice range of flavors. They also always have vanilla and chocolate as well as the ever-changing others. I hate all those bizarre flavors yogurt places always have. The topping bar is spotless and well stocked with everything imaginable. The owners are super friendly, and watch those toppings from grubby hands going in! I love going to a well run family business and feel appreciated. Make a point to go here if you love yogurt. Oh, and the prices are great too.
4	This place is awesome. It's located right in my backyard (literally) and full of delicious treats and friendly people.As far as frozen yogurt goes, it's definitely some of the better stuff I've had. Sometimes the consistency can be a lil soft (I like my yogurt firm), but never enough to make me sad. My only wish is that they switched up the flavors more. I like the mint (rare) and cheesecake (always available) most. They seem to have a non-dairy option each time I go, too.The toppings are top-notch. As other reviews have stated, the fruit is fresh and ripe. They have mochi and pretty much every candy one could ever desire. I love you, Poppy's. I would visit you more if you didn't make me so pudgy.
3	Great place! Love that it is so close to my house. Try the cake batter flavor.
3	Cute interior..makes me feel like I'm at an indoor picnic. Nice place for family but there weren't many choices of flavors and it seemed like the yogurt came out a bit runny..but I'd visit again.
5	Love this joint!
5	Tried this spot out last weekend with the bf when I was facing a major battle with my sweet tooth and it soothed the beast.I tried all the flavors because I couldn't resist but settled on a full sized taro & pomegranate-raspberry sorbet swirl.  The bf got cake batter & cheesecake swirl.  We both piled on fresh fruit toppings and were out the door for under $6.I really liked that you can decide how much you want - most of the time I get too large of portions no matter what I'm getting and I have a minor problem not finishing the food I have in front of me - especially when it's as scrumptious as this yogurt is.  Another plus is, even if you do decide to over-gorge on the goodies, at least it's fruit & yogurt instead of hard core ice cream.  And if you really must have chocolates and candies, they have the extra sugary sweets.I really loved being able to choose my spoon color: pink.  It's the little things, I suppose.
4	I came here with my family a couple weeks ago because I had a Groupon for $10 worth of froyo. Just like most other frozen yogurt shops, this one is small and pleasantly decorated. The walls are pink and blue, which is a nice contrast. There are also happy flowers (fabricated flowers with happy faces) and flowers in vases to give the place a joyful feel. There are 8 flavors of yogurt and, of course, I tried all of them!These are the flavors they had that day and what I thought about each:Reeses Peanut Butter (tasty, light, peanut buttery, just how it should be)Cake Batter (meh, I've never been much of a cake batter fan)Kiwi Strawberry Sorbet (pretty good, refreshing)Taro (My mom liked this one, she said it tasted like ube haha)Hershey Chocolate (mmm, creamy, chocolatey, and flavorful)Country Vanilla (I'm don't usually like vanilla, but I liked this one because it didn't have an overpowering vanilla taste)Pistachio (probably my favorite. It didn't taste like REAL pistachios of course, but I enjoyed the flavor)Raspberry (My dad liked this one and he doesn't usually like and berries other than strawberries. I think he liked that it was fruity, haha)ALL of the frozen yogurt flavors were very creamy, non watery, and not too overpowering. The only reason why I'm docking off one start is because they don't have any tart yogurts at all, not even an original flavor. Other than that, this place is awesome. The people are friendly, the yogurt is so creamy, the toppings are fresh, the ambiance is chill, and it's a definite plus that it's walking distance to my house!
3	Bare minimum is what you get with Poppy's Frozen Yogurt.  With considerably less flavors than their competitors, it is a good thing that they are the only place within a six mile radius of Mountains Edge. The two flavors that I tried were both delicious, but with six options, you are not given the largest selection. The taro was as good as Yogurtlands and the pomegranate raspberry sorbet was the perfect amount of tart and sweet. The toppings are plentiful. My favorite is the Mrs. Poppy's homemade granola. It was golden brown, crunchy and had nice bits of dried fruit. Although I did enjoy this place, the fact that no flavors immediately jumped out at me was a letdown.
4	**Summary**       - They give you the option of a regular frozen yogurt or a Flizzard (frozen yogurt that they turn into a blizzard with a blender).       - Less flavors than the larger chains, but equal toppings.       - They carry 8 flavors a day including a "no sugar added" option.**Price**       - 34 cents per oz. I paid $3.20 for half a cup flizzard.**Ordered**       - "No Sugar Added" Cheesecake Yogurt Flizzard with a ton of toppings.**Recommendations**       - I'd recommend this place. Its flizzard option is a refreshing escape from the ordinary froyo joints. However, since everything is blended together, be wary of mixing odd combinations. In a regular froyo, you can simply eat them in different bites, but that's not the case when they're all blended together.
3	Came here on a Saturday afternoon to a packed crowd. I was also deeply disappointed to see that there were only a few flavors but that doesn't really concern me as long as they have a good original tart... which they didn't! =O yes i was shocked!! but anywhos, I opted for the Vanilla which was very creamy just like ice cream. They also had sorbets which were decent. Overall, this place wasn't exactly what I expected. I typically like tart frozen yogurt and this place was more like TCBY-icecreamy texture which I know many people love. This place is also conveniently located near the Mountain's Edge Park and from the crowd on Saturday afternoon, Poppy's Frozen yogurt must be doing something right!
5	I am a sucker for frozen yogurt.  Even more so when it's a frozen yogurt place close to my home.  They do not have as many flavors as some of the other chains out there but the flavors that they do carry are all excellent.  The also have a great variety of toppings- which is fun.  They are known for the flizzard!  I love it- its basically a blizzard (think dairy queen) but with frozen yogurt and all the toppings of your choice!  No more eating all of your toppings first- you can mix them all throughout your froyo combo.  Just make sure you choose yogurt flavors that go well together!  Decently priced and they offer a stamp card too so all of your trips here will pay off!
1	Sanitation - While the sorbets and toppings were delicious, I can't with good conscience give this yogurt shop a good review.  As I can forgive the girl for her lack of enthusiasm, I can't forgive her for pouring fresh yogurt toppings on top of old. If they are taking blatantly lazy shortcuts such as this, what's going on in the back?Eat at you're own risk  You are warned!
4	Was in Las Vegas for the weekend and found this great place for frozen yogurt. The mango flavor was the best I had ever had in a very long time. it was fruity and it did not require any additional topping as it was perfect the way it was. Service here was friendly and fast. the price was alright too. I was very happy that I came across this place!
5	excellent place. always nice and clean. yogurt is great - toppings fantastic.owners are very nice and we love eating here.
5	I went here after they had a deal on groupon. I absolutely loved it! Very affordable and they had great flavors and toppings!! I will definitely be going again! I'm so happy they had a deal on groupon or I would have never known of this place. The inside is decorated nice and I love that they have chairs and tables suitable for little kids! You don't find many places that put much thought into things like that! Loved this place!
4	It is so nice to have a frozen yogurt place so close to the house.  I can get there and back in less than 5 minutes which makes the frozen yogurt craving at the last minute much easier to deal with. The best part of Poppy's is the friendly and professional service.  Everyone that I have ever interacted witth there understands what "hospitality" is.  That is something you do not see in teenagers and young adults these days.  The only reason that I did not give them a 5 star rating is that they do not have as many flavors as some of the other frozen yogurt places do.  HOWEVER, what they do have is fantastic.  The bigges plus to Poppy's outside of the staff is the heated hot fudge.  Wow it is to die for.  The shop is always clean and I always feel comfortable there.  I have been there on several occassions and will keep coming back, no doubt.
5	As always Poppys is the best. I love the different flavors. I always get cake batter, red velvet cake and chocolate. Yummy. The best part about this place is the toppings. They have every one imaginable and it is patrolled politely to keep hands out. I am a germophobe and don't want people touching the food. The other best thing is it is owned by a very nice family. They genuinely appreciate your business and let you know. I passed on the Groupon because I want them to make as much as possible. Please try it ASAP!!!
5	Came in on a groupon and keep going back. Always delicious flavors! Best frozen yogurt shop in town. Friendly owners. Its a must go to spot if you live in Mountain's Edge.
5	This place is great! Really cute and very convenient to those of us who live in Mountain's Edge :) Service was great and the girl at the front counter suggested I try a couple first... I work out a lot and can still feel good about eating the non-fat Vanilla yogurt with fruit as a tasty treat once a week!
5	This place is awesome and so friendly.  I love going there after work since its right next to my house.
4	Good clean and refreshing. They have healthy yogurt for your shakes. The fruit was fresh.
4	Great location for Mountains Edge and fantastic yogurt with constantly changing flavors.  If there is one thing I would change it would be the size of the cups.  The only containers available are either small buckets or huge cups.  Most people just go to get a bit of something...make smaller sizes available, and I'd be one happy camper.
5	Amazing place with lots of yogurt favors to choose from - more than the average places. Good, clean topping selection too.Place is very clean. The young staff are friendly. Prices are cheap.
4	Wife and I were happy. Great place!
5	Not sure why I've never written a review on Poppy's before, but I LOVE THEM!! I live right across the street, and I love everything about this little shop. Everyone who works here is SO friendly! They have fresh toppings, the yogurt is always is tasty. I wish they would post which flavors were non-fat? Or if they all are? Honestly, I don't really care, but it would make me feel less guilty :) They do post which ones have no sugar added, which is nice. Love them! Would recommend them to everyone!!
1	Went here for the first time and was very disappointed. Little to no selection of flavors (that didn't have much flavor to them at all). The price you pay for what you get is staggering. Will not be venturing back to this place.
4	Good place when you have a sweet tooth!!! And super close to my place!!!!
4	Every time I head home, I always pass this place and I will stare at it in curiosity. One of my major weakness is fro-yo and I have to get my fix every so often. Living not literally five minutes away, I decided to finally give this place a try. Usually i'd eat it at townsquare if i'm there. Honestly, the name Poppy's and the cute pink interior design just seems so fitting together. The first thing that catches my eye, besides the interior design, is the yogurt flavor options. It's a small little community fro-yo place so I didn't expect to see all these different kinds of flavors like they have at townsquare, but it was still good enough for me. The yogurt options were Taro, Cheesecake, Fudge Brownie, and Vanilla? There wasn't much.  The toppings they have is good in variety and for the cheesecake bites, they have it in little trays so you can't squish it by accident trying to get it with a spoon. They also have a good variety of syrups and all that whoever likes to smother their yogurt. The price i'd say is about the same as the one at townsquare. Probably a little different, maybe, I don't remember. The cashier was this buff dude who was really nice too. He likes to wink, lol.For a neighborhood fro-yo, it's a good place and I'm going to get fat.
5	Love the place. Love the Owners!! Love the have PTA nights for Reedom Elem & Wright Elem as well & the donate a % to the school every month!! My fan normally bikes to the shop... So we feel like we are getting a wee bit of workout after indulging in something so yummy. I normally get the raspberry sorbet & chocolate yogurt! Yum! Or Thin Mint. My kids adore the cake batter. Now I want to gofer some yogurt NOW!
5	I really enjoyed the atmosphere and fun environment. The toppings were fresh and numerous! Great place for a quick sweet tooth fix! One suggestion add waffle cones as an option!
5	I love going to Poppy's!!!  The employees/owners are always so personable!!!  They have a great yogurt and topping selection.  We are lucky enough to be able to walk and enjoy a quick treat.  My teenagers love having a place to go with friends.  (These are cute and kind teenagers!!!)
5	I LOVE frozen yogurt! I might even consider it close to an addiction....it's hard to find good frozen yogurt. Trust me.! I have had my fair share of trying multiple different places. .:cough addiction cough:. (Lol). Anyways the froyo gods blessed me with Poppys. It is close to my home, always has the best flavors, and the freshest ingredients.
5	Love it!! Not only am I so excited there is a yogurt place this close to my new house, but it is delicious! Every time I have gone in, Poppy is working and he is so nice! They have a great selection of toppings and yummy yogurt. I highly recommend!
5	SALTED CARAMEL! Please...never get rid of this flavor!This is my favorite frozen yogurt place in Las Vegas because they have salted caramel and all the right fixin's to go with it. My friends have tried other flavors and have been content as well.
5	Salted caramel & NY Cheesecake!  The best fusion of yogurts in the place!  Not that they've fused them together, but --- each yogurt in one huge cup is a prize man.  The salted caramel is soooo good!  I love this place.  It's cute and tucked away.  Not overrun.  They have chairs outside and cute benches inside.  Seems family owned so that's great!  Support small business!  The add ins are always fully stocked when I come in...  and I never have a problem with coming and not wanting anything.  [Yes, this has happened.... many times. Not at this location]  There are about 6-7 options, and the yogurt is very good quality yogurt.   It's a comfortable place to hang out and is nicely decorated inside.  Not to crazy.  VERY kid friendly...AND PET FRIENDLY!  Everyone wins!! Even the animals!
5	Great place with wonderful options, if you're by the neighborhood, give it a try, you will not be disappointed.
5	I love this place! Very clean, very friendly, everything is fresh. This is my favorite place to get frozen yogurt.
5	Small mom and pop place but great fro-yo. They have the cheesecake bites which are the best thing ever! Don't have the biggest selection of topping but I don't but much on mine. Sprinkles and cheesecake and I'm good!! I like that there is always someone at the counter when I go it and get something.. Not that they are watching me but that they are there to be friendly and say hello. Nice place to help a late night craving.
5	Poppy's is a treasure for Mountain's Edge residents.  The frozen yogurt is so good and the selections change all the time.  They always have a non-dairy flavor for variety too.  We come here at least once a week... got to have our Poppy's!
5	I was hoping this place would be good since it is so close to my house. The selection is pretty good, I am definitely going to come back again.
5	This is a wonderful Frozen Yogurt self serve place!!! The ingredients are fresh and the vanilla yogurt is the best vanilla I have ever had!! It was a nice surprise after googling for a place to go to that was open after 9pm since that's the time we were craving it. This will definitely be my new top place to go to!!
2	I really like this place when they have decent flavors... It's close to me but I always have to drive to golden spoon because they alway have strawberry. I don't think they should always have that flavor but something fruity would be nice to always have. I don't really like chocolate yogurt,Heath flavor, banana creame,or just plain tart. I just think blueberry, raspberry,strawberry or mango is a given?
5	Come here all the time with my little sister. We love the pretty environment and the yogurt choices. Also, the owner is very nice (:
5	I love Poppy's! They are so friendly and welcoming! I recommend that everyone goes there :)
5	The owner Nicole is a sweetheart! This is a very cozy, family-oriented space filled with healthful and all sorts of sweet selections. I would choose to come here over any other shop out there!
1	This place is really close too me but unfortunately not good at all. Wanted some frozen yogurt but didn't want to drive to yogurt land so I decided to try this place. Next time I'm in the mood for yogurt I'll drive a little further.Granola was so salty, cherries were so bitter!
5	This is such a great little shop! We come here all the time and have since they opened. The owners are so super sweet and do a lot for our local community. Their flavors are great and the variety changes up a lot which is great!
4	Great little gem hidden in the mountains edge area!! They always have different/New flavors. Their watermelon frozen yogurt and banana are to die for!! The customer service is always perfect. The toppings are diverse and fresh. Reasonably priced. Don't miss out!
4	I have been here Several times. It's a cool spot if your in the mtn edge area. I give it 4 stars because the location and the service is great. The only thing I wish they had a bigger selection of flavors. It's pretty limited flavors compared to U Swirl or Yogurtland Town Square but I realize those are franchises compared to this mom and pop shop so it's understandable. I will def be back looking foward to the pink lemonade sorbet!
5	Poppys is always a quick fix when I'm in the mood for frozen yogurt. They may not have the biggest selection, but they always have exactly what I'm looking for. Plenty of toppings to be found along the toppings bar. The smiling faces that work there are always kind and welcoming. Also, they do have a rewards card so make sure you pick one up!
4	Great Place
5	I come here often because it's in my hood and who doesn't like frozen yogurt? I always get the cake batter yogurt. It's a mom and pop joint so they don't have a large selection but enough choices to choose from.They have all my favorite toppings so I'm satisfied. The employees always greet me and service is never an issue. It's a cute place to take your kids and to satisfy your sweet tooth during the scorching Vegas summers.
5	I love this place. They have great fro yo and toppings. The staff is always friendly, the prices are good and the place is clean.
5	This is a great Yogurt shop and the owners do a lot of great fundraising for the local schools. If you haven't been it's time to go!
5	Their cake batter yogurt is the best. It's not too sweet like cake batter can sometimes be at the chain yogurt places. I also love their topping bar. Lots of good selections and it's always very clean. Love supporting local and am happy to say that I don't only go to this place because it's the closest to my house. It's just so tasty.
5	I love all the flavors and the customer service is outstanding. Great team that works there. Dole pineapple is to die for. Place is clean. Glad to have it in the neighborhood.
5	A great little find in Mountain's Edge! We love the service here and the loyalty card program they have. Always disappointed that my favorite Dole pineapple yogurt isn't flowing constantly, hahaha....but a lot of other great flavors to try. Also like the plain/tart yogurt, it's refreshing. The pumpkin spice yogurt is delicious. Everything is self serve, and the staff is very generous with their sample cups. Clean & fresh, perfect for an afternoon treat.
4	Nice neighborhood place.  The only drawback is number of flavors.  I feel the yogurt texture is much creamier than other stores.  Easy to get to if you live in Mountains Edge.Cute benches for chairs and great music.
5	I love this local family owned yogurt shop year round! It's a quick walk from where I live so I take my dog for a walk and treat myself to the deliciousness of all the flavors and toppings Poppys has to offer. Their fruit is always fresh and ripe. My favorite flavors are regular Tart, Red Velvet and Cheesecake. The staff is always friendly and remember my name. They have a few tables to sit outside with my dog and a courteous water bowl for them. This is pretty much the ONLY yogurt shop I go to. They offer a loyalty punch card and you get one free.
5	Love this place!! Super yummy and fresh! The owners are nice and there's always lots of good gossip mags!
