1	not the best Korean food on the planet. however, in the paper- they gave this place a 4 star rating. eeeks. c'mon, if you're going to review a Korean restaurant... send a Korean over there to see if it's authentic and tasty enough. i was pretty disappointed- and the service was horrible. baaaa
3	As I write this, I've only been here once which was a couple days ago.  It's a 24 hour BBQ place with decent meat.  (I Hear at night it's better).  If you're going to compare it to Korean BBQ buffets in California or NY then you're going to be surely disappointed because the meat is, of course, a lot better in terms of quality and price than here.  However, if you're looking for a good late night eat that'll fill you up, this isn't too bad of a choice.  The grills are a bit small for a big party, but the people who served us here were really nice and always waited on us.  The decor could use a little more work.  The place isn't anywhere to brag about, but it's also a place I wouldn't mind eating if someone suggested it.
1	Won't see me there ever again. I am not Korean, but somehow I knew this was not right. I wanted my mom to taste something else besides to Chinese food. I walked in, it was an average size, nice colors. I got the menu and there was only 4 items available! I was like wtf... Then when the lady came and we asked her if we could have this one item and no we do not have the itrm. So I ennd up getting whatever was there. The only good thing was the rice... white rice that anyone can do... I don't know why this place has 4 stars iin other web sites.
