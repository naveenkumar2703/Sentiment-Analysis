5	When I'm craving Chinese food in Las Vegas, I always stroll down to the Buffet Orient. Although their selection isn't comparable to the massive 4 Star Hotel neighbors down the block, their Chinese food is one of the best I have tasted so far in the city. If you're thinking about going to grab fast food, think again... For under $6 per person, it'll get you salads, entrees and desserts. Or, you can also just load your plate with french fries.
