5	I've been taking kenpo from Z Ultimate for about a month, and am almost ready to progress to yellow belt, thanks to the great instruction from all the guys here.  They offer beginner, advanced, and mixed group classes for adults, and your monthly fee includes a private lesson each week (30 minutes).  I had taken kenpo before more than a decade ago, and was excited to start up again.  In one group lesson I had learned more than I had done at my previous studio in a whole month.  The group classes will definitely give you a good work out!  I've had my private lessons with Jacob, who is a great teacher.
5	Passed my yellow belt test in a little over a month thanks to the instruction of Casey and Jacob at the Gilbert studio!
5	This place has super caring people. You will always feel welcome. It's a great workout and whether you are a beginner or advanced it will challenge you.
5	These guys are great.  Started a few years ago doing Thai chi and now doing weapons and martial arts.  Casey is mellow, fun and really knows his stuff.  Hate doing reviews, love Casey.  Go Z Ultimate.
5	Started my daughter here just recently and we are super happy with this dojo! They have group and pivate lessons and take the time to help you learn. Can't wait to see how she progresses.
