3	For having the word "coat" in the store name, there was a surprisingly small amount of actual coats here.  Despite that fact, I did manage to find a decent winter coat that didn't cost me an arm and a leg.
2	This place feels like a Goodwill.   Areas are picked over, the men's clothing section is dusty, empty in places and just plain sad.   They have some nice things in their home accessories section where we have found some very nice items for good prices.  We don't go here much anymore.
4	I actually really like this store. They have a great selection of cheap, fun jewelry(if you're willing to dig through the jam packed displays--which I am, when I'm looking for a deal). Most of the time I can find cute earrings and necklaces for $4-8. Everything else can be hit and miss, though. I've gone in and found cute purses, clothes and shoes...and other times it seems like everything is either outdated, or WAY too wannabee trendy. I find this to be the case at similar stores like Marshall's and TJ Maxx, too. Bottom line: stop in if you're in the area and have some time to dig through the racks...but don't expect to always find a diamond in the rough.
3	This place is a hot mess but I love a good deal so I will be back! It's in a shopping center with a HUGE parking lot and it's right outside of the westtown mall.....I love when all my favorite stores are close to each other!!!As long as you come armed with a shield of patience you will find some cheap, unique items here. They are very similar in their offerings as TJ Maxx (i've been to both in one day and seen many of the same items) BUT Burlington doesn't only carry name brands...they also carry some VERY cheap quality items, especially in the shoes department. I would def. hit up BCF and score some of your basics and (maybe) jewlery before heading to west town mall and investing in some quality pieces.
