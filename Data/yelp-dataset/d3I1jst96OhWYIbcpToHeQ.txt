4	If I am looking for a dress for a wedding/dance/formal occasion then Coast is usually my first port of call. They are always hot on the latest trends and have a better selection than dress shops such as Monsoon which I find can be a bit samey. Although Coast is not cheap the prices are reasonable for the quality and they often have good sales on too so you might get lucky and bag yourself a bargain.I remember a few years ago I needed a new dress for a formal event and after trawling around various different shops I was left uninspired and deflated by the ridiculously expensive price tags on some of the dresses I liked. I found a gorgeous red silk strapless dress in Coast and it was significantly less expensive than other stores I'd checked out and I fell in love with the dress as soon as I saw it.Most of the dresses in Coast are timeless and the quality is fantastic so the outfits here are something you'll be able to wear for years to come and not need to worry about it going out of fashion.
