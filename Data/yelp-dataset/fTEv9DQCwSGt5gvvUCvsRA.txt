5	QT is my favorite gas station/convenient store in AZ. They are always well lit and super clean. As soon as you walk in you're greeted by the clerk. Service is super fast. They seem to hire smart and educated people who know how to multitask. They have so many choices on drinks, snacks and candy. You truly cannot go wrong with this place!I go out of way to go to QT
5	Best gas station ever!!!
5	Love QT. especially their fresh brewed iced teas. Sometimes I'll get their sandwich deals for lunch - a sandwich (not bad for convenient store standards), chips & fountain drink for $5. Not too shabby.
5	Instead of long lines, sticky floors and disgusting fountain drink areas, these guys are the exact opposite.  Every time I walk in there someone is always cleaning the floors or wiping down the fountain drink area.  I'm always greeted with a "hello" when I walk in the door.  My favorite part is there are no long lines and if there are they are very fast at checking people out so you are out the door in no time. I definitely recommend this place for your everyday snack needs.
1	Love you guys.... But the diet Mtn dew fountain is not as good as store 476. Correct that ands it's a 5 star review.
