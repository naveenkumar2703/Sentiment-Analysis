5	My doctor's office used to be in the same complex as Genrich, which is how I found them, even though my doctor's office has moved, I continue to go here instead of Walgreens, Target, etc. I like it that it's a small pharmacy, there's rarely a wait longer than 5 minutes, the pharmacist and the techs are always friendly, always helpful, and too, I prefer to support an independent business.
5	I really, really like this little pharmacy!!! Why go to Walgreens when you can go to a local business, get better service and most likely even pay less than the chains?? [I normally pay way less for my regular generic prescription here than at Walgreens, where I used to get it filled---]I got turned on to Genrich's through a specialist whose satellite office is in the same complex--which is about the only way you'll know about this little gem of a drug store, because dig this, fellow Yelpers: the city of Phoenix WON'T LET THEM PUT A SIGN UP ON THE STREET!!! Like, what's up with that? Especially since there's already a sign up for the Virginia Court Medical Building that has room for Steve to put up a modest little sign??? I declare, sometimes I believe that the city really needs to revisit its small biz policies!!That said--if you need prescriptions filled fast, with no hassle, and want to support an actual small business in the city of Phoenix, go to 333 E. Virginia, park your vehicle, and walk inside the gate. You won't be sorry!ADDED TODAY: Don't forget to tell Steve Genrich that you heard about his great little pharmacy on Yelp!!!
5	oh no!!! closed! Was the best pharmacy ever...including Steve. He will be missed. :)
