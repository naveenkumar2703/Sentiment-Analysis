3	What attracted me to this shop was the rather fetching tweed suit displayed in the window, very dashing indeed. As well as tweed James Pringle Weavers also stock a whole range of cashmere products; scarves, jumpers, trousers and in additions to all of this they still find a place on their shelves for shortcake. It isn't the cheapest Scottish souvenir store on the Royal Mile but if you're look for good quality cashmere clothing then look no further and they seem to have sales on more often than not so you could bag yourself a bargain. I bought myself a super soft cashmere tartan scarf in Oban last year and it kept me roasty toasty throughout the winter and I can't recommend it high enough so if you're looking for something tartan than cosy you will definitely find something that fits the bill here.
4	As Eleanor has rightly noticed, there's few things in life more fetching than a crisp tweed suit, especially with some elbow patches thrown in for good measure.Jamesey gets my vote purely for having such a cracker on display, that just edge this store aboce all the other tourist dives that litter the mile.
4	You know you love it really...Picture the scene - navy jumper, purple triangles....yeah,you're in Pringle.It's got a bit of a cult following, does our Pringle. A lot of my friends when I was in 1st year came here for their pub-golf crawls...they come once and realise that they can't afford to come again, thus use the same outfits over and over. Nothing wrong with that!The price is hefty, not extreme, but hefty. Good quality though!!
