1	(This is the McD's inside the Monte Carlo food court)This place gave me and 3 of my friends food poisoning!  After losing alot of money at roulette, I wanted to comfort myself with some good ol' fashioned greasy food from my childhood. BAD IDEA.  7 people sharing one bathroom, 4 of them sick.  DO NOT EAT HERE!!
5	Las Vegas,. the only place with Spicy McChicken,.. my friends kept raving about how good the Spicy McChicken was; after a night of drinking throughout our whole trip,.... I just had to run to MCD before we caught the shuttle to the airport and ordered one before we caught our flight home,.. They were right,..Spiceyyy ahhhhh
3	This is a very busy Strip McDonald's in a food court. The prices are inflated. As far as service, it is okay. To be fair, if I were to rate the physical place I'd have to rate the Monte Carlo Food Court.
5	Open after midnight on New Years, how awesome. All I really remember is the guy with the electronic pad to place orders, kind of like the in n out ones and picking up our fries and cheeseburgers and eating them upstairs in bed a few minutes later. YAY!
5	This location is open 24 hours a day in the food court of the Monte Carlo.Lines do not get too long and service is great.It's the best feeling to walk back into the casino, partially inebriated, and just grab a burger and go up to my room.
5	drunk food. yum. :)
4	Staff is very friendly, the place is clean, and the food is warm. What more can you ask for from a fast food restaurant?
