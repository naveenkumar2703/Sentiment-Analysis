4	This place has more candles than John McCain's last birthday cake. Seriously. More candles than the candelabras on Liberace's grand piano. No kidding. It's like Cartridge World. Only with candles. I love walking around this place. As the name says, it is a great place to find a gift. The candles are of high quality and the scents will fill my entire apartment. They have candles of Shrekian proportions to small votives. And on Saturdays, in the parking lot, they give a away FREE stuff. I've yet to search the freebies but have passed by on Saturdays and seen the masses pillaging the waxy goods.
1	Blow it out. The party's over. This candle has flickered and the flame has gone out. Wax on. Wax off. Closed. And for anyone who caught my stand up, yes indeed, I have purchased tapered candles here.
5	GOOD NEWS!!!  The candle outlet is now "Global Home" and they are alive and well.  Same amazing candles and wonderful staff.  I am so very excited that they are back....Go see them...and tell them Lori sent you.
5	They are open once again!!!  The sign says Global Homes and still in the same location with the same wonderful candles and much more!
