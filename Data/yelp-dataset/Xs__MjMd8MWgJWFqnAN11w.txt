1	---This is for all Subway locations.---    You bastards!!!  Why must you make it so difficult to make a simple, crappy sandwich?   This is how it goes, "I'd like a turkey on wheat." then they put on gloves and ask "that was a what again?"    Do they only hire "short bus" people?  Ingredients, yup they regularly screw that up too. Either a huge handful of onions, or peppers, enough to make you gag, or they may give you only a single piece of onion/peppers. As if to say "I don't like my job, so now I'm going to ruin your sandwich so you can have a bad day too."    Why Subway why must you hassle me every time I get a sandwich?
4	The 4 stars is for this particular Subway.  Most have subpar service and questionable hygeine, but I was famished on the drive home last night, debated on a flatbread at dunkin donuts but i have those too often....and saw this Subway so I pulled in for a grilled chicken sandwich.  I walked in to a full house, but both employees behind the counter gave big smiles and eye contact and acted like they not only cared about their jobs, but about making good sandwiches and being nice to their customers.  Big thumbs up for service!  These two won my heart over....I hope they stick around.
2	It seems that everytime i go there tables are not wiped down. There always leftovers from previews custumers.  The one in 36st and mcdwell much better one. They even have free wifi!
4	Love to eat here. Something about sandwiches that always fill you up. They are simple and easy to make yet often you prefer somebody else to make me for you. I found that they do a great job here. The food tast great,  lots of selections and topping.  The food servers are happy and helpful. And if you want lots of something.  They are more then happy to add more, free of charge. Well with the exceptions of meat and guacamole.I be returning to this place as long as they continue the good work.
