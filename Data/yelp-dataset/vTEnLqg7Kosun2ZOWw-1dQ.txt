2	Call me before I got here to make sure they had an LED bulb for my pool I came over but they did not match the price they did on the phone. I live in North Las Vegas and I found this a difficult place to find. Don't trust Google Maps.
5	Very helpful and attentive even for being so busy; the two working on Memorial Day were very nice to deal with.
