4	It's been years since I've had Blimpie's Subs.  I was very happy to hear they opened a new joint in Scottsdale a few months ago.  Since they opened, I've dropped in here for lunch a few times.  My favorite Sandwich is the 12" Blimpie's Best, $7.49.  I also get some Jalapeno Chips to go with it.  I get it "Blimpie's Way", with all of the fixings...yum!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blimpies-subs-scottsdale?select=9oK4uPQAA1ofm3Urr282XA#9oK4uPQAA1ofm3Urr282XAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blimpies-subs-scottsdale?select=OE-d2e9jEzu1Ftb5wU0UJw#OE-d2e9jEzu1Ftb5wU0UJwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blimpies-subs-scottsdale?select=HAhmnUbnz1-N1LREIomd3Q#HAhmnUbnz1-N1LREIomd3Qhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blimpies-subs-scottsdale?select=UhjMsv5ipjmiekxuHPk8MA#UhjMsv5ipjmiekxuHPk8MAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blimpies-subs-scottsdale?select=QW-F1GdDmHROOqla0IK8Sg#QW-F1GdDmHROOqla0IK8SgThe restaurant is very clean and the employees here are friendly.

5	This place is a PHENOMENAL go to for a sub!!!This location has been selling many of their subs at a discounted price of $5 for a 12 inch. THe bread is ALWAYS fresh, and so are the ingredients....I always get the veggie and cheese and get ALL the fixings pretty much as far as veg, with oil and vinegar an' a touch of mayo. It's great with the parmesan bread.Staff is always friendly and so is the owner I've talked with him several times.Enjoyable!!
5	They carry Eegee's!!!!!!!I love Eegee's but am rarely in Tuscon. Finally I have a place to go satisfy my cravings without having to drive 90 min. Their subs are pretty good too :)
5	Always fresh ingredients, clean store, friendly staff, excellent 5 dollar lunch choices.  Doesn't get much better than that!
5	I work in the Pavillion Talking Stick Shopping center and find my self eating at Blimpies quite often. Their price is very affordable and their food is always fresh and delicious. I think it is the manager that has helped me out but he is very nice! He knows I work in the shopping center so automatically gives me a 10% discount. He also engages in conversations and tells me suggestions to get on my sub since I usually get the same thing every time. The manager of this place is what keeps me coming back and they will have my business!
5	I LOVE Blimpie - a toasted blimpie best is amazing! Bright clean store, super friendly staff. This is my quick go-to lunch spot.
5	Clean. Prompt and courteous staff. Great subs toasted or regular. I love the toasted ultimate club on ciabatta bread. Definitely try the Eegee's slushee/ icee stuff. I usually don't get that kind of thing but they gave me a sample and now I'm hooked. Tucked between YC's and the theatre it's a little hard to see from the entrance to this strip mall area.
4	very nice people, quick service to get me by comfortably on my 30 min lunch break from work. i love that they can press your sandwiches panini style, idk anywhere else that does that! since i go there 3 days a week, i signed up for the spendgo thing where i get $5 off for every 50 i spend.i wish they had avocado, and i wish they made their sandwiches on a deli paper so that when they're throwing the ingredients on the bread, they dont fall out and eventually get thrown away. i hate seeing my lettuce, spinach, and olive get swept into the trash because its so hard to keep everything between two pieces of bread. plus, it should just be on paper for sanitary reasons, am i right?
