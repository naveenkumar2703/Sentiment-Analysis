5	I've been to EDC.  I've done Mud Run.  I just did Glow Run and it was lots of fun. OMG, that rhymes!  Good music, positive vibe, lots of lights/ neon, happy people, rainbows, tutus, fairy wings, balloons, wigs,I got a bunch of freebies: glow-in-the-dark bands, Glow Run t-shirt, snacks, etc.  I think I paid $35 or $45 for early registration with a student discount.  I got to burn calories, have a good time and support AFAN.  There were runners of different ages.  Some ran with their costumed babies on a stroller.  Little girls passing me. LOL. All had fun.The weather tonight was just right.  It wasn't hot out.  They had water stations, I'd like to say, at every mile.  Before I knew it, I've already completed the 7k.  I'd do this again!
5	What a blast! Can't wait to do it next year and be the brightest person out there!
