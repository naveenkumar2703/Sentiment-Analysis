5	Great staff !!
5	Yes, I will be taking my kids here if I ever need to again. In and out. Not crazy busy. Went @4am. Caring, gentle, catering to my baby girl! Also didn't have a clue who to take my kids to as far as a pediatrician and I appreciate your input and referrals. Awesome team! Thanks Bri and Dr Bartha :] you two are blessings in disguise!
5	Came in late at night because my 2.5 year old son was vomiting every 20-25 minutes.The check in process is slow.However, everything besides that was AWESOME!Great nurse and amazing peditrician!!!  (I'd mention them by name, but I was a little pre-occupied cleaning up vomit)They took excellent care of us, very personable bedside manner and my toddler really liked them.  :)
