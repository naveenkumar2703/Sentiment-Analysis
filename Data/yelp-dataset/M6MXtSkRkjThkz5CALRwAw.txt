4	I usually come here when I want to ship something quickly instead of running all the way to the post office, it's usually not too busy and staff are friendly.
2	I've only had copies made here, so idk about the rest of their services, however I can tell you the copy machine is the worst. It leaves a black line down the left side of the page on every copy. I use these copies for work and need them to look semi professional. I always try to support locally owned small businesses like thisone it's a shame I can't!
