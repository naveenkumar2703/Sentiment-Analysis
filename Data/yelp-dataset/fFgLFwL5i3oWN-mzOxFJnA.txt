5	I have just recently started going to Desert Dove for hip pain from a strain, I was very impressed with the friendly staff, and what a knowledgeable gifted healer Dr Phillips is. This is not one of those in and out the door quick fix places, I can already feel the difference in one session but Love the way they help get to the root of the problem. I will definitely recommend to friends!
5	Great passion and insights from this entire team. They help you learn to be the best version of yourself.
5	Dr. Phillips is training me to recognize the thought processes that cause/exacerbate my symptoms and neutralize them so that my physical symptoms improve or disappear. And it is working! Concrete physical symptoms are subsiding that have been present and getting worse for years. I no longer take regular medication. Yay!He does this using the B.E.S.T. technique, which is non-invasive and painless. All I have to do is be willing to be honest with myself and do my homework. It works when I work it. Thank you Dr. Phillips.
