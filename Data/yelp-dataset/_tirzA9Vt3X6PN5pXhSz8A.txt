5	I purchased some pumice stone from Sea Turtle when I was in Phoenix for a quick cleaning job. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, and offered reasonable prices and a smile. Seems to offer a variety of other services as well to suit local needs.
5	Well I have been going to Leslies for 7 years, and I am done with them!  I needed to get my pool filters cleaned and last time I was at Leslies I was SCOLDED, because I hadn't had them done with in 6 months.  So I went to Sea Turtle.  Booked my appointment, told them what I needed.  Firstly Sea Turtle is CHEAPER for getting your filters cleaned, buy $30, bye bye Leslies.  They offer you cheaper alternatives to doing things.  And when the young man came to do my filters, he had the wrong ones with him, Don't worry Maam I will be back with the right ones.  Yes he was and he also brought some treats for my dogs.  They all knew what they were talking about and didn't treat me like an Idiot, like Leslies has done on many occasion.  Every one do yourselves a favor, and go see Kathy and her staff, they treat you like a real person.
5	The best in prices and service. Had my pool acid washed and then refilled  they  came by and ck my pool until everything was right.did not try to get me to buy the whole store....great job.
