4	This new, modern building, located at the corner of George Square is the new home for the school of social and political science! As a student within this school, this building has been a much welcomed addition to the school. The building has a modern, airy, open feel about it, with lots of windows letting in lots of much needed light (Never have liked buildings with hardly any light inside!). The lecture theatres on the first floor have lots of comfy chairs (a nice change considered the dreadful wooden seats you sometimes get in the old lecture halls.) and have all the modern appliances installed. The building is large and has many floors, all similar in design. On the basement floor there is a computer lab for the students of the school, it is nowhere near as large as the computer lab next door in the Hugh Robson, and that it is good as it doesn't feel as crowded! Also, across all floors there are places to relax and read - really a brilliant place for mature students who hate the noise of the main library!
3	This building is, in very ignorant architectural terms, modernism's response to George Square. I mean, there's nothing particularly invasive about it. It doesn't bother me in any way, but it's kind of strange looking to me. I think as far as architecture's concerned, though, I'm kinda orthodox. Or, more accurately, old school. I think McEwan Hall is gorgeous. David Hume not so much. I guess the Chrystal Macmillan Building falls halfway between these two for me.One thing that makes my heart flutter about the building, though, is that its Anthropology students, with their rebellious sense of humour, have nicknamed it the Crystal Meths building. As far as I'm concerned, every university needs a Crystal Meths building, which makes it sound more like a laboratory where students go to get high and tested.
