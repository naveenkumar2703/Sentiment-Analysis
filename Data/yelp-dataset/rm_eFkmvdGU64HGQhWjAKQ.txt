5	LOVE! I have been going to Flesh Creations for 3 years now and never will I go to another shop again. Probably one of the cleanest, organized, reasonably priced, and friendliest shop I have been too. They are always running great specials on tattoos and piercings and have regular tattoo parties ($40 tattoos). Duane has done 5 of my tattoos, a cover up and a handful of piercings for me & Taija has done a cover up for me as well. They are the best and Flesh Creations has definitely become my home away from home!
5	Best tattoo & piercing shop I've been too! Duane has done 2 of my tattoos and several piercings and is super nice. Taija has done 3 of my tattoos and they're all beautiful. The staff is super friendly and accommodating and the shop itself is clean and everything's sterile. I've been going here for 4 years and don't plan on going anywhere else. If you're looking to get a tattoo or piercing this is definitely the place!
1	Went there on sunday at 2pm, they were closed. Hours are 12pm-9pm on sundays. Waste of time
5	This place is the best! I have 2 beautiful tattoos done by Taija. She is a true artist who is detail oriented and can design and implement your one of a kind tattoo. The shop is bright and clean. My daughter has 3 beautiful tattoos by Taija, and 2 beautiful ones by Duane. The artists and this shop ROCK.
5	Great place! Got my first tattoo and the artist was great. I brought in a crappy drawing and Shane turned it into something amazing. He had no problem working with me when I wanted to make corrections to the drawing and told me everything I needed to know about aftercare. Can't wait to get another one!
