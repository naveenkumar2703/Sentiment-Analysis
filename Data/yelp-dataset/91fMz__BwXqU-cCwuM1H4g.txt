5	In all honesty I don't have kids that go here but I have relatives that do and they love it. I know they researched every option in town and decided on this school. The standards are high and they don't let kids get away with slacking. Seem to really work to bring out each child's potential.
1	I went here for 9 years before switching to public school. It's not great like everyone thinks! There's so much drama because its so small and the academics were not even close to as good as my public school. The teachers don't encourage students and it's way to strict (which is saying a lot since my public school had security and didn't allow cell phones). It's great for elementary, but don't force your kids from 5th grade and up.
5	My daughter goes here and we absolutely love it.  In-fact, everyone we have talked to who goes here raves about what an amazing school this is.  My daughter and I did a lot of moving and she has been to many schools already in her life.  Horizon is by far the most comprehensive school she has attended.  If you are advanced in a certain area, you will be in a class with older kids who are at your level.  If you need help with a subject, you won't be left behind, you will get mandatory extra help with that subject.I can't say enough about Horizon, but be forewarned there is a waiting list and I know people who have had their kids on the list for years.  It's worth the wait once you get a child in though.
