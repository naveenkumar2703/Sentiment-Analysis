1	We arrived with my 3 year old  daughter who was so excited and nervous about her first trip to the dentist.  I told the front office staff upon check-in that I did not want her to have x-rays since she was very young and had no issues.  Just wanted a basic teeth cleaning.  This was not a $$ issue as my whole family is covered under Humana Dental.  The office staff balked at me and pulled out a binder that had information on radiation. I said I understand there is low radiation with dental radiographs as I am in the medical field, I am declining them, however.  They then said the dentist would then not see my daughter today without x-rays!  I asked if the dentist could just do a brief exam and cleaning since my daughter was counting on this today- they literally turned me down and I walked out.  Went to another dentist who did the cleaning and had no problem with my wishes.  How will they stay in business?
5	I am so impressed with Dr. Nett and the staff at Happy Valley Pediatric Dentistry.  They are very professional, yet have such a good manner with kids.  Her staff is upbeat and friendly.  Dr. Nett walked through my children's treatment plan with me, explaining everything very clearly.  I would highly recommend this practice!
