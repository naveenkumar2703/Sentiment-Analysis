4	After a hard day's bargain hunting in Ocean Terminal, you'll be glad of somewhere to sit down, relax with a cuppa and watch the kids let off some steam. Molly's is just the ticket. Nice soft play area and toddler zone with lots for the wee ones to do, and a good cafe with a small but delicious range of cakes and other food available on request.You register your child on entry and pay for the amount of time you've been in, so watch you don't lost track of the time!
