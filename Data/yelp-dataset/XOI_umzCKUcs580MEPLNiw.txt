4	Entered the store to really friendly helpful staff...The store is packed full of fun things to buy. You are able to buy the Tonto pass at this location. I need to go back just to be able to look at everything.
1	This was a horrible experience.  I walked in knowing exaxtly what I wanted, and it was an item behind the counter.  I had to wait, and and inconvience an employee to help me.  When I went to pay for it, there was 5 employees up front (with 1 register going) and a few customers waiting in line.  The employess were complaining that some of their shifts were over, and were also complaining that they don't get paid enough to work past their shifts.  So again I was inconveniencing them by try to purchase something from their store.  If I owned this place and heard or saw the staff acting like this, I would fire all of them and start over with staff who would appreciate the job
3	Very friendly service but unfortunately their stock always seems low. I tried for several different types of walking shoes and they did not have my size in any of them.So although they have great prices in the ads the actual stock is very limited.  But I always hope for the best.
4	I'm pretty happy with my purchase today. I found a pair of man's sandals and looked like it's under sale. The store guy told me it was on sale last week but no longer. Then I asked if he can do me a favor to give me the sale price and he agrees. I checked out but continue shopping for something else and got about $40 other things. I then asked the check out guy if I can return that shoes and combine all the things I want to buy so that I can use a 10 off 50 coupon. He agrees with the manager's consent and did working for a while to return my shoes and combine my stuffs together.
