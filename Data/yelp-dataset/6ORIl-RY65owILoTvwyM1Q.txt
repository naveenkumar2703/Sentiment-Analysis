5	This place and the quality of the donuts is by far the best. Not enough places besides Dunkin and Krispy K. ( both are not my fav). This Winchells is ideal location right off the 95 at Eastern; small and clean and friendly help. Just north of the freeway. Had the urge to spoil the family on a Sunday morning. Was worth the drive from North Vegas. Will make a trip back soon.
4	Great tasting, good selection, and friendly service. What else could you ask from a donut house?
5	Best donuts in the world! Lol.  Maybe not the world, but best I've had.  I went to Pink Box and was not happy.  I will always stay with Winchell's when it comes to donuts.  Try their apple filled, everyone I know that had tried these have loved them! You will too if you like apple pie.
5	Best donut chain !!!  Lives up to high expectations !!!  Been having these donuts for over 20 yrs. must stop for donuts loversMy recommendation 10.0- maple bar!!!  Best tasting maple bar you will ever taste!!! No other maple bar measures up10.0-- glazed old fashioned cruller
5	Another fantastic place on the east side.  I love to pick up a dozen for my colleagues on my way to work!!!
5	Had a craving for a donut stop by Winchell's again.  While I've had better donuts every once in awhile I get cravin these donuts.  As usual the attendee had a big smile spoke broken English and delivered me at 14 delicious donuts.
