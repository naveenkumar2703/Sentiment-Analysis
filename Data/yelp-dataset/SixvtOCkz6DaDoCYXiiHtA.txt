5	New Dimensions Automotive has been servicing my two cars for over 8 years.  I have found the staff to be extremely competent, honest, and friendly. The shop prices are competitively priced.  They are a Mom and Pop company and have repeatedly provided me with the high quality, extra-effort, go-out-of-their-way type of service that has, unfortunately, all but disappeared.  I absolutely trust their recommendations and  the work they perform on my vehicles.
5	My entire family has been taking their cars to New Dimensions for greater than 5 years. They are honest (regardless of your age or gender), and I would recommend their services to anyone.
5	I have been using New Dimensions for over 10 years.  They do the oil changes and mechanical work when needed.  They have rebuilt engines, brakes, and most everything in between on our family and company vehicles.  Estimates have been accurate for repairs.   I have never had a problem with repairs or price.  The owners and staff are friendly and good to work with.  I would definitely  recommend them any automotive service work.
