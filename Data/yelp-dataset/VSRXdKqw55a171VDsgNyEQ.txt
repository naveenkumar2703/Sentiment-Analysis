5	Dr. Earl and his staff are extremely professional! I have searched and searched for many years for the perfect dentist office and have found them in Las Vegas. I live in California and will travel when able to, to visit Dr. Earls Office. My teeth are perfect-Prices are reasonable The staff is great! I highly recommend this office for any dental needs!!
5	Dr. Earl and his staff made my (very much feared) trip to the dentist surprisingly pleasant. I'd highly recommend visiting Dr. Earl's office for any issues you have with your teeth.
5	Linda, Tammy & the rest of the staff are so sweet & gentle. The office uses the latest technology, does everything in-house, and they take most insurance carriers! I'm sending my entire family to Dr. Earl!
1	Purchased a Groupon for an exam, cleaning and X-ray. Called to schedule and they only had something available about 6 weeks out. So I said Yes and I scheduled the appointment and took the time off work. I show up on the scheduled day after driving 15 miles to get there and they have no appointment for me and tell me they're sorry but I'll have to reschedule. Complete waste of my time and money. Staff had no remorse and acted like it was my fault. Very rude.
5	Excellent doctor and staff. I don't respect any review that has the word "groupon" in it. For some reason, they always seem disgruntled. They get something for HALF OFF and somehow they feel they are critic ambassadors to "review" the place and give their stamp of approval!  I have been going to Dr. Earl for 6 years now. Dr. Earl may not be warm and fuzzy but he is genuinely a great guy and always does what is best for you, the patient.  His staff has always been professional, courteous, and more than welcoming.
