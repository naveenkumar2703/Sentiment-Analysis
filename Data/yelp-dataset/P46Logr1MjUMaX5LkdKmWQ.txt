3	Calling themselves the "pizza alternative" DP Dough does calzones.  (They're a franchise.) Their menu lists a bunch of quirky names and has plenty of ideas for fancy things you can put in your calzone. (eggs? eh?)  I don't know if it's the freshly made crust or the large wads of cheese but for $6.50 these calzones do take care of the hungry without off messing up your beer budget.
4	The calzones are decent... the cookies are phenom.Worth a shot for sure.
5	I'm addicted to these 'zones.  They have a huge menu of different varieties or you can make your own.  Every day of the week has a different special.
