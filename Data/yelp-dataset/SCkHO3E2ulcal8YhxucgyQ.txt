4	beautiful, beautiful, BEAUTIFUL clothing!i had walked by this place numerous times while on state street and had seen so many pretty things in the windows, i had to stop in.and lo!  there are more amazing dresses and skirts inside!the people that work there are pretty nice.  very accommodating -- grabbing all the hard-to-reach dresses off the wall.  the clothing is quality and just .. well.. beautiful.  it makes you feel like, for lack of a better term, a princess.it's a bit pricey for me (the dress i bought was about $40 -- although i don't spend a lot on clothes).. . but for a once in a while treat, i would definitely stop in here again!
5	I stopped in Princess of India Imports this weekend and was thrilled by all the beautiful, unusual clothing.  The lady working there was extremely helpful--she noticed what kinds of dresses I was trying on, and brought me more based on my taste and body type.  I thought the prices were pretty reasonable.  I will definitely be back here--next paycheck!
