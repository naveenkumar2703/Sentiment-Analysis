5	Say whatever you want. This school taught me well. Sure, it's a boarding school, sure it's quite hard. But it's arguably one of the best schools in Scotland and I learned so much from it. Sometimes, I wonder what would happen if I didn't go to this boarding school ... maybe I would be left in the "dark" and never knew that the world is such a big place~
