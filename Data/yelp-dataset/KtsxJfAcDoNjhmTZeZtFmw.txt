4	3.5 stars, so I rounded up.The first Saturday of the month is free, so I decided to escape the heat and visit the Historical Society museum. It turned about to be a very nice almost two hour escape. The downstairs exhibits are great. Lots of information, photos, and artifacts. Right now the exhibits are Sandra Day O'Connor, Play Ball, and a sneak peak into museum storage. Each exhibit has its own room, so there is a (usually) calm feeling as you pace around the room.Upstairs seems to hold the permanent exhibits about Western life, the Roosevelt Dam, Arizona agriculture, and Arizona life. Lots of artifacts, information, and interactive exhibits. I really wish there were more museum employees -- someone to safe guard the artifacts and the other visitors. First Saturdays are popular days with families, meaning little kids will run around and they will run into you. (Happened maybe four times today... I guess I'm invisible?) I got to the museum before noon and left around 1:45. About 1, I felt overwhelmed with the screaming and yelling young visitors, which caused me to rush through the WWII exhibit and the Desert Life exhibit upstairs. My suggestion: If you have kids in tow, come to the museum around 1. There will be a few kids to play with your kid. If you are child free and loving it, come to the museum between 10-12 on first Saturday.
4	I liked this museum a lot. You have to take into account that we are talking about a museum which celebrates the history of a state without a long history. I found interesting military exhibits, WWII history, Cactus League history (though it could have been better organized in my opinion), agricultural history, and particular a Hall of Fame along a hallway. This isn't the Smithsonian but it has interesting things to see for a very  low price of admission.
