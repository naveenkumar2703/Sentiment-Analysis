4	Had a great lunch here. Which made the trip to the "west-side" much more bearable :)Large, dark, lots of big booths. Great $6.95 lunch specials, friendly service, and good quality food. Lots of old folks here (close to Sun City)... which is good, they are less dangerous than most 'westies".I will return to "Crazy Earl's" (what their sign says) IF I ever go back to the west-side...
1	I went a couple of times before they changed the name logo,only for breakfast. It was ok. Atmosphere not so good in the main dining. If you can't put out a decent breakfast,I'd hate to see lunch and dinner-it was adequate,but not great. And too many gnats,which was a turnoff. I much prefer the little place down the street --Mercer's. Clean,friendly,better food.
1	out of business.
1	This place has been renamed to Crazy Earl's. The only item on the menu still good is the Mexican pizza. All the rest of the menu is identical to what it's always been BUT they've started using bad quality meat, like what the jail would serve if it even serves meat to the inmates.
