5	This is an old-school Hallmark shop.  It had all of the nice smells of card shops that I recall from childhood, abundant cards to choose from, decent customers, and best of all a more mature staff that was very polite.  I'm damn tired of twentysomething kids with attitudes working at places like this, looking down at their ipods while you're asking them a question at the register.  Not here, at least not on my visit.  Got a nice card, polite chit chat, and made a mental note to come here for cards in the future.  Did not meet the owner, Sherri, however.
5	The employees are helpful and kind! The shop carries a wide variety of holiday decor, gifts, wrapping supplies, and cards, so you're sure to not leave empty-handed!
5	What a breath of fresh air, this stores service was amazing, i was looking for a specific Precious Moments for my daughter and the lady did everything to make sure i got what i needed, ill go back there every time
5	This place is a knick knack haven. All kinds of goodies and cards too. Just bought my ornaments for Christmas and they had great selections. Friendly service and nice layout. A little tight but enjoyable experience.
5	I love this store. The selection is outstanding and the staff is wonderful. I was so upset when I received word that Sherri and her husband are retiring and they are closing the happy valley store and the one in Prescott. Lets all get together and open one up either in the same location or nearby. We need this store real bad...:)Now we have to go to desert ridge or Glendale. God Bless.
