5	These folks are Great! Saved me a bundle repairing some small dents in my Infiniti M35 that would have been Expensive to repair. Car looks like noting ever happened. Small Dents, no worries. Just call these folks!
5	I had a few door dings and one deep thumb sized dent in my fender.  Tony did an AMAZING job.  He did all the door dings and the fender dent for a low price and he even came to my home to complete the job.  Five stars all the way!!
1	Called this guy mid-December because I had hit a large truck tire on the highway which left a good sized dent in my door. I was heading out of town for a few days and he was very busy due to the hail storm so I agreed to call back after I was back in town to set up an appointment. When i got back in town i called him back but there was no answer, several phone calls/voice mails later i finally got a call back and we set up an appointment for a few days later. day of the appointment came and the guy was a no show. I called multiple times and left multiple messages and never heard back from him. I even waited a few days and called back because maybe the guy was on vacation or something but have yet to hear back from him. HORRIBLE SERVICE... period. I dont care how busy you are... give your customers the couresy of a returned phone call.I took my business to the Ding Doctor in Phoenix (http://www.dingdoctoraz.com/). I suggest you do the same.
4	Great results from Tony! He did a fantastic job on several small dents on my truck as well as a medium one on my hood. Can't even tell the dents were there.
