5	This is a great neighborhood (though we really don't live that close) flower shop. My sister started going here years & years ago. Then I think my mom started going. Probably my other sister. Then I became a fan.Jeff is always there. He has a great eye. He also puts up with my last minute request without issue. I know I can trust him to come up with great arrangements time & time again.My favorite thing though is to go in there & see what he has in, look at some of the vases & suggest a thing or two. Then I let him do the magic and get out of his way. That way I end up with something a bit personal but done in great style.The arrangements are always a great value as well. I will admit that I've even looked on-line recently (proflowers.com) but once they tack on all their add-on fees, handling fees, shipping, etc., there's really no reason at all not to go local.Arcadia Flowers is definitely my go to flower shop.

1	Went to pick up a bouquet for my sister in law. As I was getting my son out of the car, he runs for a corvette parked a few spots over (a seriously rad looking one too). The owner comes out screaming "you can't park here" and tells us to leave. I suppose he thought we were headed to the bar next door. I was about to tell him we were there to buy flowers, but he was so rude we just left instead.
