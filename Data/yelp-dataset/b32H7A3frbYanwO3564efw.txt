5	I really like the service at this location, it's much better than the Chandler mall location. No matter how busy this place gets you are ALWAYS greeted with a smile and a free sample. The staff is very knowledgeable about the product and the candy itself is consistently superb as expected.  When I want See's Candy this is where I go!
1	The sign says: "Closed 5/14 - 10/25"
1	NEVER GO HERE! THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS!!!!!! I wish I could give this place 0 stars!! We went in at 5:50 pm (mind you they close at 6pm), and as we were pulling in the employee put a closed sign on, and locked the doors! I went up to the door and knocked, and the employee yelled "WE'RE CLOSED!" I told her it wasn't even 6 o'clock but she didn't care and ignored us!! It turned out she was the manager Sammy.  WHAT HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! STAY AWAY!!!
