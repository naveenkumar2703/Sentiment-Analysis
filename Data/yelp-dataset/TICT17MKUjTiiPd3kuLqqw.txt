2	I agree with the previous poster.  I have been going to SNF&A about a year and a half now (every 8 to 10 weeks), and have never gotten in on time.  They are historically VERY late...and even one time a pharmaceutical rep came in, told the receptionist she was there for her "business appointment" at 4 pm...and yes, she got in on time.  Meanwhile, me with my 3:30 appointment was still waiting in the waiting room!  My other issue with this place is that they need a better cleaning crew.  I realize it's "just feet"....but I don't like being in any doctor's office and seeing cobwebs and dirty floors.  It just doesn't seem right.  On the plus side, the doctors are friendly and knowledgeable.  However, the remaining admin staff...need some serious lessons in customer service and friendliness.
5	Dr. Matthew Thomas is wonderful. I am very confident in his work. I already made an agreement with Dr. Thomas to do my other toes. Dr. Thomas is excellent. I am very proud to recommend him to everybody.
1	Awful. I have to come here as its the only place that takes my insurance.  I wish I didn't wait for 2 hours to be seen. And have the hot mess at the counter act like she doesn't care. This place is terrible.
