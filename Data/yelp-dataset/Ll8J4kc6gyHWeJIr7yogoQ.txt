4	Many after school snacks are found at the Grocery Station. Boars Head sandwiches (can't find those everywhere, and never at corner grocers!) and a good selection of chips, energy bars, beer, etc. The service is great - fast and friendly. Always a smile and friendly conversation... not some creepy guy behind the counter. What else could you want for a corner grocery shop? Would be 5 stars if there was a small selection of fresh fruit, veggies, or something like that. That's all that's missing!
5	Now called Convenient Corner Market and Deli II.Fantabulous sandwiches!Boars Head meats from RDD..so super fresh and awesomeReally fair prices
5	Great spot. For a mini market, they have a solid beer and wine selection. I ride my bike here all the time to pick up a sandwich. I have been hooked on the beefstrami for weeks. They always run a solid daily sandwich special. Full sandwich, chips, small side and drink for under $7. I recommend any sandwich you get on a sub roll. While you wait, you can play some scratchers, or bs with the guys behind the counter. Sure beats the hell out of subway!I'm thankful to have this establishment in the neighborhood. Support it!
5	Great neighborhood corner market. Great beer selection and the owners (and all the employees) are all very nice. One of my favorite spots in this neighborhood. Great sandwiches too!
5	The BEST meatball sandwiches EVER!!!! Service is the BOMB!!! I love the new owners of the Grocery Station and P.S. They are NOT closed!!! They just have new owners and they are the nicest guys, EVER!If you want to use your debit card, it's a $3 min, can't blame them there. Awesome deli. Clean and friendly. I love this place!! My kids love the cotton candy they sell there as well.
