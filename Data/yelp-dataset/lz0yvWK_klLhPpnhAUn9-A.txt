4	It's modest compared with Mary's Living and Giving, but it's for a good cause and always worth a look!This branch of Cancer Research has some nice outfits, not to mention a mini vintage section as with most charity shops in this area. It's well presented, well stocked and the shop assistants are helpful.I have collected an array of oddities from charity shops over the past wee while so I'm attemping to go easy but I always like to donate to cancer research even if I'm not buying anything. It's such a good cause, which I don't need to justify since everyone knows it, and one charity I feel strongly about. But if I find a nice piece of jewellery it's a bonus!
4	In comparison to Mary's Living and Giving this little ol' Cancer Research doesn't really get a look in. It still has it's fair share of goodies though and it's worthwhile popping into if you're in the area.This branch is well stocked, has an excellent selection of books, CD's, jewellery, ornaments and various other bric-a-brac. In addition to this, the staff are really friendly and it's a pleasant shop to browse.As Marj said, it's for a great cause and it's great to know that if you find something that you like, the money that you pay for it goes to an excellent charity.
