4	I am new to Scottsdale and this is the only Barber that I could find open on Sunday! They have hot Eucalyptus towels and give you a massage! To finish it off they put a straight razor to the hair on the back of your neck and you feel clean cut! Highly Recommend!
5	Two compliments on my haircut so far, which is two more combined than my previous 8 haircuts in this city. Found this small shop using yelp after the chain up the street had a line thing going on. Watching other people get haircuts is not usually fun. Well, no wait here and the owner cut my hair for $14. He has 40 years of experience from Russia to Brooklyn and now to Phoenix. Some solid conversation about New York ensued and before you know it the grand finale came in the form of a semi-hot scented towel on my face and head. Excellent job, will be returning. Some shaving cream and a straight edge is also involved near the end. Harmless fun. Luckily, no massage was involved as per the other review - that would have been a bit creepy from a 60 something guy.
5	My husband just got done with his haircut and he loves it he keeps touching his head! He said the barber used a minty towel and massaged his head. We aren't from Phoenix but my hubby said every time I know I'm coming to Phoenix I won't cut my hair just to get it cut there. There was no wait super quick haircut (less than 15 minutes). We will be back, thanks again!
5	My dad was visiting from eastern Europe for 5 months and he needed a haircut. Our friend recommended 48th street Barber Shop. Very happy with the visit. They are great, very professional and dad was very happy with his haircut.
