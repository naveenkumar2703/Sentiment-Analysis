3	we popped in here because of the name and because it was a gorgeous sunny day in not so sunny scotland and they had outdoor seating. a quirky local law states that you can't have a beer unless you order food and so i did. pretty standard pub grub is on offer here. nothing too bad ass. but you can sit outside and watch the world go by.
3	Apparently under new management, the Bad Ass continues to slap its novelty named charm on many Rose st frequenters.  Underneath its silly name, however, lies an all round average pub.The usual pub grub we've come to expect from the modern establishment is all here for the taking with the odd 2 for 1 offer to entice you and a chum.Their sticky toffee pudding is scrumptious too.
