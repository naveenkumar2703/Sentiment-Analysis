4	I came here to this cleaners because I also saw that they did alterations. I had to get a few buttons (clips actually) repaired on a pair of pants that I wear to work. unfortunately, the sewing had come out, and I could not repair them myself.I dropped them off on Saturday, and they were done on Monday!  I was happy with the quick turn around, as other places have had me wait up to a week for the same thing.  Plus, when I picked it up, the repair was only $4.00!!  YAY!  They offered me to dry clean the pants after fixing my clips, but I passed.  They wanted to charge me $4.25 for dry cleaning!  WTF?  Thats just about double what I pay at my normal cleaners.  So, I passed.I DO plan on coming back for other minor repairs on pants and other clothing items at this location.  I don't know if they do hems or not, but at least for stuff like buttons, clips and such I like the experience that I had here.  Will be returning!
5	My former seamstress went out of business and I was in a crunch. My parents take their drycleaning to LCS and recommended I try them for a bridesmaid alteration and they did a great job! It looked and fit great, just how I had asked and she got it done ahead of time! A little pricier than I was used to ($65 for a shortened hem, but on chiffon), but I was very happy with my experience there.
5	Kind, warm hearted, and professional.  Great place!
