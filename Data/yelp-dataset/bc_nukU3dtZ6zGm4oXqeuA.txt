4	So, I found this bagel place because its in the same shopping strip as my 'new' Fry's grocery store.I went in, and it was pretty good.  They have a nice variety of fresh bagels, sandwiches, and a nice menu selection of items to choose from.  I went with a bagel, and asked if they had lox cream cheese.  He said that he would make it fresh for me on request!  wooohoo!I really like this place better then Einstiens, and the guys there seem to be friendly and cool.   Great place to grab a bagel and a coffee on a Saturday or Sunday Morning!PS.  This is my 100th review!  go me!
2	I'm pretty sure these bagels have never seen boiling water, and to be honest they reminded me of nothing so much as the tragic frozen failbagels of my childhood.  I guess our first warning should have been the exceptionally alarming "CAPPUCCINO" poster in the window, showing what appeared to be (coffee?) chocolate milkshakes with whipped cream and chocolate. :(Two stars because it was, technically, an edible bagel, though my husband and I only managed to each finish half of ours.
4	I had a good whole wheat bagel warm and yummy with good best Seattle's coffee!! really good combination and good service. Not a fan of having bagels every day but this place is nice for once in a while. They let you chose what you want and not rush you into buy whatever.
3	This economy sucks.  A perfectly respectable Bagel Shop bit the dust.  I would have liked to have come in here, especially after finding the Rincon Restaurant closed next door.  Darn!
