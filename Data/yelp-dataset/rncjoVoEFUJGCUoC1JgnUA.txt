5	I'll never use another cheapy online tax program again after coming here. These guys are awesome and did you know paying to have your taxes done is deductible on your taxes next year? I didn't know that! They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our complicated taxes and ended up getting us back several hundred dollars more than if we had done them online like we usually do. They've earned a customer for life.
5	I highly reccomend this place. They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our taxes and deductions so that we could get the max refund. We both had been doing our taxes online and missing out on hundreds in deductions. Ill never use another online service to do my taxes again as long as these guys are here.
3	Very nice and super fast, but not very "affordable" as they say on on their website.  $125 for 20 minutes of work seems pretty high, but all and all a good place.
2	I went here last year, and although I got a larger refund than I expected, I thought the $160 they charged me for a relatively simple return was excessive! (I'm single female, with grown children, not a homeowner...seriously how easier could it be.) I won't go back this year.
