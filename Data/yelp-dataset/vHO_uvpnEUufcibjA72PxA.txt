4	When did libraries get so hi-tech? I don't even need to go to the librarian/assistants to get my books checked any more? I just put them on this little ledge and it lets me know when I need to bring it back? That is AWESOME.I popped in for a few quick read books as sometimes I don't want to spend a week or so one the one story and need something quick. The librarian was more than happy to give me a guided tour of how the library worked. With the way she was talking, the technology they are using now has been going for the last 3 or 4 years so I did feel a little silly.Modern and very well laid out and also has groups for children, teenagers and a book club for adults that runs twice a month (Group A and Group B, they aren't expecting you to read that quickly all the time)Ideal place to come and read the papers if you don't plan on spending what is the small fortune to read the news too! I fell in love with libraries when I was a child and with the way they are going now, I think I have fallen in love again although I'm still trying to work out how xbox's and Playstation's are educational..Lovely library with lovely staff, proud to have this as my local library.
