3	Ate at this place a few days ago.  I ordered lasagna and my wife ordered a burger.  The food was good, but not great.  Although the lasagna was well priced at  $16 we felt the Burger $15 was a little much.  As was stated in an earlier review the interior was very spacious and has a bar.  We were there about  7pm on a Saturday and there were only three tables occupied  (including ours).  I did like that the menu was only one page long, so it wasn't like I was reading a book
1	Walked in there last weekend to check it out- no one was at the front counter to seat us- waited 10min to be sat- place was'nt packed and walked out. Menu was very limited. Maybe they should call John Taffer to help them out.
5	Was amazed on how great the food was. Beautiful venue. The place just opened, new owner, some of the menu items appear to have changed buy still a great place for locals.
4	Order 95 ten signature drink. We loved this place. It was super cozy and the happy hour was great. Our waiter was super sweet and attentive. We will deffinatly be back
