5	Camping World is a big kid playground. While more expensive than online competitors, it is nice to have some brick and mortar. Employees are helpful, prices are good if you join President's Club.
1	If I could leave zero stars I would . Run don't walk away from Mesa Camping World RV repair/ parts/ service. Since 1/20/14 till today 4/25/14 they have been unable to make/ finish repairs to dock lights, stair cover and they broke our main cabin slide while they had it. They were unable to look at it as they were "too busy" for 3 weeks, numerous calls, no call backs, in disgust we took it to a great professional place( God Bless East Valley RV Specialists!) . The good news for other consumers? This place is shutting down for good. They never informed us since March that they had no techs competent to work on RVs!!! Case in point? Unable to fix round docking lights as "they are sealed units" !!! Really? Replace them is a concept... Disgusted. Total bill? $3,787.91
