4	Pretty good service, the cashier clerk is almost always pretty laid back and helpful. The gas pumps are plentyful, they have a really huge amount of pumps. Good selection of snacks and drinks.
2	Purchased a couple of bottled waters and handed the cashier a $20. She asked if had anything smaller. And I said "no." She got snippy and said it would take a little while before she could give me change...all the while shaking her head and cussing under her breath. Wow! Must have been a bad day for her, but jeez!
3	Gas station that has a McDonalds and is right off Centennials Auto Dealer row.  There are a large amount of pumps and the inside is kept clean. Not a bad place to stop if your close by, they offer Chevron gasoline.
5	Much better service than the Fabulous Freddy's nearby. It's a little further from my house but I'm willing to drive for good service! The workers are fast and friendly.
1	I am a huge fan of Terrible Herbst in Vegas, but will no longer be using credit cards to pay for gas at Chevron anymore since today I found out that they pre-authorized not only the $38.00 worth of gas I filled up with, but also $126.00. Chevron/Terrible's a $1 hold is more than enough! Beware!
1	Make sure if you go here for an oil change, that your oil cap is on before you leave. I noticed an oil leak after an oil change and found my oil cap laying on top of the motor. I went back again for another oil change, told them what had happened, and to please make sure the cap is replaced. Once again I noticed an oil leak and find the oil cap laying on the motor. Once ok, but twice?
1	Be very careful if you use a Credit/Debit Card here, the other night I went to get gas and the pump I was at was apparently all out? So I cancelled the transaction and moved to a different pump and for 24 hours I was charged $126 twice! Before it finally turned into $40. Man, I was about to kill this Chevron for overcharging me but luckily it was fixed within 24 hours.
