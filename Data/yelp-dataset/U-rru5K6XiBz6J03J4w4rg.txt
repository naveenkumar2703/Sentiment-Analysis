5	I have been using this cleaners for a few years and everything is always perfect when I get it back. All the employees are very nice and I've always been able to get in and out of there quickly.
1	They are always fast and cheap prices but remember not because is fast it means they do a good job and cheap$ it can cost you more at the end$$. I came some times to this place I was impressed how fast they were but I was very disappointed last time I went and recieved one of my blazers totally destroy it from a dry clean a bad costumer service from the manager/owner whom doesn't want to take any responsibility of it I never step back there
5	I've been using Bronco for a couple of weeks and have been impressed with quick service and quality cleanings.  I've done laundering and dry cleaning with happy results.  They are on my way to work, so it's a no-brainer.  I have no complaints, just clean clothes!
