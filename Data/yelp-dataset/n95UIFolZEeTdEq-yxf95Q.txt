2	This property includes: a car wash, a "safe place" station, a smog station, and is 24 hours.  It is a small yet cruddy thing when the gas station closest in proximity to your home is over-priced and lacking.  Being that they are the only gas station directly before the ramp onto the 95 highway, they have a monopoly and little reason to improve their station or their costs.There are broken pumps with card readers that don't work that have been there for years.  Buttons are worn away and the vinyl has been torn off some of the handles of the pumps to boot.As I mentioned, the prices are a little on the high side, and you may not want to be here late night as cops two to three time a night are pulling somebody over and they end up arresting them in the parking lot of said establishment.The biggest annoyance for me is when I went in to pay cash for a transaction I was met with a sales woman giving me a hard sell on a water filter who was completely unrelated to the gas station.  Who allows that to happen?  It's bad enough having to walk in to pay money because the gas stations need to upcharge you on your credit card, let alone be punished for venturing in.Save your money and find another gas station to use.
5	Only gas station right before the 95.  Last stop to fill up for awhile. Small compact easy in and easy out
1	The 2 elderly attendants are about as useful as a broken umbrella in an hurricane. bathrooms are gross.
1	The restroom was so stinky that I could smell it on the store, I'm not recommended about this gas station. .
