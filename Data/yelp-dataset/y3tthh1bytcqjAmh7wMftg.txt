5	Ask for Bobbie,  She was very helpful. I flew into airport, taxied to her office and took a U-Haul south to move my mom out.  It could not have been easier.
5	Moving is stressful enough, the Camelback U-haul location eased the process and even made the process fun.
1	WOULD GIVE NEGATIVE 1,000 STARS IF I COULD.I was PHYSICALLY ATTACKED by Brady the man who lives/works here. I went in about a discrepancy with the charges posted to my account and was met with being physically attacked. Legal actions are being taken to PERMANENTLY close this location.
1	STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION! Unless you enjoy being physically attacked by employees 4x your size.
