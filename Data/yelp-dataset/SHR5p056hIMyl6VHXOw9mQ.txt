5	The best physician (endocrinologist) ever.
5	Dr.  litchfield  is  the  best  endocrinologist  there  is  in  the  State  of  Nevada.   Quite  possibly  the  U.S.  as  well.   A  person  couldn't  get  a  better  Doctor.   He's  caring,  listens  well  to  patients  and  always  takes  his  time  with  you.    Unlike  others,  he  still  takes  new  patients.   The  time  you  might  wait  to  get  in  is  well  worth  it!   His  office  staff  is  really  great,  very  helpful.
5	This DOC is A-OK. I would recommend him and that is hard for me to say about doctors in Henderson or Vegas. He is very thorough and you can tell he is smart. His PA is awesome too. She took time to explain to me any questions I had, lab results, etc. I look forward to working with them for all my never ending Endo problems.. :)
5	I  see  DR.  LITCHFIELD  every  six  months  because  of  a  complex  condition.  He  diagnosed  me  correctly  on  the  first  visit   and  ordered  the  proper  tests  to  confirm  his  diagnosis.    He  saved  my  life.   A  very  intelligent  and  compassionate  Doctor,  he  takes  the  time  needed  to  make  you  feel  confident  in  him  and the  care  you're  receiving.   His  staff  is  really  kind and  helpful.   I  have  recommended  him  to  many  people  and  they  have  all  had  nothing  but  positive  comments  to  report.
5	I see Dr. Litchfield regularly. He's a Harvard-trained endocrinologist so knows his stuff. Nurses and MAs are nice and competent. Some of the scheduling staff can be a bit surly at times but they're probably quite busy. Overall, highly recommend this office!
