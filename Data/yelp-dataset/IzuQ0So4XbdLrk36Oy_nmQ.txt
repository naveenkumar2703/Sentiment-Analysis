5	Awesome fish and shrimp tacos for 3 bucks each! The shrimp very sweet and buttery, the corn tortilla soft and warm with cabbage, lime and slices oof fresh avocado. The fish fried in a cornmeal giving it a nice crunchy, firm consistency outside while soft and flavorful inside, try one of each!
5	The ceviche con Cameron on tostada shells is bomb! I like to remove the toppings, cover the shell with just a little bit of mayonnaise add the ceviche back on top, add some extra avacado, toss some of their seafood hot sauce on top.... Mmmmm!!! Nothing beats it.
4	Great food. The flavors are wonderful, but the "so called" salsa they give you with your chips is watered down verde sauce like something you get from Taco Bell.They don't even offer other types of salsa you could pay for except quacamole.Overall, a 4...Make real salsa though.
1	This place is beyond horrible.. Bad experience waitress was rude from the beginning... The shrimp ceviche had a hair in it and they didn't even apologize and still charged us for the food saying the hair was mine... I would never recommend this place to anyone
5	THE FOOD IS GOOD!!! I had the shrimp cocktail and the aguachile!!!! I was a little disappointed that they didn't have oysters when we came...... I've never tried them and finally got brave enough to do it but they had none oh well maybe next time Geesh I'm so full,,,,
5	Interesting atmpsphere in this place, but it's kind of cozy when you get used to it. The food is delicious. I ordered a Coke (served chilled in a glass bottle with a glass of ice on the side), a half order of shrimp cocktail (very refreshing when it's 107F outside) and the Costa Azul (Bacon wrapped shrimp). It was delicious and I had excellent service even though the place was very busy. Obviously this is a family owned place and I like to support such places. I would recommend this place to anyone.
