3	A pricy place in the airport. However we liked the club salad. And they turned it over fast for us. Good lookin' beer selection too.
3	As airport bars go, it's not too bad. food is a little more expensive than city pubs but there's nearly always some sort of ale/beer on offer. Can't go too wrong with this place
1	If you enjoy paying $20 for a dry, tasteless burger with a wee bit of wilted lettuce and poor service to boot, this is a perfect place to dine. Otherwise one could do equally well at any BK and save a few quid. Had such a lovely time in Edinburgh, shame to leave on such a disappointing note.
