2	I used to come here for my monthly pedicures, but ultimately I just didn't like sitting inside a Walmart, with shoppers constantly going by and noises drifting in- it should be relaxing! I don't avoid this place on purpose, but there are too many better choices in the area. Depending on the time of day, you may get in right away, or you might need to wait- but it's not like there's nothing to do nearby! It is very bright and clean inside. There are a few nail stations and 4 or 5 pedicure chairs. They have a TV on the wall that you can watch while you're getting your nails done. Everyone here is very welcoming and nice. I'm not too sure of the situation, but the business is run by and employs several family members. The techs love to chat you up but a few are very hard to understand. That, and I don't really have enough to talk about and usually just want to relax, so I make some small talk then break out a magazine. The service here is very inexpensive and standard. The best deal is a mani+pedi with hot stone massage that they always have on special. It's under $30, but you will be charged for anything non-basic and asked if you'd like each service as you go. The technicians are always very clean and meticulous with their work. If you get the callus removal, your feet will be baby soft afterward! No cuticles will go untrimmed. They do nice french tips but you may want to ask for a clear base polish- I think the one they use by default is too pink. You can also get nail art - they do a good job at flowers, but I haven't ever seen them do anything else.
