1	Every time I come here they mess something up. Whether it be medium instead of large, everything instead of plain, regular fries when I ask for curlies, this place does it all. Do not come here if you can help it.
4	how can you dislike Jack? If you are coming here, you shouldn't expect 5-star dining. I got what I wanted, hot, and quick.
1	Stopped by for late night taco's. Service seemed good very friendly. Got home pulled out tacos and there was a brown liquid all over the outside wrap to the tacos. It looked like something had spilled all over them. I pulled out the tacos and they were full of grease. I took them back and showed them and said this is what happens when you re-fry. And she agreed. Asked if I wanted new ones. Got a refund. In the back I see a guy making new ones. I made a comment. She asked again if I wanted new ones. Still took the refund. Told her she was lucky I did not take pics to send to there corporate office. Disgusting!
