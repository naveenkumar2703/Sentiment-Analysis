3	I was a bit confused when I saw this place, I was confused as to why I had never really noticed it before and about their collection of clothes...so I went in!The shop itself is quite small, and I was greeted by a nice man! But I felt a bit under pressure to spend a few minutes looking, I was being watched! The bottom half of the shop is for women and the rest is for men, to be honest it's mainly aimed at men, there is a far bigger selection. They sell the likes of Miss Sixty etc, some of the things are really lovely but some are a bit out there. It's quite expensive too. But hey, go have a look, there might be something to take your fancy
5	Enigma is a small shop that packs a punch.  I was passing and happened to look in, fantastic there IS a shop in Edinburgh selling Desigual.  The very helpful salesman pointed out the new range of Desigual jeans.  He also showed me the mens clothing sharp dressing that I would love my husband to wear everyday, stylish, quality, definately not high street style, quite unique and individual style.  All reasonably priced for the quality of garments.  I will definately be back.
