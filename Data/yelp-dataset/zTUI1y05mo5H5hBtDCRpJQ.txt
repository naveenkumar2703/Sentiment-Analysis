2	There was a Groupon for Papa Murphys so we thought we would try it. I'm glad I only paid $10. I've had better frozen pizza.
4	We picked up a double stuff pizza from Papa Murphys take and bake.  Not as much cheese as I would like on the second layer but the pizza was really good.  I also had them add cheese into the crust and it was really good.  I would say if you have the time you should do the take and bake.  They don't offer cooked pizzas but it was fun to pick up a fresh pizza and cook it.
4	OMG why aren't there more reviews for this awesome place? The pizza is fresh, and has tasty ingredients, and for the value you cold order 2 pizzas and be fine for the week to live off of. This place rocks. Great concept.
5	Great pizza at a great price..They have a unique flavor that is fantastic.
5	The Spinach, Artichoke, Bacon Pizza has officially made it onto my favorite pizza list!The sauce on the pizza was unbelievably tasty and flavorful. MUST TRY! I wish there was a Papa Murphy's in California, it would totally beat Papa Johns!
5	We had a pizza here about 2 years ago and were hugely disappointed. However, my mother in law had a party and served pizza from here that was amazing. We've been back twice since and each time they've been great! Can't beat the price, either...especially with the coupons they ALWAYS have online.
