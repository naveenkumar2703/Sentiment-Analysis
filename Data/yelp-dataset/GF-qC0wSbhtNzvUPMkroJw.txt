2	This store used to be a Mobil on the Run and is right in my neighborhood, so I frequent it a lot between getting gas, buy lotto tickets, or grabbing a quick bag of ice. I've been going to this place for 6 years, and since Circle K took over, I have to say I'm not impressed.  There are two employees that are there all the time; one is exceedingly friendly and the other one seems to be in perpetual misery, like a customer's presence is an inconvenience. How about a smile and a "thank you" since I drop a few hundred at your store every month between gas and the rest?  How about HAVING gas when I need it, instead of once again being out? I'm sure this store banks on the fact that people stop there because it's the closest store, but at least pretend to appreciate my business, please.  And plan ahead and have GAS; otherwise, it kind of defeats the purpose of being a gas station, you know?  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because at least the place is clean, if I do say so myself.  And yes, I'll still go there, though I can't explain why except I'm a creature of habit when it comes to filling up my gas tank...lucky for them.
