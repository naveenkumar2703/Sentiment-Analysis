5	Party of 30, tour bus from Vegas to LA. We ordered the deluxe lunchboxes and OMG they are FANTASTIC! Excellent presentation and delicious sandwich, healthy bites, including homemade cookie. They were neatly boxed up and kept cold with ice packs ready for the journey. I wish we had them in LA, because we felt spoiled by the service and the yummy food.
5	Family was in town and it was my mom's 75th birthday. I wanted to do something special for her instead of the same old average restaurants we've been doing for the past 30 plus years.I decided to reserve Sin Saveur for a nice private dinner for my mom, my brother and I. It was excellent! I'm a steak and potatoes kind of guy and Chef JP took it to a whole new level. You'll see from my past reviews that I was not impressed by other high end Strip restaurants. Well, I was impressed this time as was my mom and my brother who is also picky.Can't wait unit she hits 80. We'll be doing it again.
5	Without a doubt, the Art of Cooking is one of, if not the best catering companies in Las Vegas. I have had the great opportunity to invite several friends out and shoot an episode of The Will Edwards Show in their kitchen and showroom. My guest raved about the food, the drink, the service, the space and the creativity in their presentations. The fact that they can do large catered events anywhere in the world and intimate dinners in their own showroom is just awesome. If you have a special occasion that you want to celebrate, these folks will push it over the top for you and your guests.
