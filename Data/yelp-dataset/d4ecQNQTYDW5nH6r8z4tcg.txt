5	I LOVE Belinda's pickles. I personally enjoy the pickles with the peppers. The pickles are always crisp and filled with flavor. They always set up shop at the Phoenix Public Market. Whenever we see them there, we must buy. They are usually giving away free samples, so you can try before you buy!
5	The best pickle I have ever tasted. My only regret is finding this so late in my life. The owner was increadibly nice, too. She even held my bags for me while I went to purchase some roses (which took longer than I had expected). Belinda's Pickles are a quality product, the maker pays special attention to detail and does her grandmother's recipe proud!!!I don't know if she has a shop somewhere, I bought my pickles at the Phoenix Public Market. If you are there, DO NOT MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY.
4	We got to sample some of Belinda's pickles at the Phoenix Public Farmer's Market.  They have a terrific crunch - unlike any I've had before - in 2 flavors.  They were so good we had to buy some to take back to California!
