4	I have been here a couple of times and enjoy the laid back feel of this yoga studio. It is a nice change from the meatmaket scene at some Scottsdale yoga studios.  Classes are not overcrowded.  Teachers make you feel welcome.   It's mixed ages and levels.  The space is clean, simple, and has some kind of special air filter system to clean the air during heated yoga.  They offer basics, flow, and heated yoga.
4	This place has a small, boutique yoga  feeling that is great if you have done yoga before. The studio is clean, and the room has a great filtered air system that doesn't make you feel like you're breathing your own sweat during a hot yoga class (even though you kinda are...) I took a hot yoga class at around 6ish in the evening and I have to say I wouldn't come here if you are a beginner. The evening class was full of well trained hot yogis. The class is taught in the "flow" style similar to Sumit's Yoga (for those who are familiar with Sumit) and the teacher/part owner, Jenni was a "no fluff" instructor (which I love) and was not overly repetitive or pushy. At the end, in shavasana all the students were treated to a temple masssage with what I want to say was clover oil? Whatever it was it was relaxing and left a tingle on my temples for a good hour after, reminding me of what a good thing I treated my body to! I will be back!!
5	I LOVE Grayhawk Yoga. I try to go twice a week. I just started doing yoga about 6 months ago. My favorite teachers are Adam(who sings and plays guitar to you during shavasana and Jenni who makes sure you actually work your body. I always leave feeling amazing!
