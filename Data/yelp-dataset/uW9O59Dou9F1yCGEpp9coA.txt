5	This couple caters to your work schedule, always shows up on time, is worthy of trusting to pay in advance, and seriously CARES about what they do.I have been using Bug-N-Out for over a year now on the $20/month plan and LOVE THEM!
5	Keith and his wife are an awesome team. We called on friday night after 6pm, and they were able to schedule us in the very next day on a saturday! They have the option to do just a single spray (which a lot of places dont) - we also got an extra spray to help with fleas and ticks inside and out. we ended up signing up to do 3 months because their service was so great! Keith was very knowledgable about his pesticides as well. I would definitely recommend bug-n-out pest control to anyone looking for this type of service! A+
5	They are very professional, informative, and fast! They work weekends (even on Sunday) and work with your schedule!   I would recommend them to everyone!!
5	Just wanted to write an update - we still use this company and still love them!  It has been over two years and they have never failed to come through!
5	Keith takes care of his customers, he is on time and I have had no real issues with his service or professionalism.  Takes care of the bugs the first time, but if you need it he will come and respray.  The cricket issue I had was bad, but now its good, no issues.  The price is right and the service is even better.  I would recommend him to all my friends.
5	Great service, we tell everyone that mentions needing pest control to try Bug-N-Out!
