1	We went to this store at 8 pm they close at 10pm they were out of dark meat in crispy, they had no mac and cheese made.  they did let us get some extra chicken because we wanted three sides of mac and cheese.  The people who woked here tried very hard but just didnt seem to know what was going on.  We went in for two 10 peice buckets and it took us more then a half hour to get what we needed..  this is the second time we had been there and the service was terrible both times.
1	The last time I went in there I observed: cross contamination, unfriendly service(no two part greeting), dirty rag BUCKETS left ON THE COUNTER where they set the tongs for serving food, no hand washing by employees, and confusion with my order although it was a simple one consisting of 12 strips.Also, another customer came in while I was waiting and asked if they could prioritize her order because she was in a hurry. They said yes, but it resulted in a lot of confusion between employees which drastically slowed service time. The customer complained about the wait, which resulted in an indifferent response from a employee. He said "if you wanted your order faster you should have called it in". He said this with an attitude. Then he turned to me and asked if I thought he handled that correctly, and I said no. In the end, being a former employee of this establishment, I was very disappointed with the cleanliness and customer service.
1	This location does not have good service. Went through drive-through and they forgot our drinks and our sides. While they were preparing what they forgot, we could see another girl who had her back to us and it was obvious that she was on her phone. Any other KFC would be better.
