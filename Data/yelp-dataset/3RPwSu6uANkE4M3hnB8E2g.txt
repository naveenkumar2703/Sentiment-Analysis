4	One of the newer trends in Vegas is poolside table service in a private cabana.  Now you can be overcharged just as much during the day as in a club at night!But what most people fail to realize is that a cabana is a great option to rounding out a great Vegas weekend.  You get great service, a private area next to the pool, and your own plasma TV - all while enjoying the desert heat (at least it's a dry one)!  Don't forget that inflated ego as you ask people if they would like to join you in your "cabana" (must be said in that smarmy way reminiscent of Ricardo Montalban).The Pools & Bungalows at the Palms are relatively new, and it more than doubles the available poolside space.  It's smaller than some of the mega resorts, but I didn't see many people struggling to find space.  I would guess that there's more pool space per capita than at the Venetian or Mandalay.The staff is friendly and accommodating, and the food and beverage service is more reasonably priced than room service or the clubs.  It's easy to spend 4-5 hours in your cabana, and it will be nowhere near as expensive as a booth at a night club.Cabanas carry a day rental rate, which can be pretty hefty, unless you have a casino host who will comp the charge.  But even then, it can still be a good choice if you really just want to relax and enjoy a day at the pool.PROS:- Private area with plenty of shade and seats- Great service with no stress about leaving your stuff unattended- Plasma TV in your cabana to watch sports or a movieCONS:- Cabana rentals might be cost-prohibitive for non-gamblers- Seasonal - summer is the peak
4	Ditch Fridays, the calmer cousin of Hard Rock's Rehab Sundays. I think they wind down in September but was here over Labor Day weekend. You have to experience it, once, twice, maybe a few more times. Women were beautiful, and some men - don't let anyone say that when you're in your mid-40's you can't maintain a six-pack. 90% of all guests here were in fantastic shape. The women who are beyond-blessed, some wear g-strings and lower them below the areas there supposed to be covering, but no-one seemed offended?? Seriously, drinking shots at 12:30 PM to about 7 PM is one hell of a way to pre-game for the night festivities. Didn't get to the VIP cabanas, they were all taken ,but did see a GUY with a french-manicure!!! I am from the East coast, I am STILL in disbelief. This was more than a month ago and I can't get the image out of my head of some 6 foot something dude wearing white nail-polish on the tips of his toes. ONLY IN VEGAS! Classic - dude if you read this or if your friends read this and know who you are, you're a legend! And I don't ever compliment other men.
4	Not as good as Bare, Tao Beach, Rehab, but still pretty fun.Ditch Fridays is the only day to go.
4	Went for Ditch Fridays and to hear DJ Scribble of MTV notoriety spin in person. I always thought that he was a pompous ass with no talent. I have to admit he spun the best sets I have heard in awhile, and he did it for 5+ straight hours.If you are going to spend the whole day at the Palms pool and your not from there (and you will because there is eye candy as far one can see), its probably wise to suck it up and a get a cabana for the day. WARNING They are not cheap so bring a lot of friends or at least your most affluent ones. There is a $325 cabana use fee, and a $1,000.00 minimum alcohol fee. Meaning, you have to spend at least $1k in alcohol or they will just charge that amount anyway to your cc. Not including the 20% tip to the very friendly, very scantily clad cabana hostess. Its not at all difficult to spend that amount of $$$$ in booze. With a bottle of Grey Goose vodka at $375 a pop and Roederer Cristal at $975. The tab adds up pretty quick. The vodka does come with all the mixers needed such as OJ, Cranberry, Vermouth, Grapefruit juices, olives, lemons, and limes etc. and you even get a fruit bowl so I guess it evens out. Yeah right. We went through 2 bottles of Cristal and 5 bottles of Grey Goose. Our RIDICULOUS tab came out to over $4,200.00 and that did not include the $800 tip. OUCH!!! I need to start dating one of these cabana chicks so we can save on the gratuity...
4	So the group I am with reserved one of the VIP upper deck pools for the afternoon.  Being that it is August, it is hot, Hot, HOT!!!  no way to walk across the area with bare feet, unless you're really into burning your feet.We had a very healthy bar tab, so the drinks kept flowing, and since it is a VC group (read: mostly guys), the security guards at the base of the stairs kept sending women up to the pool, which made it much more fun. :DThe pool is pretty small, and got smaller as more women jumped into it, but it also made it a lot cozier too.  There were also two king sized canopy beds to lie on as well as lawn chairs all over the place.  It was definitely a great way to go, since we had great views from the upper deck to the 2 main pools, and the scenery was definitely nice both on-deck, and below.
5	Ah how I miss you Vegas. Some of my fondest memories come from this place, like the one time I found a $100 bill at the bottom of the pool!!! During pool season, the Palms Pool turns into Ditch Fridays. As expected, the place is a clown show: drunk tanorexic people everywhere, you know...the usual summer Vegas crowd. There are two big pools. The one closer to the entrance tends to be tamer. Tons of cabanas everywhere. Boys, get ready to dish up some dough! The dj usually spins good catchy top 40 for the crowd to listen to. Drinks are pretty expensive. People seem to like to get the drink in their souvenir cups but I personally think they are a huge waste of money. Listen up ladies, it's hard to get chairs after noon, so come early if you are with a big group. You have to flag down one of the pool boys, sometimes a huge pain in the butt when you and your girls just want to lay out or have somewhere to put your stuff. Perhaps not as "classy" as some other party pools but definitely a blast!
4	Ditch Fridays is for sure the best Friday pool party in town, and of course the only day worth coming out from the Strip to the Palms Pool. Great DJ'ing. Cool set-up.Stay at the Palms at least once and hold on to your room key so you can waltz into the pools (there's another, much smaller, one back at Palms Place) at your leisure on subsequent visits.
4	Centrally located bar, very nice pools, very friendly staff, oddly tiny spas. The day we were there wasn't that crowded, which was all the more relaxing as the cool desert wind blew through my chest hair.
5	Our waitress, Heather, was the hottest girl I've ever met in my life. We ended up just chilling in our cabana and drinking. The view was awesome. Because the pool is enclosed by buildings on all sides, we only had sunshine and little wind to deal with.Typical clientele: Gorgeous girls with petroleum based breasts and tattoo covered steroid freaks.
4	I had a ridiculously good time at Ditch Friday here on 6/18.  Lemme give you some of the basics.-Ditch Friday opens to the public at noon for $30 a guy and typically free for the ladies.-The actual pool area opens to people who have rooms way earlier, so by the time ditch opens at noon - ALL of the chairs are taken. Don't expect to get one.-Cozy up next to the pool and just lay your towel by the side.  As time goes on this place gets so packed you are lucky if your towel fits anywhere.-Be prepared to spend cash.  $45 for a bucket of 6 miller lites.  Want another beer in your bucket?  Too bad, just miller lite.  I had a vodka/cran that was $15.-There's a serious lack of staff behind the bar - you are better off to wait for a waitress to come around then to go try to flag down a bartender.-There is great clean up and security staff. Empties will disappear quickly and if you get too crazy security will be tossing you out with the quickness.We did have a really great time here - but who wouldn't?  Fun in the sun all day with awesome dj's, surrounded by all kinds of happy, social people just trying to have a good time. ****Remember to drink water!**** You can't bring your own in and they will charge you for it - but it's so easy to dehydrate out here ... especially when throwing back drink after drink like lindsay lohan after a court date.  Scram!
4	AWESOME!!! We had the best time at this place. Since we were staying at the Palms entrance was free and no waiting in line to get in. The place was packed but regardless there was eye candy everywhere. From the beautiful waitresses to the locals and tourists. The music was bangin the whole time. Meet alot of nice people that were in the cabanas. I thin next time we will get one of those. The best part for me was the house music. I was pretty much dancing the whole time. It may take a awhile to get your drinks but there is tons of people so patience is needed. Great place either way.
1	ditch fridays is WACK, its an all ages pool and if your over 21 they just give you a wrist band which means you'll be partying with kids and mostly creepy old wrinkled men. sick.
5	The spot to be on Fridays. Huge pool, lotta room to hang out, drink. Paid $30 cover
4	This review is for Ditch Fridays, and let me tell you...  Ditch, Ladies and Gentlemen, is the PERFECT way to kick off your weekend Vegas Trip!  My team of Superfriends touched down in vegas at 9am, already 5 or so drinks down (yeah, we get it in!).  After checking into our hotel and grabbing a bite at Sonic (it's a Superfriends tradition), we headed over to The Palms where we had a Cabana booked for Ditch Friday (Shout out to the homie Adam Sadie!).Upon arrival at 11:30am, I was already impressed.  Music was bangin, gorgeous women everywhere, drinks flowing...  It wasn't even noon yet!  Be careful though...  You can get really wasted really fast here...  You may not have the ability to soldier on and make it to the club that evening!  We did, of course, but we have superpowers.Pros:-Service was top notch (they really know how to treat the VIPs!)-Music was slappin' (esp if you're into mashups like I am!)-Girlies were hotter than the 100-degree weather!-2 Large pools, although one is a huge kiddie poolCons:-The $500 Cabana Rental fee!  C'mon guys.  Even Rehab doesn't have that!  I'm already spending $2-3k on bottle service.  Just add $500 to the minimum spend.  At least then I get SOMETHING for my money!-I dunked my brand new iPhone in the pool.  I know it's my own fault, but hey, it was still a damper on my day!Do yourself a favor. Ditch work (hence the name), fly in early on Friday, go to Ditch, and get your weekend Vegas trip started off the right way!
5	LOVED Ditch Fridays (at the Palms)! Best time we had in Vegas. Keep in mind that this is Friday afternoons only. If you get on the guestlist, ladies are free and one free drink - while gents are $15. I think it's totally worth the $15...compared to Wet Republic and Rehab's $50 cover charge for a pool party! Get there early - by 10am. By 12pm, there will be absolutely no chairs to lay out on - so if you want a chair, show up early. If not, don't complain when you stroll in at 1pm and there are no chairs. Besides, all I wanted to do was dance in the pool - I don't really want to sit in a chair, to be honest. But - we really had nowhere to put our stuff. People started accumulating their stuff by the benches near the water so you can watch your stuff while you party. It's better than leaving it at a random pool chair! We really had an awesome time. The place is huge, 2 pools, loads of cabanas, about 4 large bars, great looking people, drunk people dancing and partying, no one cares so much about looks - just come out and have a great time! Girls and guys dancing in and outside of the pools and splashing water everywhere. If you don't want to go inside the pools, you can wear your bikini and heels outside the pool and dance outside. Drinks of course are super expensive. $13 for a long island iced tea - VERY strong, though. I think $45 for a bucket of beer (5 beers). A large Fiji water bottle is $8.Really cool place. I was impressed and we loved it/had a blast!  I hope it's still around when I go back to Vegas.
2	Is there something up w/ the end of summer and the quality of people dropping to 4s and 5s? I've been to the Palms pool before pool parties were the in thing. Since the last 4 years have brought the day party to the pool, i have high expectations. I expect to hear good music, with a DJ that can cover the spectrum of music to cover all tastes. I expect to see HOT girls, and Men's Health Cover type dudes. And the rest of the regular crowd, i expect friendly people from all places, out to have a good time. This was not the case here. I have NEVER stayed at a pool party for less than 2 hours, until now. Cover is good- 30 for guys, free for gals (on this day). They layout of the place was OK, nothing spectacular (keep in mind i was at opening weekend at Beach Club at Encore so the bar is set high). Drinks were $15 each, but it was a decent pour (ketel1 Rocks!) There really wasn't anyplace to sit, and the staff wasn't very inviting. Usually I've experienced staff checking on people and at least trying to get you a seat for a "nominal fee". There isn't a lot of shade for the regular Person, unless you are will to pay for a cabana.
1	Over rated by far, used to be fun 3 years ago.  Even with free cover or getting hooked up to get in the drinks are way over priced, and there is not enough alcohol in the drinks to warrant 10 bucks a pop.  If your going just for women the sights are good, but seriously they are good at every pool in vegas...
4	Sunday pool party is nice at the Palms pool. Good music, sun tan and no hassle with over crowded meat heads and stiletto heels in my way....
4	Went to Ditch Friday party that they have here. You gotta get there early to get a lounge chair. The security staff here is excellent. Our server sucked, she would come around to our table maybe once every hour or so. After ordering pitchers & bottles @ our prepaid table of all places, we would wait forever for her to return & on many occasions we would see her about thirty minutes later taking drinks to random people in the pool while we were still waiting for our drinks. The atmosphere here is hot though & definitely worth attending.
4	One of the best pools in Vegas. Always a party!Even on the days where there is nothing special going on.Music is loud. Crowd is fun (but not crazy wild like other places).Only problem is that it gets really busy so waitress service sometimes can be VERY slow. Still my favorite though for regular days (aka: non holiday weekends, non special events - on those days it's too dam crazy)
1	I was debating on giving this two stars, but I've decided to give it one. I usually don't give one stars unless there is something *really* off about the service and the whole atmosphere, but I couldn't help to do it with Ditch Friday at The Palms pool.Being a Vegas local, I was *extremely* shocked to see how *small* this pool is. For a casino resort like The Palms, I was expecting something that was as just as good as the reputation the casino gets. There are only two major pools here; one considered the "main" pool, the other a slightly more colder pool which is around the bungalows, DJ, and cabanas.You have to get here very early enough to snag a chair, and due to how small the pool really is, they are closely packed together and you really don't get any personal space (I understand most pools can be like this with the chairs, but here it just seemed *really* claustrophobic on all four corners!) I didn't have any problem getting in since I was a local, but when I arrived at 10:30AM there seemed to already be a long line on the inside.With the two bars, they are very understaffed for the volume of people there. Also, the cocktail waitresses seemed to be more concentrated around serving at the pool closest to the bungalows instead of the main pool, which I thought to be a little odd? The drinks itself are unique, but I felt like the mixed drinks were more sweetened than a real drink to enjoy by poolside.This is a pool more for the show and glamor of beautiful people of Las Vegas. There were promoter models who strutted out the day I went and were walking around in their heels taking memorable Vegas pictures with tourists. Unless you're into catching some eye-candy, I'd say there are *definitely* better pools elsewhere in Vegas.
4	I came here for Ditch Fridays at the Palms this past Memorial Day Weekend and it was pretty fun! I'm not sure if there's an entrance fee but if you have a connection with a promoter then it's free! Ditch is located at the hotel pool right by Rain Nightclub, and it is heavily guarded by security and a well organized team of promoters.. There are two pool areas and it is best to arrive early if you plan on sitting poolside.. There are a few small bars and one main bar in the middle with a shaded area.. If you entered as a VIP guest then you receive a card from the promoter check-in table for a complimentary drink.. They have many lounge chairs and cabanas but some of them are located in terrible spots.. It is definitely best to get one by the main pool in the back! My favorite thing about their pool is the flat level just before the stairs where you could dance with just your feet in the water.. The music was a mix of top 40s and house music and they had rapper Tiny Tempah perform a few songs.. If you're looking for a more-so low key pool party to dip your toes in before you try out one of the big boys (Rehab Sundays at the Hard Rock) then this is a good place to start [:
4	Really awesome place for a pool party.Get here early, because it gets crowded, especially weekends.Waitresses are better looking than most hotels. Small waist, big ta-ta's.The set up of the area is cool. They have upstairs & downstairs. 2 big pools.LOVE their chairs. They have cushions! And are super comfy.It's always nice & relaxing here. The weekends w/ special events or famous DJ's can get super crazy though, so do make sure to come EARLY!
4	I had a blast here and found it to be deserving of my 300th review!We talked to some promoters and got 8 girls in to Ditch Friday for free, with a free drink ticket each! The promoter lied to us and said we could have a free daybed with our bracelets, but it turned out they weren't special bracelets. Lame, but his fault. The free drinks were Palomas (tequila and grapefruit based) and another drink of OJ, orange vodka, and something else. Pretty refreshing in the heat. I bought a pitcher of delicious strawberry mojito too, for $45 and it served 6 girls. I like the way there are two levels of cabanas and couches, two big pools, and it never feels crowded. It was a fun, non-pretentious atmosphere of people who just wanted to have a good time.
5	Went here for Ditch Fridays, which was amazing.  I was here later on, and everyone was drunk, but fun and it was quite a scene.  Expensive drinks - $10 and up for a beer can?  Great music, fun atmosphere, every type from the really good looking to the eh. Special props to security for free use of a day bed - they were very nice and chill about everything here.
4	Wish I were there right now ... sun shining down, cabana to chill in, free flowing liquor and amazing friends. Damn, that was a good day.We were in a cabana here for a good friend's birthday, and it was a crazy fun, yet still somewhat sane Sunday afternoon. The pool wasn't packed, it was pretty chill, but had a good crowd and perfect weather.All in all I would totally come back here. Drinks at the bar were expensive, of course, but it's Vegas! So worth it. And the cabanas were comfy & stylish. Also love how this pool has little ledges you can sit or lean on, so you can stay cool while not immersing yourself. Sweet.
4	This pool is bumpin on Fridays and Saturdays. Lots of people and music.You may want to get there early though if you wanted to snag some chairs.Drinks are expensive though. $9-$10 for beer.
5	Ditch Fridays was my first pool party in Vegas and damn, I definitely got buck WILD haha.My girls and I were on the guestlist and we waited no more than 10 minutes to get in. We also received drink passes upon admission and got our drank on :)The pool place is huge and there's hot & diverse bodies everywhere. The music was bumpin Top 40's and House (my faves) and it was a big drinking party in a spacious pool pretty much :DI will definitely come again for the craziness and the social atmosphere it holds down while the beach balls get tossed around :)
3	I've stayed at The Palms quite a few times in the last couple of months. I always try to get there in time for Ditch Friday. The pool party is complimentary to hotel guests - and it never fails to deliver a good time. The pool area is large, and comfortably spread out. There's plenty of room for all, at least until about 4PM, when it starts getting packed.There are some downsides. Alcohol prices could be better. Better as in: paying $70 for 5 beer buckets is just a bit much. I recommend getting to know one of the bartenders, or getting sauced in your room before hitting the party.Aside from Ditch Fridays, this pool is lovely on other days - not to mention much quieter and more relaxing.Another thing to be aware of - this pool closes fairly early. It is usually shut down by about 7 or 8PM (not sure which), in order to give the cleaning crews time to prep it for the following day.
2	Came here for Ditch Fridays during Labor day weekend-had Dj Pauly D spinning and he got the party going :)-all the guys looked like they stepped out of the jersey shore show-bought the couch/table bottle service.  It was smack dab under the scorching sun and asked for an umbrella and it never came.  So, like a fried egg, I fried under the heat.  Half the time I stood in the shade in  some corner-it was the holidays so as you can imagine, there were A LOT of people.  another reason I did not want to step into the pool, the water was a murky color eww
3	Came to Ditch Friday Labor Day weekend and had a blast.Now for what I liked about it.  You didn't have to wait in a crazy ass line for 10 hours (we got in 10 minutes), it was $60 vs $100, drink prices were reasonable, and the music was REALLY GOOD (DJ Pauly D did an excellent job)... But, I got to keep it real, imo, its not on the same level as Wet Republic!  WR is just crazy ass fun and everyone is super fit, best of the best kind of crowd!  DF is more so for anyone, fit or not, its just more chill.  I would definitely go back...
4	I wanted to go to Ditch Friday but didn't get a chance. I went on a Sunday that started off very sunny but by the time we got there rainy :(The pool was pretty empty since the rain was off and on. I assume everyone was trying to get into Rehab. We had a pretty crazy weekend so we didn't mind the chill vibe. The music was awesome.. Top 40/Hip hop. Drinks were great.. Try the Frozen Mango Mojito.. so delicious!I want to come again and see how it is on a busier day.
1	This review is based on the service of Palm's Pool. I was interested in getting a daybed or cabana for Ditch Fridays for my girls and I. We aren't coming to Vegas until Aug but I wanted to get a price range to compare it to another pool party or two and see if it was worth it. I've called 3 times (they have no voicemail) and I've sent  2 emails. No one has ever returned a email and they NEVER answer the phone.Thanks Palms for making my choice that much easier! :)
5	Had a great time here on the first Saturday of the season! A few friends and I rented out a cabana for my Bachelor Party. Our server was Rae and she was amazing! Very good at her job and easy on the eyes. Anything we needed we had promptly including some cigars we requested. They had a cigar cutter and a matches ready for us anytime we needed them. We also never felt pressured to order more bottles once we started to run low.The party itself was off the hook. They had a great DJ and the place was packed with a great crowd. A lot of ladies! I would definitely recommend coming here, especially if you reserve a private cabana. They are outfitted with a flat screen TV and a large seating area that could probably fit about 8 comfortably.This is a great party and I'll definitely be back!
3	The positives - the pool is large, so there's room for everyone. You won't need to wait too long to get a lounge chair. I like the layout/setup and it's a cool place to hang out. Admission was free, and they play some fun music, and we had a good time hanging out here for a couple of hours. I had fun.The negatives - they check your purse before you go in. I hate places that do this. It bugs me. None of your business. Target, Ralphs, every single restaurant in the country, and various other establishments seem to function just fine without having to rifle through customers' personal belongings, why can't a swimming pool figure it out? They confiscated my chewing gum because they said it could be drugs. I shit you not about this one (although I'll give one of the security guys some credit - he let me take 2 pieces in when I expressed incredulity and annoyance). Drinks are ridiculously overpriced (although, not more so than the rest of Vegas). I asked for the darkest or hoppiest beer they had at the bar, and they said, "that would be Sapporo." Sapporo? That is not a motherfucking dark or hoppy beer. Bitch, please!
4	When my friend told me she wanted to go to the palms pool I was kind of hesitant since I'm not a fan of the Palms. We came and a Saturday and I was like wow! It was an awesome huge pool party. We arrived around 1pm and we were able to find a spot to put our stuff at. There are 2 separate pools. Lots of cabanas and lily pads. My friend's bf knew the djs that were playing that day, so when they arrived we were able to hang out in their cabana. We saw a dance off with some asian guy and a group of guys in a cabana and some girl doin cartwheels. It was madness.I had such a good time, but one thing I didn't care for were the drinks. They use a jigger! I've been to several pool parties/clubs in Vegas and none of them use a jigger. Stop being stingy if you are charging that much for a drink and located off the strip.
4	We were here recently for a friends 40th bday, and we had a loarge group of us, 20+ people. The first day was Saturday, and we got a daybed by the back pool, and out server's name was Cami. I cannot say enough good things about her, she completely made the experience. She was attentive, friendly, funny, and over all FUN! The second day we had a cabana near the front pool, and that was nice as well. The service was good, but not as great as Cami. We still had a great time, the servers come around and make sure everything you have and want is there for you. One of the things I thought was funny, they come around and straighten your stuff, shoes, clothes, ect, they will even fold them. I initially thought it was a little much, but  I learned to appreciate it, not only does it make you feel looked after, but it keeps everything looking nice and classy. Nice touch!
5	Went June 12th. Guess Dj Jazzy Jeff. This place rocks. Got there just before noon. No crazy line to wait in or hassels. Got right through the ropes, got towels, and found some chairs. The place got packed quickly. The area is a little small and can feel smaller with the large crowds. But that is also a good thing. It made it real easy to meet people.Buckets of beers are $50, but its Vegas. Drinks are always steep unless you gamble. I recommend you get a daybed or meet another group and share a daybed with them. We ended up meeting a small group and they let us cruise their daybed area.Drink lots of water. It is hard to do the pool party and nightclubs in the same day. We didnt make it out that night. But pool partys are better. Its light outside so you can see if the person you meet is ugly. She cant really hide her face in makeup or body with clothing. If you meet someone you know what you are getting. Plus everyone is almost naked. Screw nightclubs, go to the pool party. If this place is still poppin next year we will definately hit it up!!
2	Been to Ditch Friday twice now and I have to say I'm not impressed... Friday pool parties are hit or miss in Vegas but this place does not come close to the hype. The V card didn't work because they claimed the DJ was known for something and that made it a "special" event.The only way I plan to go back is if there is a real performance. Other than that I will not make a point to get to Vegas early enough to hit the Palms...Bottom Line: If you want to hit a pool on a Friday it's a crap shoot, don't go out of your way to hit Ditch.
4	This by far is the most fun pool scene in Vegas. The only star off is for the ridiculous price of drinks(10 bucks for a Tecate? Where I live you pay like 2-3 bucks for a Tecate) . I went to Ditch Friday with DJ Jazzy Jeff and had the best day I didn't want to leave. We luckily snagged free chairs and had our stuff guarded by the amazing bodyguardbouncer dude Paulo who we all wanted to adopt as a friend. Everyone is hot, the music was great, the area is so big so you never get cramped , and I love the mist as you wait for drinks. One other neg...those bathrooms are disgusting. get it together . Other than that super dooper fun and when I'm ready to go back to vegas in another like five years I'm coming back here!
3	heat... water... towels... liquor ... bikinis... sexy people....all here at the pool and any Vegas pool.. in all actuality ...the pool is huge... lots of cabanas and daybeds.....arrive early.... on a non-party day...the play list was amazing.....  great service from the waitstaff ...  -- expensive drinks.... expect nothing but that in Las Vegas......  not family friendly later in the day.....  parents should take their kids to the pool at Palms Place -- which is somewhat hidden and unknown if your you're not staying in the Palms Place tower! -- be sure to ask at the front desk....
1	Went on a Saturday in the 100+ degree Vegas heat. I was told I coudn't bring in my water bottle and had to pay $5 for one of their bottles, SERIOUSLY! Oh and they don't give you cups of water. Drinks were $15. The servers only come to the daybeds and cabanas which were $500+. The music and scene was not worth it, NO THANK YOU, never again!If you can get into Palms Place pool, do it. Better music, better chairs, better service ;)
4	This is a raging pool. Everytime I go here, I have a blast!
4	The Ditch Pool Party at the Palms is one of my absolute favorite things to do on a hot summer day in Vegas.  I'm not one of those people that is spending thousands on a cabana (wish I could), but the staff here was nice to everyone.  Everyone here is here to have fun.  Of all the times I have been here I have only seen maybe a few unruly people (It's VEGAS!) but security has always been on top of it.  Drinks are a little pricey but that's why you drink in your room a little before hand! =)  Can't say enough nice things about this place....clean, good music, good drinks!
5	Love this pool! Ditch Fridays is an amazing party and brand! The host staff is superb and like other pool parties they treat people with amazing customer service.  Oh did I mention their cocktail staff is beautiful and helpful.
3	The palms pool is pretty cool! I love that they have parking right below the pool so if you don't want to valet and wait hours when you're ready to go to get your car, self parking is an option. The pool itself is pretty fun. I enjoyed the music and the crowd was cool. Pretty diverse with a great upbeat vibe. The police walking around in their hunter water proof boots were cool as well and the attention from servers never ceased. Spending the day there for a friends birthday turned out to be a great time. Bonus: The food is pretty good as well. I was starving and they managed to curb my appetite!
5	My girls got me a cabana on Friday for the Pool Party. It was nicely situated right by the hot tub! Loved it! The attendants were very nice and friendly. More importantly, they were very attentive. The cabana was decked out with tv, lounge chairs, and outside bed. It was perfect to move straight from cabana to the pool. I enjoyed the music(mostly hip hop). The black eye peas Dj was on the 1s and 2s when I was there. We stayed from 1130-5pm literally. It was the best time!!
3	It's alright. They wouldn't let us bring in chips or water which was ridiculous. We were stuck eating that crap hummus plate from harraea that cost $15. If you looking for a party it's ok for that.
2	We had a cabana service - definitely need one if you want to stay cool from the heat.  They had TV inside the cabana which would be great to watch sport or movie.  You can order Food/Drinks and listened to good music (Top 40s music)  Good size pool, I believed there is two!!However there were no live DJ's so it was kinda boring compared to other Pool Party.... probably would not be back...
4	Went to Ditch Fridays here.  It was a lot less packed than we expected, but still a lot of fun.  The pools are beautiful and the music was awesome.  Drinks were expensive as expected but worth enjoying.  I imagine if it was extremely packed, it would have been out of control, but even with less people there, it was a good chill experience.
4	***Ditch Fridays Review***I came here a few weeks ago with a group of people.  We had tickets/on a list so we were free.   Rolling VIP status and Ludacris performing that day is pretty much the extra star boost.It was crowded but surprisingly not stupid packed.  There was enough room to get into the pool if you so pleased but I stood by the stairs so I could IG photos and mingle if the time called for it.I don't know what seating, if any was free besides the regular pool chairs on the outskirts of the pool.  The music was really cool (Top 40) and the people were all pretty chill. I plan on coming here next Friday with my cousins.  All girls so hopefully we get in quicker and what not.My only grip is the drink cost.  I wanted the Ditch Fridays water bottle for my drink and seeing that the cups of alcohol were $13, I thought ok the signature water bottle will probably be like $20.  WRRRRONG!!  She made my blended drink, tossed it in there, and said, "$36"  W.T.F!  Ah hell naw.  I gave her $40, said keep the change, but I was thinking are you kidding me?!  That much of a price difference.  To make it worse, I drank half of it and I was not tipsy/buzzed, and the rest had already been melted and was no longer cold. AND then I went back to her later on before I left so see if I could get water in it and she told me they can't put water in there and only offer water in water bottles. Really?? I spent $36 and you cant fill this up with ice and WATER?!FYI on the water bottles: $5 for a bottle smaller than your hand!  Not worth it.Totally not worth it.  Buy the regular size cups for alcohol.
4	A few friends and I swung by the pool around 4pm today in hopes of laying out for a few hours. We managed to acquire a day bed at the furthest end of the walkway for a cool $100 food & bev minimum, an all day rental is only a $200 minimum. We had a really great time, both drinks we ordered were really good. Blueberry Mojito: Sweet, refreshing, perfectly minty, not too sweet. It was a little spendy at $60 a pitcher, but not at all regrettable. Italian Lemonade: A little sweeter, but that was expected but completely smooth. Slightly above average drink. We got a souvenir cup for $36 and it was easily split perfectly among 3 cups. Overall, definitely worth the $115 total price tag we spent over the 2 hours we spent there.PROS:Great price on daybeds, which made our day at the pool much sweeter.CONS:Prices on drinks are somewhat steep, but aren't too awful. Pool closed at 6, which was earlier than we expected.Overall, would definately go again.
1	ghetto artists expensive go somewhere else
5	I had a lot more fun this time at Ditch Fridays.  Mostly because my two free drinks got me a bit twisted and I felt accomplished that I planned this Vegas trip and we got into ditch Fridays with no hassle and within MINUTES.SIDENOTE TO ALL:  Please use Chris Hornak's services for anything Palms related!http://www.yelp.com/biz/free-vegas-club-passes-las-vegas(I will be reviewing him and his yelp page)Ditch Fridays was much better this time around for two reasons: Less crowded and less ratchet.  I'm guessing Ludacris brought out the crowd last time I went.Thanks to my wristband with two free drinks, I was on 10.  A miracle how two small, cheap tequila and sweet & sour drinks can get me lit as opposed to their wack ass $36 drink that did NOTHING for me. I was all up in the water this time, we had an area to put our stuff down near the pool, and my cousins enjoyed themselves.  Music was pretty cool.  Hip hop through most of the visit and I met some cool people this trip.Ditch Fridays and Chris Hornak's list is where you need to be.  Ladies!
2	Meh.. This pool party was mediocre, maybe because we're living the life this weekend!! Ballin on a daybed and spent a shitload on alcohol here! That's what happens when you hit this place right after you land.A little bit of eye candy only, a fight in the pool between two chics, so that's the crowd here...Do another venue if you don't wanna get into a fight! haha!
2	I'm very frustrated with the Palms pool. First of all, we were comped a cabana from a previous trip, but when we got there they gave us the choice of a day bed (which we took and was pretty nice) or a cabana totally on the other side by the closed pool. What the heck?  The kicker was they had open cabanas by the main pool but they were reserved for people who paid $$$.  Ok, fine, I understand that, but the guy (Frank) lied to us and said they were already reserved rather than be truthful and say they were for people who paid only. That would have been fine but being lied to was not cool (2 of them remained empty all day long). Then we instead got a daybed, ok, cool, it was nice and we had a waitress named Alana.  She was super cute and seemed nice but turned out to be a total scammer in the end. I'll spare you the details but she basically was trying to scam us by upcharging a drink. So our bill came to $20 too much and it should have been an easy fix. She suddenly turned into this totally buttface about it (over 20 freakin dollars) and we had to get the manager involved. He eventually refunded our money. I wasn't even trying to be an ass or bitter and even tried to tell Alana that it was all good and no worries and she ignored me like I was some kind of freak and was a total bitch. Wtf??! I was trying to be nice and she was a total shitbag about it. I'd say the pool was cool but be very weary of ordering service through them. Side note: the manager was nice and a pool dude name Richard was way cool.  drama or not. In the future, I'll pass.
4	Went during the week and it's lively with just the right amount of people, sexy people and staff.  The drinks are pricey but you can bring in your own in a TO-GO cup.  I like the layout and they played good music...nothing obnoxious.
3	I can see why people like this pool, and I can see why people don't. The crowd will  definitely depend on the day- and  you should definitely pay attention to who is performing to determine whether this will be the pool for you. A girlfriend and I went on a day when Tyga (hip hop artist) was performing.  We're hip hop fans, and we got comped so that was cool with us- the music fit, and we knew what to expect in terms of the crowd.  I can see how someone else, less familiar with that artist might be frustrated with the experience.  The actual performance was maybe 20-30 minutes, toward the end of the day (maybe about 5pm), but the real action was just in people watching.  Drinks are expensive, but that's to be expected, and if you want to have a better experience, you'll need a cabana or daybed.  That's typical for most venues, though.
4	The cabanas are actually kind of weak for the price on Fridays. What wasn't weak was the service we received from Sydney, she was super cool, attentive, and friendly. Kudos to our host Trehy for setting us up and taking care of us during our weekend there.
4	My group of ladies came to the Palms Pool specifically for the Midsummer Lingerie Party which was sponsored by Playboy. I seriously need to put that on my calendar for 2014 because I don't want to miss the next one!Ok I know I'm pretty straight and all but I was surrounded by so many gorgeous women in breathtaking (and dare I say sexy as ****!) costumes that it was turning me on. I have tons of pictures with them but I wasn't sure if posting them would be very relevant to my review since I'm pretty much only showing off hot women and not the pool, haha. Seriously can I have a job where all I do is walk around looking gorgeous while in costume making everyone around me feel like mere mortals? Sign me up for that!Loved the layout of the Palms Pool. It's very spread out and has several areas where it's only 9 inches deep creating little "islands" for the daybeds. These little 9 inch strips also serve as a great place to take off your heels and dance in the cool water without getting anything high up wet. The DJ for the evening did a really good job of keeping those girls moving on stage. I can personally blame him for lodging "Bubble Butt" into my brain along with images of some amazing badonkdonks.Fun pool and I expected nothing less from Palms. Everyone seemed to be having a great time during the party, some more so than others. Apparently most of the women who were there not hired to be in costumes were hookers so... yeah... if that's your thing gentlemen, you know where to go (not that I am condoning prostitution and besides, it's illegal within Las Vegas city limits anyway... don't ask me why I know that).
4	Would've been 5 Stars but they don't have a pool lift.A very cool space, nice staff, good food and drinks. All of this made for a couple of nice relaxing afternoons sunning by the Pool.
4	If you go when it's not too crazy packed, I enjoy this pool. It's got a good amount of pool space and an ok amount of seating. I personally like the round bed seating that is actually in the pool. Drinks are naturally expensive and over-priced. Music is ok. Pretty nice cabanas. But, and perhaps most importantly, there's no cost to enter. A free pool is always my kind of pool. So in sum, this is a great place to swim and relax.
1	Just checked in and have spent about 2 hours on the game floor with absolutely No waitresses coming by for drink service.  I expected more service.  Seriously regretting staying here.
4	I love hanging out at this pool!  I spend everyday at this pool while in Vegas.  Ricky, Jodi and Misty always do a great job!  Love them! There is one host that isn't great...contact Ricky if you want to be taken care of...see you guys soon!
2	This place was cool about 5 years ago, but now it is lame. Sucky greasy bar food, ruff almost scary crowd, minimal service even to high dollar spending cabana customers. With all the party pool options in Vegas I would leave this one off you list.
1	I've been coming to the palms pool for the last 3 years and it used to be my go to spot for the pool parties I loved it. However this year management changed. The bartenders are the rudest I've ever seen. The fat guy with the bald head to be exact. They don't play hip hop and no longer bring in hip hop artists there cocktail servers are rude too. It's a shame! I'll never go there again for the rest of my life let alone spend my money there or tip rude bartenders. They all need to get new personalities!
4	I actually enjoyed this Pool Party Ditch Fridays! No cover charge, music was good, ambiance was good! Food & Drink are always expensive I mean its Vegas!! But when you get in free, why complain!!
5	Had a blast here! Attended "Ditch Fridays." It's so much fun. They had different blow ups in the pool, only downside sometimes peoples drinks get knocked. A blast though!!!!
1	Pool is good except wanna be cops aka security guards and their dress code restrictions. F**k those wanna be cops.
5	Love it here....was a good time!!! Buckets of beer and reasonably priced food. Wished the daybeds were a little cheaper but a very good time. Customer service is excellent.
2	Did I have a good time here with a bunch of friends that were staying at the same hotel? Yes. Would I ever come back to this pool otherwise? No. I ordered a fruit plate and 2 bottles of water in the morning. Waitress told me $21 but didn't hand me the bill..... I decided to take it from her hand and look for myself. The bill was $20.10 and stamped across the top "GRATUITY INCLUDED". The day before we had been ordering food and cocktails and tipping our servers all day, but I did think it was weird we never saw our tabs. Smart on their part, but you may want to check for yourselves. We were there mid-July. It seemed pretty slow during the week and the pool party wasn't as insane as I had remembered a few years back. My opinion... clientele was a bit ghetto. For the money you spend at this pool, you'd expect some swankier patrons. Water wasn't freezing, actually quite comfortable, a definite plus!
4	I was staying at the Palms Place so they gave is wristbands to get into the Palms Pool for free. We were told to arrive anywhere from 10-12 otherwise we would have to pay the cover charge. My husband showed up at about 10:30 to Ditch Friday and did not have to wait in line at all. When we were in there were quite a few lounge chairs open yet so we quick grabbed one and got drinks. He got a bud light and I got a watermelon cocktail and it was about $25, so average for Vegas. The lounge chairs were in the sunniest part of the pool so it got HOT. My husband ended up going inside to play blackjack after about 20 minutes. I lasted a little over and hour before I needed to go inside. When I left there were more people starting to come but still was not busy. I would definitely return if I stay at the Palms again but otherwise I think I would check out a pool party on the strip.
3	You aren't allowed to bring in a Go-Pro, so don't even try. They say it's because people have come in with them and making movie for their own personal gain and businesses. At least we were able to check it in with the bell desk. Music is mostly rap & hip hop with some EDM mixed in. Mostly a Black crowd. The setup is really pretty with a waterfall by the bar. The overall energy of this place though was just... OKAY. Probably wouldn't come back here again.
