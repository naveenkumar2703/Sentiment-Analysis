3	The muter paneer was a bit runny for me but tasted ok.  As main entree I had the karahi murghi keema massalla, which was good but not awesome.  It's somewhat odd to see only western dessert in the menu, but nevertheless the one I had (something with biscuit and ice cream) was excellent.  Will give a try again in the future.
4	Close to the Marriott, easy walking distance, but they deliver for anything over 12 pounds (order online!).  Food arrived fast and very hot!  Food was good quality for the price - spicy mushrooms were excellent!http://www.abida-restaurant.co.uk/home
