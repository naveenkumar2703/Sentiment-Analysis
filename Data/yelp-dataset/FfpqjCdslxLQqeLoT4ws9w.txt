4	Good place to go if your hungry.You get quite a big meal with burger king.Its located in waverley station so its good for grabbing a burger king and eating it on the train if you are going anywhere.
4	Ok. I'm going to level with you here. This place has saved my life on many, many occasions. I have a few friends in Glasgow so I take the train back and forth regularly, usually hungover, so this is the fatty, yucky food I need in that position.Ok, it;s Burger King, it's not exactly going to be Fois Gras, but it's delicious nevertheless. People have a go because it's not healthy or whatever, but sometimes you just need it. You know what  I mean....right?
3	So why reviewing BK when you can find so many great burgers in Edinburgh pubs?Let me tell you why. I am French and Burger King closed all their French branches in 1997 due to slow business and the fierce competition of McDonald's and the Franco-Belgian chain "Quick".Since then, Burger King has become some sort of cult burger chain that every French traveller wants to experience when abroad. Even Eurostar based one of their adverts on the fact that the nearest BK to Paris is only 2.15hrs away in London [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EGvTtXGpAI forget the cheesy music, it's deliberate].So it's impossible NOT TO visit Burger King regularly for the reasons above. Also, it actually tastes better than McDonald's. One thing though... BK reopened a branch in France, in Marseille Airport, on a day of December 2012. So maybe the place will lose a bit of its cult status after all? We'll find out soon...
3	For years I passed this outlet and even back then there where pigeons in the restaurant area scouring the floor devouring the left overs.I don't even think the staff even bother sweeping the floor any more.The food is nothing to Bragg about and you still have to wait.
