4	I attended a wedding at the Overlook Pavilion and it was absolutely breathtaking. The desert views were outstanding. The service was great and the catered food was very good as well. I don't have too many details about this club but from what I have experienced with the aesthetics of the venue, the views of the valley, the service and quality and taste of food I would recommend it for any special function.
4	I played this golf course for the first time last week.  I am very impressed.  So far, it's one of my favorite golf course in Arizona.  Here's why:+ The course is kept in great shape.  Fairways, excellent and the greens were soft and rolled true.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eagle-mountain-golf-club-fountain-hills?select=UqYXQGNAtScIvcVrmMo1Dw#UqYXQGNAtScIvcVrmMo1Dw+ The design of the course is challenging but offers a nice option of distances from the various tees....this allows for a nice variety of options for various skill levels in the same group to play together.+ I love the rolling hills and changes in elevation.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eagle-mountain-golf-club-fountain-hills?select=cmmUzMXaihxf5keZpadxLA#cmmUzMXaihxf5keZpadxLA+ The greens are fun to putt on...they're not flat and offer a challenge on all putts.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eagle-mountain-golf-club-fountain-hills?select=50NZhNK5YNoVMm8ipX3s5A#50NZhNK5YNoVMm8ipX3s5Ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eagle-mountain-golf-club-fountain-hills?select=7LDMLKsddbQ816uGBZW_jA#7LDMLKsddbQ816uGBZW_jA+ The views of Phoenix are spectacular.

5	Challenging layout. Beautiful lanscape. Well maintained. My favorite course. Plan to return.
4	Great Course with amazing view of the best of what AZ offers. Loved the design of the course and will play here again for sure. Tip: Keep it straight! Target golf on this course, which I love.
4	What a great day!  The course was in excellent shape.  A bit of a hike even with a cart.  They had 90* rule in effect and the green seemed to always be in a valley.   Tough track but playable.  It should be on your playlist
4	The view was phenomenal & the really dirty Martinis were flowing! A great, local kick back place to enjoy the sunset!!
