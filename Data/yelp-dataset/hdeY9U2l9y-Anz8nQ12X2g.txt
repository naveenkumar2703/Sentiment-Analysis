4	Interesting that this show opened on May 12 and no one had added it to Yelp before now. Oh I know why. Because it's at the Riviera - a casino that always seems like a ghost town.My friend had free tickets through one of the many seat filler type sites that keep popping up left and right. So with the caveat that I saw it for free, I must say that I rather enjoyed it. I think something can be said for these small shows that have an intimate theater setting. Being so close to the stage and with such a small audience size, you just feel more connected to the performers.Make no mistake. There is nothing new here. You've seen all of these types of acts somewhere before. But that doesn't take away from their entertainment value. It's only a small on-stage cast of about nine people. By the end of the show, I really felt an appreciation for what they just put on display. At barely over one hour, I think it's just the right length too.Oh I have to mention this. I swear that one of the male performers reminds me of like an Asian David Bowie. I'm thinking it's the makeup.
3	The Riviera is as janky as a casino gets on the Strip. Fortunately this show wasn't as bad as the casino downstairs. The performers were all talented and there was even a funny guy who did really idiotic things to throw in some humor. The problem for me was the performances themselves, especially the girls who spin round mats on their feet and hands. It was so unexciting to watch. I was rooting for one of them to drop something to at least get a gasp from the audience. The worst part was the blatant memorabilia pitch at the end. Those Asian kids really tried a hard sale. It was annoying and we practically had to push our way past them on the way out.
4	I think it would be considered more of a kids show, so i would recommend it if you have kids. It was nice being on the front row and seeing everything up close. The performances were neat, and we enjoyed it.
