4	My family, and I have made this a frequent Sunday stop. While the bakery itself isn't much, and is usually a bit on the messy side... they do have some yummy stuff! My favorite is the cinnamon sugar bun. It isn't drowning in frosting... so it's right up my alley. My kids do prefer the standard cinnamon rolls loaded with frosting.I have had their pecan sticky roll, and it is very tasty as well.You can't go wrong here!
1	Called from out of state because I found them on Yelp.  Wanted to send a local family a nice Easter package of baked goodies.  Woman who answered the phone was completely unhelpful and condescending... I just don't understand at all what the deal was.I'm not sure why they wouldn't want me to spend money in their shop.
1	Went out of our way to visit this place.  The lady who greeted us was not very friendly or welcoming.  She seemed offended that I wouldn't buy bread because they do not make anything with whole wheat flour.  We bought a sticky bun anyway just because we didn't want to walk out without purchasing anything.  Then she made me feel stupid for asking for a healthy bread while buying a sweet treat.  She should know that bread is eaten more often than an occasional pastry...The bun was good but the ones at the Good Egg are delicious too...I will not be going there again.
5	Love this place as a special weekend morning treat. My 6 year old would go there every weekend and the owner is always super nice to us.  Always pick something up when guests are in town.  The sticky buns, cinn rolls are a must.  The salty sweet combo is perfect.  Loaf of white bread is great too!  Go try it.  You'll be glad you did!
