1	After waiting 2 hours for delivery the driver dropped off the wrong order.  Tried calling and i got hung up on.  Drove down there and demanded a refund.  I was told the credit card machine was down.  We will see if I get a refund.
1	This location doesn't honor internet coupons. They are very "No can do" oriented..They don't budget on anything. They always make a mistake. They have no idea what customer service even is. Bad management!
2	I really like Hungry Howies Pizza so I continue to buy food from there.  Here's the catch.  Don't use the internet because they won't even pay attention to the order (I know this because it happened to me) and don't deliver because it will take at least and hour and a half (twice happened to me). So basically order over the phone and go and pick it up.
3	Love the hot sandwiches and cheese bread. The pizza not so much. Service at this place could be better.
1	This location is unprofessional, I waited over 2 hours for my delivery and when I was promised a free pizza, my name and information was suddenly not in their "system". The manager was unaccommodating, I was in the hospital and tried to order a pizza for my husband to pick up and she said I had to come in to pick it up after I told her that I was in the HOSPITAL.
1	Very unprofessional. I have had delivery from this location in the past, and now suddenly they won't deliver. Very upsetting considering that they have never had issues delivering to is before. Ended up getting dominoes with No problems at all. Supervisor wouldn't let me speak with anger to voice my concern.
4	Good service,  pizza is always made how we ordered it, been going here for years and never had a terrible experience
