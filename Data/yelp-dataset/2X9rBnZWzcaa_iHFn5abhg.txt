1	They definitely got the Terrible part right !This place totally sucks!Pros:*  they had a copy of Las Vegas Weekly for me to pick up* Well lit... even in the evening*  Perfect gas station to go to if you have lots of time to kill, you strictly only use cash, and enjoy standing in lines!Cons:* Their card reader did not read my card... go figure! * You have to go inside if you want a copy of your receipt.* Service sucks too... surprised?  I didn't think so.Final Verdict:  Go elsewhere.  I only went here because I was going to run out of gas and I had no choice.  I've been here before and I am honestly not surprised of m disappointments.  Numerous times that I've been here, I have had to go inside to pay for the gas because their card reader was malfunctioning.  They always tell me that their computers are down (whatever that means) because the computers and registers inside were all operating correctly.  Then to have to go back inside to get your receipt?  Forget it.  I didn't want to wait in line with a bunch of other customer who were inconvenienced because their credit cards failed to register upon their swipe.  Avoid this place.  They totally DO NOT upkeep this place.  Beware !!
2	As far as gas stations and quick-stop stores go, I really don't have a lot of things I look for: I want to be able to pay for my gas on the quick, and maybe grab a soda or beef jerky if I'm feeling like that. When I stopped here, the card reader didn't work the first time, so I had to try it again. And again. And again. Then it worked. It was frustrating, but I was glad it finally worked. When I went in to get a Gatorade, I had to wait in a forever line. It sucked, but I was way thirsty. Really, it's hard for a gas station to fail. All you need is quick gas and ok service. I'm going to give this place two stars only because it's at or below the standard of service.
