4	I came across this small and cute boutique and found this place to carry trendy and cute clothes, shiny accessories and eye-catching shoes for reasonable prices. You can find really nice cardigans, sweaters, shorts, pretty dresses, shoes, jewellery, tops, jackets etc.The staff is really nice, the store is neat and tidy and they have plenty of items to choose from. I will definitely shop here again.The only downfall is that when this place gets one too many persons, it can be hard to browse.
