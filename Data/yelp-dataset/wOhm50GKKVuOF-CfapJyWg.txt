4	Good local car repair with excellent staff.  Bud - the longtime owner and his wife are usually on site.  They've done work on my custom jeep as well as my old suburban and have always done an excellent job at a fair price.  And they stand behind their work!
1	Bud and his crew made one too many mistakes on my little SUV and would not warrant the work they did.  It ended up costing me $300 for a tow from 100 miles away.  Bud's crew told me to "have it towed back and they'd take care of me".  They fixed the problem...something they didnt do right in the first place...but would not help me with the cost of the tow.  They also did work on my clutch and it chatters horribly.  I will have another company look at it.  Not Bud's.  Steer clear.
5	I love Bud's. For years they worked on my old '60 Galaxie when most other shops in town either didn't want to or didn't know how to do the work. These guys are real mechanics, not just a collection of 20 yr olds who only know how to plug your car into a computer to diagnose the problem. And most importantly, they don't run up the bill for extra time or unnecessary parts. My buddy just received a quote for a job of $175 from bud's that another shop wanted to charge $800 for! Bottom line: to me, auto shops are all about finding someone fair you can trust. For me, it's these guys.
