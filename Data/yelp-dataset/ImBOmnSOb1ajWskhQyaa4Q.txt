3	I had an iPod dock put into my SUV. Everyone was nice whenI called to make the appointment and all my questions were answered. My problem came with having to return 2xs for them to get everything right. The first return we made was because the radio wasn't working AT ALL. My dashboard was put back together incorrectly (an oversight to the person who picked it up for me- he's unfamiliar with my car) so now I have to go back again. I wish I could give a better review, but the inconvenience of having to make so many trips back soured the whole experience. The guys that helped me were super super nice to deal with. They apologized both return trips.
5	I went in to get my Viper remote replaced because my other two stopped working and instead of just selling me a new one right away the owner tried to see if it was battery or something else. I like the honesty of that and he was very friendly and fast and replacing the remote and re-programming it to my car. I highly recommend this place!
2	Kind of makes me feel like I' inconveniencing them.  I get left so they can help others.  I don't mind waiting, but when its my turn, then I am the person that should get the help and the other people should be told to wait.
5	Had a remote start/security system installed there on my G5 and then got a new car and they swapped it to my new car for cheap. Very friendly and awesome people. Would recommend this place to people.
