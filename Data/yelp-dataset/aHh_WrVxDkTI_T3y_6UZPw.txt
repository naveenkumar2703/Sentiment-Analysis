5	I had a girls weekend getaway and thought 3 dozen Oh Katie! Cookies would be enough for my friends and I. Boy was I wrong,  they were gone within the first couple of hours!! Thank you for your amazing cookies!
5	They are simply amazing! Gave to my daughter's teachers and therapists for Teacher Appreciation Day and they couldn't stop raving about them. Found my husband hiding while eating his, so he wouldn't have to share! Worth every penny!
