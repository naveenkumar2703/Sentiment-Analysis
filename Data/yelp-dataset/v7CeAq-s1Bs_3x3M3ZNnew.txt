2	2 stars are the the insane prices. Also a review for the location on the casino floor. The customer service is outstanding. But for a daily cigar smoker; your normal smoke will be 5 times as much. But you can find a smoke if you know what your doing.
5	Yes, the prices are about 2x the normal cost of a Davidoff and Davidoff's are the most expensive volume cigars, so people used to smoking $5 cigars are going to choke here. I came here in September 2013 and hadn't smoked in many years. After having a fun night I decided I wanted to fire up a good cigar and asked the salesperson to help me find one. Despite being a complete newbie he treated me like I knew what I was doing and with great respect. When I asked questions he was extremely helpful and he asked questions to help me pinpoint exactly the perfect cigar.Yes, I paid $37 for a $19 Davidoff Millennium Robusto (tubo adds 50 cents), but to this day I haven't smoked a finer cigar and I've been trying to find it by smoking the best of Arturo Fuente's, Padro, Montecristo,  La Flor Dominicana, Romeo y Julietta and more. This guy nailed it and $700 worth of cigars later, I still haven't topped his recommendation.After the purchase he cut and toasted the cigar for me to perfection and was super helpful. This was like purchasing something at a Rolex or Burberry store where the service after the sale is brilliant!I highly recommend this place - just remember that you are on vacation and this is about having fun. You'll pay 4x the cost of a typical bottle of wine at a restaurant so what's the crime in paying 2x for a premium cigar?
