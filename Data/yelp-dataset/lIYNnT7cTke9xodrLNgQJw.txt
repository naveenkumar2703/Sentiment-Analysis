3	It's a supermarket chain, so don't expect great produce, 'cause their fruits and vegetables are pretty much mediocre across the board.  That said, it's a supermarket, so it has pretty much all the general foods you might want.  And they do put out some pretty good manager's specials from time to time.
3	This grocery store is adequate enough and I don't have any complaints.  It has a well-stocked selection of packaged foods and decent quality produce.  I wish the fruits and vegetables were fresher or tastier, but I'll take what I can get from my neighborhood grocery chain (and hey, Trader Joe's is just up the road).One very nice thing about this particular store are the employees.  They are more helpful than most and offer solid customer service.
3	Never had any problems at this Smith's. It is what it is and I don't expect much going into any chain market. Their produce selection is meh, ok and everything else is standard. I've pretty much always visited on a weekend after draining my wallet, I mean, shopping at Whole Foods up the street and it's never been ridiculously busy which is nice. All of the staff I've encountered have been friendly and helpful and the place is always well stocked.Nothing stands out, good or bad, always a decent experience.
3	This is far from the nicest Smith's in town but it's solidly A-Ok! The store is well stocked and the employees can usually get you in and out quickly. What more do you really require in a standard chain grocery store? Make sure to take note: they don't have a gas station at this location.
