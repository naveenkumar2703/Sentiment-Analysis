3	This is a nice wee addition to the Royal Mile, means I don't have to always go to Starbucks to get some free wifi.The coffee is of a better quality than you would get in the rival establishment down the road, cakes tend to be better too. Service was really good, he was friendly and happy to help me out to sort the wifi. The main issue with this branch is it is TINY. I kid you not less than 10 tables?! So keep that in mind if you are planning on staying a while!
4	We found Cafe Nero on the walk from our Royal Mile hotel to Edinburgh Castle. We had decided to skip a formal breakfast and allow more time to tour the castle, and Cafe Nero was a happy medium. I got a Cafe Mocha to perk and warm me up, as well as a Raspberry and White Chocolate Muffin. The coffee was perfect and chocolatey. My muffin had some nice crunchy streusel on top. It wasn't too dense either. The tart raspberries and acidic white chocolate went together perfectly. This was a great spot for a quick walking breakfast.
