5	I graduated from sca in 99 & now my children attend the school.  I absolutely love the elementary staff.  What a joy to watch my children learning the bible and applying it to real life.  I don't have to worry about what world view the teacher is trying to teach my kids.
1	Unfortunately we are neighbors of this school.  When we moved in we honestly could not have anticipated how completely unconcerned with their community they could be.  There have been so many issues with the loud speakers.  We expected the noise for games and were ok with that.  But there have been cases of high school kids out on the field with no staff supervision plugging in their iPhones and blaring music and just hanging out with friends.  Right now we are going on the 5th hour of blaring music with no game going on.  And the school is on spring break so there is no one to even talk too.  It is completely unacceptable the way they treat the people who live around them.  Oh and on the education bit... the high school cheerleader were selling pom poms to raise money so we thought we would buy a couple.  They were each three dollars.  They tried to give me the wrong change three times before I had to tell them what the change should be!
