3	One of the biggest in the city this optical express seems to cover everything from shades, to contact lenses and specs.  I don't wear glasses and haven't used their surgery service my flatmate gets her contacts from here and says the service is good and she rarely has to wait. I went in with her one day and the prices seemed reasonable enough. I had fun with the crazy colour contacts but wouldn't really pay that amount for cat eye contacts- would head to party dress-up shops instead.
5	*warning - there are some really bad jokes and puns in this review about eyes*I dropped in here after spying their 'drop in for a free eye test today!' sign outside. I was pleasantly surprEYEsied to see that I could be taken right there and then! I was in a bit of a fuffle though, my hair was messy and I hadn't looked in the mirror since the morning so goodness knows what  I looked like. But in I went, got my  test and they took my glasses to change the lenses there and then! Brilliant!What's more, they had them ready by 5pm! I only went in at 3.30! I also met a girl I went to school with working behind the till, so that was nice! I also sensed some serious flirtation going on between the guy behind the till and me. teehee.
4	I got my first pair of glasses at Optical Express which came with a significant discount due to my student status.I was kept waiting quite a while and I remember I was a little annoyed to start with, but everything else went pretty smoothly. The choice of frames is dizzying and I probably spent an hour agonizing over "full frame, or half?".They're very efficient and I was able to pop back in to pick my glasses up two days later, together with complementary case.The store has now moved from Princes Street to George Street!
