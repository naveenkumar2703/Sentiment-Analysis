4	When it comes to a quality lingerie shopping experience this is the place to go. The owner Brandy is there often and is more than accomodating to her customer's needs. If you've never had a proper bra fitting they are more than willing to help and are super helpful. Discreet and professional they will help you find just what you're looking for. Great thing about this place is that they not only have stuff for small women they also have stuff in bigger sizes, I believe their bras go all the way up to a size J! This is a family run mom and pop type shop so it's great since you can support a local small business :)
5	This place was very helpful friendly and so much variety for a smaller shop. And has super prices!
5	I love this store!  I stop in whenever I'm out in about or if I'm looking for something specific.  The owner and her daughter in law are great people and I always feel like they cater to me.  The store is intimate and I always feel comfortable with the girls helping me out.  The prices are the best I've seen in Las Vegas and the quality is amazing.  I love all their specials, grab backs, holiday sales and they have an excellent REWARDS PROGRAM.  I bring family and visitors in every chance I get.  They carry a variety of items and there is always someone for everyone.
