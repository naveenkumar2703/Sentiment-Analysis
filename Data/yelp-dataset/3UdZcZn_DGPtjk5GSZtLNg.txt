4	Great little out of the way Italian restaurant across from the Palm's hotel.  Nothing flashy, just good food.  If you go, try the Oso Buco and don't forget to try the marrow!
5	I don't know why my review said this was closed or mentioned Chef Marc. This place is open, has nothing to do with Chef Marc, and the food is fabulous even if the place is a bit low on atmosphere.I love this place. The food is consistently wonderful. Even their plain tomato sauce is the bomb! Rene, the waiter, is wonderful though sometimes a bit overwhelmed as he seems to often be a bit understaffed.Their starter salad is perfect, zingy, and the dressing tries to compel me to lick the bottom of the bowl.The garlic bread is serviceable, but it's free and plentiful and I can't complain even if it is a little dry. Besides, I can use it to "lick up" the salad dressing for me!If they have a fish special, I usually go for it. Even fish haters would love their fish preparations.Lunch is a delicious bargain. Dinner brings more options at a moderate price.Nothing fancy but if you love great Italian food, you will love Pasta Mia!
5	The secret of Las Vegas.Excellent food and service.We make this a must stop on every trip to Vegas for at least the past 10 years.Our last visit was in October,2007, with a wedding rehearsal party of 20 people.We're in Vegas this coming week and guarantee you 'll find us there for dinner.
4	hit pasta mia for lunch today - solo ( SO taking a nap ) - it's been a very long time since i hit this place, i just mentioned the place relating to another review and i thought, geez, haven't been to mia in awhile so what the heck...for $10.95 had chicken parmigiana that came with garlic bread ( very, very good ) soup or salad  - went with the salad ( very fresh, nice italian dressing ) and a side of pasta...decent sized chicken - had the cheese slice and sauce on top...the sauce was ok...i prefer a sauce  with more herbs ...mainly oregano. ...same for the pasta sauce, a little too light for mesoda - 1.50...not sure if refills were included since no one asked me  if i wanted one....it's interesting that when they brought  my entree, they brought me a glass of water...almost like a hint - drink water, not soda....also, they give me a loaf of garlic bread ...there is an emphasis on the menu that the table only gets one loaf...geez...i ate 2 pieces leaving about 6 pieces or so in the basket...can't they just give a few slices at a time for a person is dining solo or is it a loaf whether you have one person at the table or 10 people....overall, decent meal, decent price
1	I had this last night and i cannot say the i enjoyed it at all. I ordered fettuccine alfredo with chicken. It was more like the creamiest, cheesiest, thickest, largest, bowl of soup with some noodles in it topped off with some breaded fried strips of chicken. If i wanted to have a heartattack I would eat something a lot better. My boyfriend ordered linguine with mussels with WHITE sauce, and of course it came out with marinara, when he told the server he just said, "you HAVE to request white sauce," WHICH he did. On top of that they randomly tell you that you can't share, even though it says that nowhere on the menu. They give you very large portions which you very well could share and are pricey but be warned, NO SHARING.
4	Delicious!! I came here with a group of friends for a little carb loading dinner the night before the Rock & Roll Half Marathon. Service was excellent, food was excellent and the salad dressing was everything I expected it to be! I really wanted the Gnocchi, however the only Gnocchi dish they had on the menu was in a white sauce. I'm not a big fan of white sauces, they are usually delicious, but are WAY too rich for me. I asked if they could make me Gnocchi with Vodka sauce and without hesitation my request was granted. The Gnocchi was absolutely melt in your mouth amazing. Obviously home made, it had so much flavor and was exactly what I was craving. The portion size was perfect. Even had lots of sauce left over to soak up with my bread!
5	This place was wonderful compared to the Ventian hotel pasta. The prices were cheap, and big portion of food. The bread was so yummy as well! I will come here again!
4	This place was a hidden Italian gem! My Uncle and Aunt who live in Las Vegas took me here. It is very close to the Palms and has been visited by many celebrities. Must I say, the food is delicious! The restaurant is very well hidden and the looks of the place does not match the food! We ordered Calamari and Chicken Marsala (the best dish ever!)..With those dishes it came with a side of pasta, garlic bread and salad! I was sooo  full I didn't eat anything else that day! Everything here is excellent. At the end we also had Tiramisu also delicious. Our server was very funny and entertained us for the night. If you are looking for somewhere to eat off the strip, this would be a great choice! I will dine here again if I have the chance.
4	Excellent professional service. Establishment was clean.I ordered the chicken parmigiana, it was so tender i could easily cut it with my fork. Entrees come with delicious garlic bread and choice of soup or salad both equally delicious, and they leave fresh grated parmigiana cheese on the table. Dinner portions are huge, well worth the moderate price.
5	My parents and I have been coming to this place for a few years.  This is their favorite Italian place by far (they hardly eat anything besides Asian foods).  The location is in this plaza across from the Palms Casino on Arville.  Whenever we are there, it gets a stream of patrons, but never really busy (which is good for locals).  The only time I've seen it busy was this past Mother's day, but what establishment wasn't busy?        Here are some of the food highlights of our visits:*hot garlic bread with parmesan -  very addicting, we always get more parmesan and layer in on everything *house salad- romaine and red leaf lettuce w tomatoes and onions w/homemade Italian vinaigrette dressing*fried calamari -  perfectly done, comes with a side marinara sauce *Osso buco- very tender and comes with a small fork to scoop up the bone marrow; side of pasta included*seafood portifino-  tasty marinara sauce with clams, mussells, shrimp, and squid.       I've tried a few other dishes , but this is our usual. Same great quality and taste each time.   We always walk out with a full belly and our need to nap .
5	Fantastic! Thanks to YELP, we were able to find a well kept secret in Las Vegas! One would never drive by this place and say "Oh look...Italian food" It is in a dumpy looking strip mall! You MUST try this place! Better than any of the high priced tourist traps that everyone finds on the strip! The service is incredible as is the food and menu selections. The wine list is good too. When in Vegas you must find this place as it will be the best meal you will have on your trip!
3	Pasta Mia is a recurring lunch destination for me, as I work minutes away from it.  My coworkers love the place; I'm still not sure why!  The two Italian restaurants frequented by us are Pasta Mia and Nora's.  Nora's is always my first choice, but I seem to be the only one with that mindset.One thing I will say is that Pasta Mia is consistent.  But for me, that means consistently average.  Sauces are runny and don't stick to pasta; garlic bread is crunchy in an unpleasant way; getting your check can be the slowest part of the meal; servers are good about keeping on top of things; there are plenty of daily specials to keep things intereste; etc.  Yes, that was a list of both positive and negative things I experience, but it should be noted that I experience these things on a regular basis.Nothing has wowed me, or even satisfied me, enough for me to wake up one day and say to myself, "Self, you need to eat at Pasta Mia today."  You're not doing yourself a disservice if you eat here, but you can be doing yourself a favor if you decide to go down the street to Nora's.  Does that make sense?  I'd say it makes sense to me, but I'm kinda tired right now and I'm leaving that question in my review :)
5	We asked the concierge of our hotel where a really good local Italian (read: not super-touristy) place was, and she told us to go here, so gold star to lady at the Rumor Hotel with really bad highlights.  Anyway, it definitely is a local place: think strip mall instead of The Strip.  Parking was easy, and it's tucked away at the back.We ended up being the only people there (it was 4pm) and received excellent service.  I had the tilapia, and it was honestly the best tilapia I've ever had. It was super fresh and the veggies on the side were great. It came with an amazing salad with marinated tomatoes that didn't even need the dressing. AND I got a small side dish of pasta.  I'll be sweating garlic for the next few days, but I'm ok with that. I'm pretty sure this place is a front for the mob, but that just made it mobthentically good.  The owner or head chef dude or whatever talked like Joe Pesci, so that was cool.  I'm not going to get into many more specifics, but it was like being in the movie Casino except with less murder and less of a plotline and more pasta. Mmm, pasta.Get the tilapia, like, seriously.  Amazing.
5	Yes, yes and yes. This has to be the most Delicious Italian food I have eaten, even better than Mrs. Busamonte who lived next door to us as kids, she was from Sicily and no one has ever been able to touch her in the cooking of authentic Italian Food, but now that I have relocated to the west coast and Mrs. Bustamonte has passed on (I bet she is cooking for the man upstairs) this place is the best, the stuffed artichokes are to die for and the lasagna will have your eyes rolling so hard it will give you brain damage.  THIS IS THE BEST ITALIAN FOOD IN VEGAS BAR NONE!
2	I really wanted to like you Pasta Mia since you were recommended to me by fellow yelpers, but you made it so that I will not be returning.  A couple of my girls were coming from Reno for a bachelorette party and I wanted to eat at a place close to the Palms since we were going there afterwards. It took about 25 minutes for the server to come and even take our order. Since we are all girls and we were going to party afterwards we wanted to share our meals. The server said that they would charge us an extra 14.95 just to split our meals for each person that we were splitting with. REALLY!? I think it was just for us to spend more money, so we all ended up getting an entree which was ridiculous. All of us wasn't even close to being finished with our entree by the time we were full. The service was so slow for not even being that busy...it was 9.30 at night before we even got our food. One of my friends was so upset that she wanted to leave before the food even came out. I was so disappointed that it made me sad that I let my friends down from out of town. The food was very delicious, but the service that came along with it makes me not want to return here ever. SIGH! Hopefully everyone else will have a better experience than 5 of us pretty hungry gals.
3	Great food...once we got it.  Saturday night, 7pm reservation.  There wasn't a table for 6 in the front room so we were asked if we were OK with going to the back.  We weren't the only ones there and we said, "fine".  That may have been a mistake as we rarely saw our waiter.  The evening started with the waiter recommending a bottle of wine.  We said yes, not knowing the cost (should the waiter divulge the cost before accepting the order?)  The $60 a bottle didn't start things off very well.  The service dragged throughout the evening, and when we eventually received our food, every item was very good.  I don't mind taking my time with a good dinner with friends, but the staff should be on our time, not the reverse.  Five stars for the food, two for the service.
3	First of all, the food was excellent.  I had the scallops pasta dish.  The noodles were perfect, the sauce was tasty, and the scallops were nice and tender.  We had a nice salad, with roasted vegetables as appetizers.  The calamari was also good.  Overall, I cannot complain about the food.However, the service was horrific.  It took 30 minutes for our waiter to great us, over an hour to get our menus, and around 2 hours before our food arrived.  We spent a total of 3 hours in the restaurant due to the incredibly slow service.  The waiter apologized profusely, but didn't improve throughout the night.  He seemed incredibly flustered and unorganized.  I'm hoping this visit was an anomaly because the food really was good.  I would never go back, however, if I thought I'd get the same kind of service the next time around.  Too bad, this place could be really good.
4	This place is a total sleeper.  Looking for Real good Italian food? Forget that big fancy hotel on the strip.  Pasta Mia's food is better then anything you can get in that "fancy hotel" at half the price.  a definite "go to" spot.
5	I need to clarify a couple of things that have been previously posted about Pasta Mia.  First, when one eats/dines at a nicer restaurant than Denny's, service is usually slower to give the diner time to relax and enjoy the meal and the company they are with.  No one in a nice establishment is going to hurry you through your meal or constantly keep interrupting you with "Anything else?"  The busboy will keep watch and re-fill glasses of water without interrupting your table conversation.  Trust me, someone IS "paying attention" to your table, even though you may not be aware of it.Second, the food here is incredible and can hold it's own to any upscale, very pricey restaurant on the strip!  If you order Alfredo Sauce be sure you understand that "all" real Alfredo Sauce is a heart attack waiting to happen!  Just the same as a McDonald's Big Mac!We were looking for some Italian food yesterday and happened to pick Pasta Mia because we saw it from the road and it was close to the hotel.  What a fabulous surprise!  My husband had the linguine with white clam sauce and I had the angel hair pasta bologense (sp?) (meat) sauce, and a side of Italian sausage.  The food was the best Italian food we have ever eaten - and we have eaten plenty!  It even beat out my own Italian cooking (this is very hard for me to admit).If you have time for a leisurely meal and love good Italian food, then I would certainly give Pasta Mia a try and form your own opinion.  I am glad we did!
4	I've been three times and the food has been great.  Seems no one knows how good this place really is.  Great undiscovered Italian food for locals.
1	Absolutely DISGUSTING! Filthy chef / owner - Armando Martinez (not Italian by the way) could care less about the food you are going to put in your mouth or the service he provides - beware fellow foodies!
5	Hands down this was the BEST italian food that I have EVER had. Where do I begin? We were in town for our sons football game and our friend found this place online so we decided to try it. As soon as we walked in I knew it was going to be good because of all the awards and reviews they had hanging on the wall. We ordered several appetizers and salad first and were impressed..Then came the entree's,OMG,HEAVEN! We were a party of eight and everyone ordered something different. Lets just say our entire party was wowed by the food. Simply fresh,handmade from scratch and DELICIOUS! This will be a regular stop for me everytime I am in vegas..Only 8 minutes from the strip.
4	Great food large portions,and a fair price.
4	Food was amazing the salad was superb....I had the Penne alla Vodka with chicken it was to die for! And the eggplant omg yum-o the service was a little lacking the head server was nice but a little pushy and talked a lot....forgot my drink but it was nothing too bad I WILL be dining there again and I can't wait!
4	I have been coming to Pasta Mia since I was a kid when it was on E. Flamingo and usually places that have been around forever go downhill, Pasta Mia has gone uphill!First of all, the Rack of Lamb is better then anywhere else I have found in town.  Always perfectly cooked, the sauce is great, and the breadcrumbs give it a great texture.  The Salad and Bread is always good as well.  I wish this place was a little nicer inside, but has charm for being in an older shopping center and the service is classic italian style!  Give this place a try---if you are not a lamb person the Chicken Parm is great as well!
5	My wife and I went there for our anniversary last night.  I had the Chef's Special Chicken and she had the Chicken Angelo.  It was quite simply the best Italian food I have ever had.  The house salad dressing and garlic bread are nothing short of addictive.  The main courses were dazzling!  Even the penne pomodoro which is served as a side dish was spectacular.  My chicken had prosciutto and cheese with a demi glace that was sublime.  The chicken Angelo was over the top delicious. We have eaten here before, each time trying something different and each time leaving shaking our  head at how delicious the food was.The cynic in me wants nobody else to know about this place, so it stays our own special secret, but the foodie in me want to shout to the world how divine Past Mia West is.
5	Shrimp Scampi and the Chilean sea bass was where it was at. I used to go here with my mom and her boyfriend when I was younger and I had truly forgotten how good it was. They bring you free salad and garlic bread and the dressing is just amazing. I would buy bottles of it if the sold it but we got some to go anyway. The servers were amazing, it was quite, romantic, and as if time stood still. If you're looking for a great place away from the madness of the strip GO HERE! I even arranged for them to bring surprise cheesecake and it was romantic and amazing. You must try everything. My one regret was that we didn't bring 10 people and try so much more. We will return from LA when we visit.Can we get one of these in LA! Seriously awesome.
5	Everything was so delicious. It's a great alternative to hotel food.  Really easy to get there. The service was friendly. Definitely a keeper.
5	We got a suggestion from the concierge at the Tower Suites at Encore and boy, was she on track. This place was great!This place doesn't look like much from the outside -- it's in a strip mall, 3-4 miles from the Vegas Strip. You'll need a rental car or a taxi to get here. The decor isn't fancy. But when the effusive waiter greets you and offers you all sorts of suggestions on what to order, you know you've come somewhere pretty cool. We ordered an appetizer, salad, garlic bread, two entrees, and a dessert. Along with two glasses of house wine. The appetizer was fried mozzarella cheese. I thought it would be those frozen sticks -- but it was delicious fried triangles of cheese, covered in delicious marinera sauce. The salad and garlic bread were good -- pretty standard, with a great house balsamic vinaigrette. The entrees were outstanding. I had the chicken parmesan, which was tender, crispy, and delicious. The portion was too big, and it came with a side of penne pasta. The vodka sauce penne my boyfriend had was really delicious. Everything was obviously homemade. The dessert was homemade cheesecake, and it was good. Not mindblowing, but very tasty. The house wines were fine. For $6.95 a glass, a nice drinkable chianti is all I ask for. The service was good, but perhaps a slight bit understaffed. For a tip: They have a BUY ONE ENTREE GET ONE ENTREE 1/2 OFF coupon on their website. Using the aforementioned coupon, the bill (inclusive of everything) was $80. For Vegas, a great great deal. I'll definitely be back.
5	We had very attentive service and excellent meals. Our waiter did a great job explaining the specials.
5	Desperately craving really good Italian food, I tried Pasta Mia West after reading so many wonderful things about this restaurant's food. I could not have been more satisfied with my meal here!Their basic house salad is very fresh with a dressing that was so garlicky and good I almost wanted to drink it.I requested the shrimp scampi to be served with angel hair -- it is normally served here with vegetables and penne pasta on the side. The shrimp were large, plump, and succulent, and the sauce was incredible. I overate pretty badly -- it just couldn't be helped -- but ordered their homemade tiramisu for dessert anyway. It was very good; I enjoyed the hint of anise, and loved that it wasn't too sweet.The service was excellent and I look forward to returning to try many of their other dishes. I don't eat veal, but the way the diner at the next table was gushing about his osso bucco made me wish I could try it.The only drawback is the restaurant's atmosphere which is very dated and poorly lit. If they were to update the interior -- even with just red and white checked tablecloths and chianti bottle candles, and lose the tv screen -- that outstanding dining experience would be even more wonderful!
3	I really, really, really wish these guys would invest some money in their decor.  It's a real turn off.  The food is great but I sometimes pass by and go somewhere else because I don't like the way it looks inside.
5	AMAZING Italian food.  Good sauce in Vegas is hard to find, and this place is GREAT.
4	Pretty Yum!   We went on the recommendation of Yelpers and it was a truly delicious dinner experience.  The service was attentive and our meals were tasty.  Bonus = we didn't have to go inside a casino or hotel, so it was a quiet and intimate dinner, which is a nice respite from the crowded Strip.If you love Italian, you will really like Pasta Mia!
5	Delicious, authentic Italian!
3	Went to Pasta Mia for lunch as a recommendation from a co-worker and it was average.  Very average.  I ordered the chicken angelo which came with a nice salad and a bowl of penne with red sauce that was something similar to Hunts in a can.  The chicken angelo had nice sized artichokes which I loved, a few mushrooms and bits of chicken in a really bland and unexciting sauce.  I was less than impressed.  The garlic bread is soaked in butter, lightly herbed and nice n crispy -- if that's what you like. Another person ordered the lasagna and it looked amazing -- he also said it was awesome.  Another ordered the chicken parm and said it was "good, but not as good as . . . . ".  So overall, not horrible, but there are other, better, tastier choices if you truly want a good meal!
4	We ventured here before the Rock and Roll marathon...for a last carb binge for my boyfriend....apparently everyone else had that idea as well!  We went on Saturday night and the place was packed, waiters were hustling...some even run/jogging from one place to another.  Very friendly staff, but no designated host/hostess to seat people.  This is unfortunate since I saw many patrons become impatient...they ended up walking around the restaurant and asking the waiters if they could sit in the empty tables they saw.  We were seated after about a 5 minute wait...even though there were a few empty tables available.  The food took a longggg time to come out....BUT the food was delicious! I tried the penne alla vodka with pancetta and added grilled chicken.  The penne was cooked to a perfect al dente and the sauce was a myriad of delicious flavors.  I think I must have pushed my plate away and declared I was full at least 5 times, but the sauce drew me back tot he plate each time....The chicken is grilled and very tender and the portions are huge. I would definitely recommend this place to pasta lovers or anyone needing to carb load!
2	we generally had a good experience here, but a few things missed the mark.  first and foremost, service was excellent and friendly so no complaints there.  to start i had the pasta fagioli soup- not very tasty and pasta in it was way too soggy.  we also had a caprese salad for the table which was excellent so it made up for the subpar soup.  for dinner, i had the veal parmigiana which was actually really tasty and a HUGE portion.  this one missed the mark big time though- there was a whole pile of just fried breading covered in sauce and cheese and no meat in it. i noticed it as i was cutting into it, so i just put it to the side and ate only pieces of veal.  even the server came back and asked me if i had taken the breading off and i said, "no, it was just on the plate like that for some reason."  without this mistake, i wouldve really enjoyed the veal, but this was sort of a turn off.
3	Wide selection of specialty pasta.Came here a few days ago hoping to find a true diamond in the rough. Although it didn't meet my expectations, the dish was still enjoyable.I wanted to try something new so I ordered the gnocchi, which reminded me of dukbukgi without the spiciness. I liked the sauce but the pasta didn't flow well with me. The soup was very average. It actually tasted like it was straight out of a can; I took a couple sips and didn't touch it the rest of the night. I also had the fettuccine shrimp which I enjoyed better, but it wasn't the best. The mozzarella sticks were decent but I think the garlic bread alone will suffice. For a restaurant that has pasta in its name, I was a little disappointed.The decoration is modest but a little aged. I thought the dishes were a little pricy and the surroundings nor food does it justice.
5	We were in the area and wanted Italian food so we stopped in here.  Located in the corner of the shopping center the restaurant is fairly large on the inside and the smell upon walking in was very appetizing.  We were served with water and delicious garlic bread prior to ordering.   I ordered the chicken dello chef for $18.99 and my husband ordered the sole special for $23.95.  The salad is served family style at the table with their house dressing which was very tasty.   Our dinners arrived and we were very pleased with the portion sizes as well as the taste of both entrees.   The staff and service was wonderful as well.  We will be returning to Pasta Mia.
3	If you on a date or want that a little fancy  italian atmosphere , this is not the one you want to go to. Out dated ugly dining room. The dishes were decent, but nothing special about the place. There are so many other better choices out there.
4	This was a GREAT place for us to eat at. It had something for our whole family to enjoy. I had a basic tomato and basil angel hair pasta so I could share it with my daughter and my husband had one of their specials, lobster ravioli. Talk about RICH! It was SO GOOD!!! He gobbled it all up. I had enough left of mine to save for dinner the following night :)The salad with the house dressing was great and I had the soup which was also very tasty. My daughter loved it too. Garlic bread would have been better if the outside wasn't burnt, but overall we enjoyed the whole experience. The smell and warmth of the restaurant was welcome compared to the cold and windy outside weather and the staff was very friendly and we were seated right away, which was a bonus.This is somewhere I'd like to come and eat at again as there are so many things to choose from!
1	Thought I would give this place a shot,since its near my place of work....  the service was not good and the food a bit to be desired.I was looking at 2 dishes either the puttennesca or a chicken dish. So I asked the waiter what was better and also if the olives in the puttennesca were in fact black olives as stated on the menu or were they kalamata olives like so many dishes have.  Well the waiter said 'oh they are black olives because that's what the menu says, but I would go with the chicken dish.'i asked how the cappuccinos were and he said good.I wanted pasta so I opted for the puttennesca because it has black olives not kalamata olives. The dish came and the olives were kalamata olives!My advice, if you are a waiter learn the menu and don't just say get an item because it costs more so you get bigger tip.  Bad idea.Not going back and I'm glad I didn't get a cappuccino. Probably premade from a packet. I'll stick either my standby of Roma cafe on Spring Mountain.  Never a bad experience there.
4	My husband and I travel to Vegas once a year to see family, enjoy the sites and gorge on some really great food.  My mother-in-law heard about Pasta Mia, located across from the Palms Hotel, and wanted to check it out.  We were all game.  Man - was that a great decision.  There's a huge sign that states that a free bottle of house wine will be offered for parties of 4 or more.  Sweet!  And we were attended to by Liz and some of her colleages and they were attentive without being over bearing.  We didn't have appetizers to start because given that we were visiting, we all were expecting to eat our entire dinner portion (no where to take leftovers).  So I don't have any comments to share on the appetizers but the garlic bread was SO GOOD.  Again, so good.  Salad with the homemade dressing was a hit and I was the only one that opted for soup with my meal and that was nice and tasy as well.When the portions come out, you'll be blown away. Huge portions - definitely enough to share.  My husband had the chicken pesto fettucine, I had the chicken and mushroom pasta (yum) and I can't remember what everyone else had.  But everyone was happy as a clam at the end of the meal.  The sauces are very creamy and rich but extremely delicious.  Definitely not diet fare.For all that Vegas has to offer in terms of food and restaurant options, I feel like we found a gem located in a strip mall.  Will be dining there again for sure.
5	I have been going to this place for almost 20 years the Angel Hair Bolognese is to die for....   Don't forget to get a stuffed artichoke they are amazing.   The food is consistant and the staff is very friendly.. check it out you will like it.
1	Tried it again and I have to say it was very expensive and not worth the price. I ordered the Pasta Fagoli with a side of Spinach with Garlic. the Pasta Fagoli was terrible, watered down, salty, pasta falling apart from sitting so long. Spinach with Garlic and Olive Oil was super salty with burnt spinach and garlic. My man ordered a chicken dish and he like half a piece of chicken.
5	Always wonderful and grand.  Artichoke appetizer is awesomeness and so is the orange roughy is so good!
3	Ordered pasta bollengese and fried mozzarella for pick up. Food was good but I think it would have been better had I eaten it there. The togo boxes they use here r the styrofoam with the flip up lid that dont really seal so they saran wrap the containers and the heat from the food builds up condensation and waters down ur sauce. If u order to go ask for sauce on the side or be prepared for a bit of a mess. Pasta was flavorfull but a bit watered down but I think its because of the wrap job. Fried mozzarella was swimming in the sauce so it was a bit soggy when I finally got to eat it.  I will definetly try the food again but will instead sit down there for dinner. A nice wine might just compliment the meal perfectly and the restaurant looked very nice on the inside.
4	I am surprised for how good the food is that this place is never busy. I have been several times and really love the service and food. The salad is really good, the house dressing is creamy and delicious. I love the Osso Bucco, I really have never had better anywhere! I am giving them 4 and not 5 stars because of the spaghetti w/ marinara. The pasta was over cooked, and I prefer their bolognese sauce to their marinara.  Still... Osso Bucco... gotta try it!
4	Went at lunch after reading all the reviews -- it was totally dead and the decor leaves something to be desired .. But the food was pretty good
4	I have to say seriously the best chicken Parmesan there is in town. Possibly that I've ever had. There is fans of heavy gravy and a lighter gravy which this is but I'm telling you. Amazing and it's always on point. Sadly I have never in 20 years of eating here ate any thing else. It's that good. The decor like others have said is a little dated and the ambiance is not of the major players in town for restaurants but the food and prices are great. Always can get in. Same wait staff since I started and great affordable lunch specials. I'm totally fine with spending every dollar they make on the food and quality ... Not the decor. Go eat there.
1	I have changed my review from a 5 star to a 1 star after going here for many of years.  We recently came in and have had the same order for many of years.  When we got the bill there were two sodas instead of 1.  We told the waiter assuming it was an error.  The owner came out and accused us of having two drinks.  Due to their no refill on the bill i order a diet coke and a glass of ice.  She said two glasses charge for two drinks.    I was surprised and On the way out went again to explain that this was not the case. She then informed me we'll you are not allowed to split a meal?  I said we have come here and had the same order 13.00 lunch, and that my husband was 65 we just don't eat as much as we use to.   She said we'll that just it's allowed.  I explained this was the first I had been told this.  She said she had been catching the employees doing this and was putting a stop to it.  That we had to order a side salad or something.  I was really embarrassed.  It isn't the money my husbands doctor wants him to drink water and if we would have been told we had to order a side salad we would of or charge us a second plate charge we don't care but wow this is such an awful way to embarrass a customer in front of everyone and make the rest of their day ruined.
4	Excellent "local" restaurant off the strip.  This family owned restaurant has tasty specials, generally good food and good service.  The salad was crisp, the food was good and the garlic bread was delicious
1	This is the most AWFUL Italian food I have EVER eaten! I took my fiance' here for his birthday and what a mistake that was. Everything we ordered had way too much garlic, including the house salad dressing which was almost inedible. He ordered the chicken marsala-the sauce was thin and runny and tasted like they literally poured maple syrup on top! It tasted unlike any Marsala we've ever tried, and NOT in a good way. The side of pasta we both had was dry and the red sauce was extremely bland. I didn't know you could ruin Italian food this bad. The service was acceptable, but not what you would expect at a fine dining restaurant. The restaurant was also lacking atmosphere. We normally love Italian food and love trying new restaurants, but we definitely won't be returning. If you want a 1 star dining experience with 5 star prices, this is the place for you.
5	I have been eating here for over 15 years now and the quality of the food and the staff has not changed in all this time.  The wait staff is very friendly and work well together.  The portions are large and always cooked well.   In the last 15 years Pasta Mia has become the place where we come for family celebration dinners.  They have been there for over 40 years and I don't see them going anywhere soon.  Thanks for all the good times.
5	How do you start off a review when you are still in a happy food coma? Well let me try. First off, I have never been a fan of Italian food. In fact I avoid it in most situations but my husband loves Italian food and once in a while I give in to make him happy. This was one of those very few times. The food here really is top notch. It is so fresh and made from scratch. The calamari with marinara sauce was THE BEST I have every tasted, the linguini with scallops was cooked to perfection, the flavor was out of this world delicious and the chicken parmigiana just melts in your mouth it's so tender and delectable. Oh and don't forget to try the spumoni...mmmm. I just cannot seem to get enough of Pasta Mia!
4	I dined here a couple years ago and happy to know that the quality has not skipped a beat over time.  The atmosphere inside is elegant and gives the feel of an old school Italian restaurant without the cheesiness of some of the restaurants in town that try to be too old Italian family or mobsterish.  The service was excellent.  We were promptly seated and our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu.  The waitress made some excellent recommendations.  The service was very old school, professional and refined.I had the Portofino with an assortment of seafood and red sauce.  This dish was delicious.  The portioning of the seafood was a pleasant surprise.  My wife had the fettucini with shrimp, mushroom and pink sauce (a mix of red and white).  This dish was amazing and the sauce really made the dish.A lot of restaurants in Las Vegas claim to have great Italian food and don't deliver.  Italian food is a tough market for Las Vegas restaurants to set themselves apart.  Your mom's New Jersey kitchen Italian food is not as great as you remember and doesn't hold a candle to Italy.  At that end of the day anything our mom made is an imitation of an imitation of what was made in the home country.  This restaurant is the closest thing to the quality and attention to detail I've had in Italy.
4	To start the garlic bread was alright nothing super impressive. Had the fried calamari for an appetizer, it was good but I've definitely had better. Same with the salad. Nothing too fancy. As far as main course goes I had fettuccine and my girlfriend got the muscle and clam linguine. The sauce for the Alfredo was good. And the muscle and clams were good also. Overall a nice little spot for lunch it does get a little pricey for dinner.
3	I had the spaghetti with meat sauce simple choice but overall I liked it, if your not a fan of to much sauce be sure to let them know because it comes with tons piled on I however love my spaghetti that way so it was great. This still doesn't beat my favorite meat sauce which is at Roma deli but this is definitely a close number 2 everything was great had a nice salad the dressing, plenty cheese on the side and garlic bread was great. Definitely will come back again and try different things off the menu I saw a couple of things that might make this my number one choice and I need to still try the deserts I was so full from how much they gave me which may I add was great that I didn't have room but the specials and wines as well as service makes this place great, will be back for sure.
4	I've been coming her a long time for a hearty comfort meal of great garlic bread, chicken parmesan, and pasta. Usually I get the salad which comes with the main course, but this time I opted for the pasta/bean soup. Next time I will go back to the salad as I thought the soup should have had more beans. The main three items, though, never disappoint and unless I am super hungry, even the lunch portion causes me to take some home with me. On this last occasion I arrived for a 1pm lunch meeting with two others. Most of the lunch crowd had cleared out and the waiters were setting up for the dinner hour. It was annoying that on this occasion I had to put some effort into getting the waiter's attention for a water refill. Otherwise, the service was friendly and efficient. Of course, I will be back.
5	I can't believe it took me this long to try this place. I have been missing out for years! The food is INCREDIBLE. My boyfriend and I were blown away at the quality and taste. From the salad dressing to the main courses we LOVED it. We came here from a Groupon but we plan on being regulars from that day forward. The chef is not only talented, he is THERE on property actually cooking. Maybe he can teach a thing or two to some of these "celebrity" chefs who have their name on various places and cuisines  they aren't even in the vicinity in. PROS: -Pollo Dello Chef - Chicken Breast, Eggplant, Prosciutto Ham and Mozzarella Cheese Covered   Lightly with Demi Glaze Sauce.-Linguine Fresh Clams- Talented Chef-Fresh salad included with our dinnerCONS:No room for dessert
3	There are two things that are hard to find in Las Vegas. Authentic and good Chinese and Italian Food. I'm not the only one that says that. I have an acquittance from Italy, and know many native Chinese people who live in Las Vegas, who say the same. Pasta Mia is NOT New York or San Francisco quality, but it is decent for Las Vegas.My first suggestion is to get there early or make reservations. It fills up fast. They bring you out a loaf of house garlic bread, and it is excellent. They charge about $3 for a second loaf, but it is well worth it. The service is good, and they do seem to have a good selection of wines. The pasta and sauces are acceptable, but not worth "singing" over. This is a good place to take the family when you are craving pasta. If you are trying to impress someone with your knowledge of Italian food, go on line and see when Southwest has a sale to San Francisco, or Jet Blue is going to New York.  You just can't get great Italian food in Las Vegas.
3	Meh. The food here is okay. This is your average and typical Italian place.
5	It's rare that you go to  out to eat with a group and everyone loved what they ordered. The clams were fresh, the shrimp were huge and even the simple spaghetti and meatballs was ta die for. I highly recommend this place.
1	I wish I had read one of the previous reviews about the owner....Until we received the bill, I thought the place was alright. I had forgiven the fact that the waiter spilled water all over my friend's wife's hands .. Twice.The chicken parm and gnocchi was pretty delicious, I must say. I tried my friend'a chicken marsala and it, besides the carrots and broccoli that came with it, was pretty lousy.Things turned very sour when we got the bill. My buddies Marsala and my parm each included a side of spaghetti. He asked if there was an upcharge to switch to angel hair. They said no we can substitute it. I ordered next and didn't ask about an upcharge, but asked if I could swap for gnocchi. The guy said sure. My friends wife changed her spaghetti, to one with a meat sauce. Again, no mention of an additional costs.When the bill came, there was an $8 charge for meat sauce and $9 for gnocchi. The server played dumb with us so we asked for the manager... I calmly explained that wanted substitutions and had no intentions of paying for an upgrade. We were never made aware that we would be spending an additional $17 (the price of one full dinner) on substitutions. I also explained that any server I've ever encountered told us when additional fees apply to substitutions and ask if it's okay....Her response?"Well, did you eat it already?"I couldn't believe it. I've never met such an arrogant manager who didn't hear us out. We had already spent $100 on the meal, it wasn't about the money. It was about the fact that they failed to acknowledge that they charge heavily for substitutions.It's terrible that they've been getting away with such rude behavior and poor service. Zero tip and never visiting again. Thank you Yelp!
1	If I could give this place zero star, I would.  Went there for lunch, and ordered a spaghetti with meatball, and we asked the server if it it's considered lunch, since it's not on the menu.  Then he said even though it's not on the menu, they can still make it.  The lunch special I ordered including soup is about $11, and when we got the bill, I was shocked that they charged us $15 for the spaghetti with meatball, and another $7 for the soup.  Since it was not on the menu, and the server didn't inform us that they will charge extra for the soup when we ordered it, since my lunch special came with the soup.  And, we asked if it's lunch when we placed the order, but the server just try to argue with us for the charge, so we were just like whatever. It's not about the money.  We will never go back to this place again, poor customer service.
5	I was a bit skeptical coming to the place as the neighborhood is "off the strip".  The atmosphere inside is very much like a home style restaurant.  I had the  Penne Alla Vodka and it was amazing!  Loved the taste and loved the texture. Would come back every time now that I have tried it.  Had a Groupon deal for $15 off and so my bill came out to $5 at the end.  Left a big tip for the food.
5	Best Italian on or off the strip... a home cooked meal that nothing can compare too!!! Every one here is so pleasant and they make you feel at home.. eaten at all the places in this town and there is no better Italian in town.. Noras who?????
5	Not at all disappointed in this find! I was looking for quiet dining for one (here on business) and pasta ... and I found Pasta Mia on yelp. The experience was wonderful. Artichoke appetizer is delicious -similar to how my mom made it soaked in garlic butter but also stuffed, pasta pomodoro was creamy heaven and the flavor was spot on. The service is fantastic too - I had three waiters come check on me regularly - all were sweet and attentive and personable. Two thumbs ups for my first yelp review ever! Try pasta Mia for off the strip dining - you shall not be disappointed..
1	I will give this place bad review, the waiter wasn't nice at all no patient food come out too slow
4	Oh. My. Goodness.This Italian place is seriously a hidden gem in Vegas. I never knew it was here until I found the groupon! So boyfriend and I decided to take a look and check it out.It's hidden in the corner so look for it! It's pretty big on the inside. We were seated really quickly. It kind of took a while for the waiter to grab our drink order though. He also took the orders of these people who came in after us, and my boyfriend definitely knew I would yelp about that. Then, the busser came with water and garlic bread (we got it before those girls did) and the bread was SOO good. The other yelpers weren't lying! You definitely need to dip it inside the oil base that they provide you on the table. I am really craving some right now as we talk about it.So, I listened to the previous reviews and ordered the calamari. It. Was. Delicious. It's super crunchy and probably the best calamari I've ever had. It definitely did not disappoint me. They also give you a HUGE bowl of dipping sauce which, for me, is GREAT cause I like to smother my food with sauce (and usually when I get calamari elsewhere I would have to ask for extra sauce multiple times, lol). Now to the pasta. My boyfriend got chicken marsala and I got the spicy pasta! They were both mouth watering. Once again, smothered with sauce so no problem with flavor there. The pasta was cooked very nicely. And I was just amazed by the quality of the food!Thank you groupon for letting us find this place!
2	This is a tough place to review because the food is terrific and the prices are reasonable (especially so when you get a groupon deal) but they are terribly understaffed and the atmosphere of the place is old and outdated. The place is in dire need of remodeling.As for the staff, I would like to know exactly what the owner and his wife do while one waiter is working his ass off taking care of all of the tables by himself. When we were there the place was very busy. But they had only one waiter and one bus boy while we could see the owner doing nothing but counting his money at the register while his wife stayed by the door as a greater. This poor waiter was sweating working so hard while his boss did nothing, absolutely nothing to help out.Food good, service decent (if you arrive early) but very lazy, poor management. 2 1/2 star quality overall.
1	I feel I was ripped off at this restaurant. The waitress came to our table with a chalk board that had the specials.  I ordered the Osso Bucco.  She said it was their specialty. The board clearly said it was $31.95.  It was pretty good, but they put so much sauce on it that the pasta was soggy.  When the bill came it was $38.95.  I complained but they said that was the price. That totally spoiled the entire experience.  It was definitely not worth that price.  They said the eight got rubbed off the chalk board.  How do you rub off an eight and get a one?  We tried to rub off the "osso bucco" with a finger but it would not rub off.  They have another board with the $38.95 price, but that is not what they showed.  I read another review about overcharging at this restaurant, maybe it is their practice with the tourists.  I have pictures of everything.
1	This may have been a nice experience if it hadn't been for the grumpy waiter. He was definitely in a foul mood and seemed bothered we were there. When our food was delivered he did not place our plates in front of us he dropped  slammed them. He startled me. He never came back to check on us. He only came back to give us our bill. The food was ok but we will never be back.
1	This place came as a huge surprise. I went with a group of friends and we had heard that this place was great. I thought it was the exact opposite. The waiters, instead of taking our order, kept serving us water which almost made us late for the show we were seeing afterwards. It was also very expensive. For a cheap salad and a mediocre chicken parmesan it was around $30. I couldn't believe it. This placed seemed like it would have some real Italian food for a good price but I could not have been more wrong. I finished my food in less than 5 minutes that's how small of a portion their entrees are. I can say that this was a very dissatisfying venture and I wish I could've gotten my money back.
4	Tucked away hidden Italian restaurant..  Chicken Parmesan very tender, salad is small and Amazing.. Very juicy and not salty at all..
3	In the mood for Italian my wife and I decided on trying Past Mia. I fear going out for Italian food because it usually is a disappointment but the food here was ok. The menu is your basic menu of Italian food with some Romano style dishes. I had the Lasagna Bolognese and it came with a choice of soup or salad. I opted for the pasta fagioli.  The soup was a nice portion and very flavorful, I would come her again for some. The lasagna was also good but nothing out of this world. The Bolognese was more of a meat sauce, just meat and a lot of red sauce, not that great but still tasty and a large portion. I tried my wife's Linguini with white clam sauce and it was also very good. Service was also just ok. My wife asked for an iced tea 3 times and the server even repeated it but we never received one and we gave up asking. I sat underneath a picture of Andrea Aggasi from the 80's and that's the atmosphere of this place. They charge upscale prices for their dishes but do not put effort in keeping the restaurant  upscale. The wall underneath the picture was dirty and had stains on it. Even with the dim lighting you could see the mess. A second visit is not on the radar at this time. I would prefer paying more and eating Italian food on the strip for a few more dollars but certain the place is clean.
2	Mediocre place. Service is trying to sell over priced items. House wine is less than expectations. Overall experience is disappointed.
5	Food is phenomenal! Pasta fagioli yum :)  Super clean establishment, Friendly staff. The chef is onsite at all times, takes an active role in the customers requests ect, a real sweetheart. Great lunch specials.. I've eaten in and taken out, recommend either one. Nice little romantic place for dinner. prices are a little on the high side, but the food and overall experience is great.
