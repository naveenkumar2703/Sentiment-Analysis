5	I recently had a large pine tree removed from our rather small yard. The service was affordable, easily scheduled, and had great customer service support. The tree was quickly removed, and all of the associated debris were carefully cleaned up and removed.The crew hit an irrigation line while grinding the stump, but shut off the valve to prevent any leakage before repairs could be made. They also promptly notified me of the issue in person by knocking on the door and telling me. They returned the next day at no additional charge to make the quick repair.Pro Tree is also accredited by the Tree Care Industry Association, and recognized by the Better Business Bureau as an accredited business. I would highly recommend them for any tree related services you would need, and I will definitely call them in the future for any additional tree-related needs.
5	On time, quick service.   I had a large pine tree removed from my front yard.  Greg and the crew took it and the stump out.  They left the yard and front of the house clean.  You wouldf never know a tree was there or removed.  Would highly recomend.  Price was great also
1	This company is very unprofessional. No communication with customers. We attempted to hire them for a job but instead of having common courtesy to just decline the job he simply gave the ran around, excuses and then finally admitting he didn't want the job. Waste of our time! No showing while we sat waiting for them multiple times. We have multiple properties and know investors so this was defiantly THIER loss.
