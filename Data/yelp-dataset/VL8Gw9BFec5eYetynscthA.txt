3	This walgreens is ok but not the best compared to others.After many visits I notice I spend a lot of time waiting here. Waiting to pick up photos is my biggest issue. Last visit was a 6 minute wait for someone yo come yo the counter so I could get my photos. Very disappointing!Store is clean.Pharmacy is normally quick service.
1	as far as a walgreens go this one could be a lot better. the employees are not very helpful, the pharmacy is a joke. try to avoid this one, nothing to see here folks.....
2	Not the BEST walgreeNs been to & I dropped off my prescription and told them I will be back in a couple hours then 20-30 minutes later I get an automated phone message saying they're out of stock of my pills & my prescription will be ready TOMORROW.  Why couldn't they just tell me they were out when I dropped them off? I would of just went to another walgreens. Unbelievable. .... that's terrible customer service.
1	Terrible customer service!!!! Went on a Sunday morning and the woman who was at the window was so rude and obnoxious!!!! I just drove away and seriously can't believe how rude.  I will not be going back there.
