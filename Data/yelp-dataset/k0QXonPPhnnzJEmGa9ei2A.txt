5	I love watching the AZ Rattlers.  We've become big fans since moving to Phoenix.  The games are super exciting and you can get real close to the action.  Plus in 2011 they went to the Arena Bowl and lost at the last second....did that stop them?  No, they went back to the Arena Bowl and won!  They're the reigning AFL Champions and are doing well again this year.We always look forward to attending a game and the tickets are relatively cheap.  They're always running deals for local residents on tickets.  Our Son and his friends love to come an watch a game and we'll get tickets 5 to 10 rows from the field so they feel like they're part of the action.The players interact with the fans and if the ball flies into the stand during the game, you can keep the ball just like baseball!  It's pretty cool.  We have a collection of balls that we've caught from all of the games we've attended.The quality of football is pretty good too.  Both teams score a lot of points and there's always action on the field.  We're big fans of the Rattlers!Return Factor - 100%
5	The Rattlers are a great team to watch play.  The games are exciting and the fans are very involved with the team.  Unlike the NFL the Arena League allows fans access to the team, on the field, and there are seats right up to the side lines. I'm a season ticket holder and I also travel to watch some away games and they are all very fun to go to!The games are also more fun for kids than other sports games!
