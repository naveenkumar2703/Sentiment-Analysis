3	Brighton Collectibles always reminds me of a grandma shop for some reason. I think it's the way it's decorated but the goods inside are mouthwatering. Yes, I just described handbags as MOUTHWATERING. I would definitely shop here rather than the locatoin at Caesars. The sales associates are LIARS at the Brighton in Caesars. Read my review for an awesome detailed bedtime story.
4	Walking through the Canal Shoppes I figured there was no way I should be spending money on myself--mainly because it all seemed expensive.  Then I remembered I'd forgotten my jewelry to wear at my corporate conference.  I turned the corner and this beautiful jewelry store just appeared shiny and sparkly.  Figured I'd never be able to afford anything but oh well, I strolled in anyway.  Wow!  Beautiful stuff and doesn't break the bank.  Very classy necklace and earrings but only spend 85.  YAY!  And they have locations in Denver!  Double Yay!  Such a great place to buy a relative or great friend jewelry.  Shoes seem really cute too.  I luv when I find a new store to shop at!
3	Brighton is a class act. Their offerings are quality and there prices are in line. The folks here were a pleasant as could be and even offered me a bottle of water as I left.My only complaint is that it's tucked back off the canal.
