5	The few staff I've interacted with have been very pleasant and helpful, and the acupuncturist Matt Wagner has been fantastic at diagnosing and treating my allergies and sinus issues with acupuncture and herbs.  It's too early to say anything for sure but this has been my best spring for awhile!
4	My husband and I had purchased a Groupon for a couples massage and recently redeemed it. What a nice experience. My masseuse was Elizabeth and she was excellent. She found my trouble spots and worked on them. It was so relaxing. My hubby enjoyed his tremendouly as well. The only negative thing I might say was the room was lit fairly well and I prefer darker rooms for a massage. Maybe some blackout curtains? But I'll be going back!
5	I bought a Groupon for a one-hour massage. I had a choice between a therapeutic, acupressure, and Swedish. Since I don't like to be petted and am super ticklish, I went for a therapeutic one. Stephanie was amazing. She did a great job loosing up the knots I have in my shoulder area and she stretched me well too. I am very happy with the service I received. I would definitely recommend this place!
5	Got the groupon for 3 massages (an amazing deal), and went in for my first one today. The location wasn't particularly special - just a nondescript office building - but there was a nice view of the trees out the window and they've done a nice job making a relaxing atmosphere. Stephanie gave me the massage and she was excellent!! Perfect pressure, so relaxing! Can't wait to go for my next few massages. My only complaint was that I could hear someone having a conversation near our room (I think some sort of session as they were talking about products). Walls are thin so it would be nice if folks kept voices a bit lower, but it didn't distract much from a fabulous experience.
