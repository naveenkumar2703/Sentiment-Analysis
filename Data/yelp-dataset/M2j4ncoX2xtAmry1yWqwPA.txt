5	I've come here a few times over the years.  My trips were always never planned.  The fields are beautiful and are well maintained.  In Flanders fields the poppies blow      Between the crosses, row on row,   That mark our place; and in the sky   The larks, still bravely singing, flyScarce heard amid the guns below.We are the Dead. Short days agoWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,   Loved and were loved, and now we lie         In Flanders fields.Take up our quarrel with the foe:To you from failing hands we throw   The torch; be yours to hold it high.   If ye break faith with us who dieWe shall not sleep, though poppies grow         In Flanders fields.-- From the first chapter of In Flanders Fields and Other Poems, a 1919 collection of Lieutenant Colonel John Alexander McCrae, MD published after his death.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6BlOkpdkg8&feature=related
5	I enjoy searching cemetery records for my genealogy. I found National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona and the listings for all of my other cemetery searches here http://interment.net/data/us/az/maricopa/national/index.htm
5	It's kind of hard to rate a Cemetery don't you think?  Anyway, as we have a family member buried here out treatment was top notch.  Those that helped us during the ceremony was not only a veteren, but held other veterns to the highest Honor, regardless of the branch they served in.  It's sad to have to visit a place such as these, but it's nice to see that it is very well maintained and those intered there are Honored.
5	The staff was very friendly and professional.  The grounds were kept very clean.  The National Memorial Cemetery put on a very good memorial service for my Uncle.
