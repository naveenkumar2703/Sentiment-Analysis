3	The idea for Third Thursdays is a great one, but I don't think it is catching on like First Fridays in downtown Las Vegas. Third Thursdays occurs every third Thursday of the month on Water Street, a few blocks north of the convention center. It was around 5:45pm when I went, and the street seemed to be dead. I couldn't find the art gelleries at first, but after a bit of walking around jail bond businesses and antiques stores, one appeared. Why aren't they advertising!? So frustrating. Anyway, once I went inside there was a nice table complete with store bought brownies and bean dip. Surrounding this table was a small art exhibit. I am assuming the only four people there were the artists themselves. A man played (tinkered with) a guitar and another man was making some piece of jewelry. There was a box to place a vote for you favorite piece of art you saw, so I participated. I think I was the first vote in the box. The funny thing is that if Third Thursdays was advertised or marketed AT ALL, I believe a nice size crowd would show. City of Henderson, please listen: we need more events like this, with bigger crowds and more excitement. This is a great launching point, but give it a bit more "oomph" and let peeople know about it!
3	Third Thursdays is such a good idea in theory!! Henderson is really such a cute downtown area, and with so much change impending and high hopes for the future one day this third Thursdays will be really great and busy. The last time I went, I was the only one walking around. Also, art needs to be down there because A6 is the only gallery that is really doing it right! It will take a couple years to catch on! Keep on working!!
