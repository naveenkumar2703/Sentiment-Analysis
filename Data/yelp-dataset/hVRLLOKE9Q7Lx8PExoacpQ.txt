5	Im so happy to have found this place! Judee was fabulous with customizing the costume I choose. She changed the neckline and picked out all the accessories.I will continue to use your services and tell all my friends as well. THANK YOU!!!
3	Had a strange experience when I stopped by today. First of all, be aware that the costume shop and the fabric shop are now two separate stores - the fabric/bridal shop is located at 15246 Cave Creek (by appointment only, I should add), and the costume shop is a little further down the road. Judee was very kind and accommodating and offered to show me around the bridal shop even without an appointment. She said she had tons of fabric around but I saw only a handful of bolts and a glass counter full of unique, high-quality lace and trim. I'm guessing (and hoping) that she just doesn't have things quite set up since the move, because it would be really nice to have a resource for high quality fabrics in the Valley. Will probably stop by again to see if this happens, but if it doesn't, I don't foresee that I will become a regular customer. Judee seems great to work with though so based on this experience I do recommend her if you are looking for a custom gown made of beautiful fabrics you can't find anywhere else in Arizona.
