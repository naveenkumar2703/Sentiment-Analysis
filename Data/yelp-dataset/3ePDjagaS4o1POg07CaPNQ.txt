4	If you can handle the mind-jarring music, Styles for Less has some great bargains to be had. Lots of bright, trendy clothing and accessories. They had hats and shoes, plus belts, beads, & bags. Tons of fun and funky flip flops (Oh, don't-cha just love alliteration!).We found the same dresses we hade just seen at a mall store for $40-50 for only $19.99. They also have piles and piles of tanks and camis perfect for summer's layered styles. They ran 2 for $10 and 2 for $14.This store made both my daughters' and me very happy :)

We saw a blouse at a boutique for $50 and bought it here for $20! Can't beat it! And their clearance racks are the best! Don't sleep on this place - you'll miss out on savings!Friendly staff. Usually very helpful. Lots of promotions and sales going on year round.
