1	NEVER, ever go here. Worst service and unprofessional management ever. Ordered 4 tacos and a Coke. Couldn't get that right even after 10 minutes of time. 2 cars total in the drive thru. Poorly handled by "manager". Just awful service!!!By the way, the 2 tacos that they did give me where barely warm. Embarrasing...
1	This Jack in the Box get 1 star only because NO stars was an option.  The food is her is horrible and takes FOREVER to get.  The staff is rude and unprofessional.  On several occasions we have been offered "FREE" items if we would back up 2 feet while waiting in drive thru.  WE now know this is because each car is timed on how quick they get you out and by us backing up it reset the timers.  The staff is LAZY and the is shows in the food.  While in drive thru the other day the server left the window open and i acutally had to listen to to the Staff talk about their Manager and how they hated him.   NEW MANAGEMENT AND STAFF is what this place needs.  The owners need to take control of this store before they have no businessDO NOT EAT HERE!!!!
1	No joke, easily the worst Jack In The Box in the state. Dirty tables, rude employees, bad food.
5	They heard us wrong about our order. They fixed this quickly and efficiently. The food is fresh. My shake is yummy. For 1 in the morning the man with short black hair was extremely friendly and efficient. The store looked really, really clean.
