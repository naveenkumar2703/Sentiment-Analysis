4	It deserves a 4-star for both the food and the service! The fries are on-par or probably sub-par but it is not the point of this place though!
4	They have some great Gyros for great prices. The staff that own and run the place are super friendly as well. Definitely a great place if you're looking for a quick bite to eat on the east side.
4	It's a gas station!  It's a gyros shop! It's a Zizo!  Aren't you glad Zizo Cafe is also a character from Dr. SeussWould you could you with a fox?  Would you could you in a box? Zizo Zazu what?   I am not sure how they came upon Zizo but it is a fun little place tucked away on the North side in a cute metal grey box!Lamb gyros were recommended, so hit me up with a side of fries.  Friendly family service, a the place never slowed down even on a late lunch.You know you are at the right stop when the full kaleidoscope of people are here.  Me, the busdriver, a professor, an elderly couple are all in the same tight little spot eating gyros.Just a few tables so don't bring 20 friends.  It's attached to the gas station, so fill up the tummy and then the car.
