5	Celestia has amazing talent and is wonderful to work with. I have used Two Heads several times and always send my friends to them.  Whether it is a wedding, birthday or corporate event, everyone loves to have their caricature done.
5	I've hired Two Head Studios over a dozen times now and continue to be impressed.  They spread the gamut in terms of creativity.  I've had them do caricatures, drawings for shirts/mugs, my wedding cake topper!, drawings at my son's birthday party, puzzle map creations, Christmas cards, and they are the staple going away gift for individuals leaving my organization (beats a plaque hands down).  Always on budget and has NEVER missed a deadline.  But the most impressive part is their ingenuity and ability to create the most amazing products.  I've given specific detail on what I want and have also just provided a picture and said "Make this awesome!"  I have never been disappointed.  In fact, highly recommend the "Make this awesome" approach, their ideas are always much better than what I can come up with on my own.      I will, hands down, be a loyal and returning customer for as long as they are in business.  Exceptional.... absolutely exceptional.
5	Celestia attended our trade show last week for two days and she was absolutely amazing! She was in one of our exhibitor's booths doing caricatures for attendees and drove so much traffic for the exhibitor.She was so friendly, and her drawings were spot on of my co-worker and I. She goes pretty quickly for the amount of details she's able to capture and keeps you chatting and entertained the whole time. Hope I cross paths with her again!!!
