5	The staff at this location was fantastic! As a small location business owner I enjoy working with other local small businesses to put together a great product. Without hesitation they took on a job that was not usual for them and they made it AMAZING! When my son went to pick up our business name plate they told me how much they enjoyed working on this and were so proud of the work they did, they wanted to make another one to display in the store front. They were professional, friendly, on time, and delivered a great quality product. Thank you again for such a great job!
5	I ordered a large banner online from another company for my son's graduation from USAF boot camp.  When the banner came it didnt have grommets installed.  We didnt have enough time to send the banner back so I called Fast Signs to inquire about what it would cost to have the grommets installed.You know what happened?  They graciously took car of everything at no charge.  I was honestly touched by what they did.  They certainly didnt have to offer me anything for free.  I would say if you need any type of sign or advertising.  Use this place, they are definitley military family friendly.Thanks again Fast Signs!!!!!!Sincerely,Proud Air Force Family
5	Fast Signs were so accomodating and very quick each time I needed to order something. Within hours, I received an estimate and the customer service was top notch! Ask for Karen! She is the best!! Thank You Fast Signs for helping to get my new business going as quickly as you did!!
