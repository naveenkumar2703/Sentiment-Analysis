3	It was not busy and the saleswoman seemed bothered that I was asking the size of a belt in inches when it was a M or XL. Is that a crazy question? Shouldn't they know the answer or know how to measure a belt? All the employees I dealt  with there thought measuring a belt was like quantum physics. But they did check me out and gave me a coupon for $25 off in Jan. I will be back, but not to that one...except to exchange the belt.
4	This is a great location since it is not in a mall.  Plenty of parking, the store is never too crowded, and when they do their clearance sales there is still plenty to choose from.
5	This store is always clean, the staff is super friendly and they have a great selection of sale items.  This store is tucked away in Casa Paloma shopping area.  The shopping area is absolutely beautiful.  Banana republic makes quality clothing and has great sales.  This location has their separate email list for customers and has special events and sales that are exclusive to this location only.  I highly recommend stopping by this location when you're in the area!
