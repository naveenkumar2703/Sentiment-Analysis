4	I've been here a few times since they've opened.  Nothing bad to say about it.  The owners were there each time and were very friendly and engaging.  There isn't much to ask for in a coffee shop to fill my needs.  Warm environment, good coffee, fast and friendly service.  This place offers all of the above.  This is an express location so it's not very large but there are a few chairs.  They have some baked goods as well.The only problem with it could be the location.  Protip: park in the AT&T parking lot and walk over if you need to head back east, otherwise you have to drive down and eventually turn back around since the median is in the way and no left town out of the lot.If you're driving by, stop in and grab a cup.  It's leaps and bounds better than the nearby coffee shop alternatives.

I love the coffee drinks, the mugs they serve them in, the live music in the back (although I wasn't always a fan when i was studying) and the general character of the shop. I will say, I haven't been back to Madison since 2007, so I wouldn't know of any changes that have happened in the last couple years. However, I've frequented dozens of coffee shops in several cities and Steep & Brew is still towards the top of my list.
