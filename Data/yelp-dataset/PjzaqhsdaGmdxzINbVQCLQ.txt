5	He is an amazing pediatrician, very smart, has an MD and JD.  They have a very busy practice but he never makes you feel rushed.  He listens to concerns and gets along well with my would be doctor husband.
5	Dr. Robertson listens to "mother's instinct" and he works with me  to ensure great health for my 2 year old and 8 year old. I switched my pediatrician of 6 years to go to him and I am so mad at myself for not doing it 6 years earlier!!
4	Very good pediatrician. I am taking my  2 years old son since birth, I would highly recommend Dr. Robertson to anyone. I am not rating 5 star, because of even it is very easy to do appointment but it takes very long to wait.
