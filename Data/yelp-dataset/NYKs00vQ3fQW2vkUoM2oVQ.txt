5	Just giving it a five-star, because its like any Claire's accessories stores I have been, too. The service I receive are always great and friendly.  I can easily find the things I need right away and check-out is quick.
5	Came in to get my 3 month old daughter ears pierced. Shanika was our piercer and she was very nice and patient with us. Originally, I didn't like where she placed the dots but she explained why it was better in that position. My husband gave his approval on the placement so I went with it. I am very glad I went with the placement, it's perfect! Shanika took her time (actual time for everything took about 20min or so) and when it got the the piercing part did it very quick. We are so pleased with shanika and the store location
4	Located in the target plaza tucked away in the very corner, this is a solid spot to get any accessory you need. I needed a lanyard for my work keys since my old one broke. I asked the sales clerk where they would be and she pointed me to the selection they had. There were a few but for $10 each, I wasn't loving any design. After wondering around the clearance section, I found one that had "adorkable" written on it and was on sale for $2!!! Score!! They had a ton of cute wallets, necklaces and clutches as well!! I'll definitely be back if I'm in need of a quick accessory.
