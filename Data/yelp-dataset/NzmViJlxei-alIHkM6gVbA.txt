4	We took a queue from the "Best of" series this weekend and checked out this little local sandwich and pizza place. As a rule, I'm generally not into sandwich places (see also: my review of Duck and Decanter). When the gf suggested it, I wasn't excited about the prospect of another eight dollar sandwich spilling over with strange greens that tasted like feet. However, on this occasion I obliged. When we arrived, my first reaction was to be impressed by the setup. There is a cool little fountain just outside in the corner (of the strip mall) and for a warm spring day, it was perfect. Inside, there was an older couple that apparently could sense that we were first-timers and were quick to assure us that we were "in for a treat." We both ordered sandwiches that were good, surprisingly good, and flavorful. I ordered a chicken sandwich with bacon and carmelized onions and it came out after a short wait with a side of mixed greens in a light dressing. I'm definitely planning a second visit to check out their pizza (I saw some white pizzas being cooked that looked dee-lish) and maybe another sandwich or two, as well.So far, so good.
4	Really, really nice people but not spectacularly good food.  Pretty inexpensive and interesting.  Strange kinds of pizza that are pretty awesome and some good salads.
1	I think this place is CLOSED. Their # is out of service.
