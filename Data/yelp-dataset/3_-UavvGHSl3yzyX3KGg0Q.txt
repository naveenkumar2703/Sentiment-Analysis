4	Fast service there today. I was in and out in no time through their drive up. Food was fresh and hot and very good.
2	Oh my goodness!  Employees are so grumpy!We tried to go through the drive through to get our free satisfries. We were told we could only get one order per car do we had to park and go inside.  Kind of ridiculous. Satisfries = meh.
2	This is the closest Burger King to where I live and we go here because BK is the only fast food place around that has a veggie burger for my daughter.  The problem with this place is their drive-thru.  You gotta check carefully every time you get your food to make sure you get everything you ordered.  More than once, I've brought bags full of food home to find that one or more things either didn't get entered in right or weren't given to me right.Some places are right on and always give me what I order first time, no repeats.  This is not one of those places.  Grumble.
2	Service in the drive-thru was fast, but apparently these workers all speak limited English and cannot get the order right.  I asked for a 2-pc cinnabon meal. I got and paid for a 1-pc meal. Didnt notice until after we drove away,  because it was in a box and who pulls their stuff out while they are driving?
1	They advertise macaroni and cheese and apple fries but they don't have that and they didn't even tell me. When I ordered apple fries I go through and I get apple slices with peels. For my child who is a year old that's not going to cut it with the peels. When I asked them about it they said sorry that they no longer sell it. I asked them why they advertise it and they said that it was because of corporate and not their particular facility. Not cool. And not customer friendly.
2	Staff is not very friendly,  got our order wrong but replaced it with correct after arguing with me. 2 stars are for good food once received and clean play area. Customer service very poor! : (
