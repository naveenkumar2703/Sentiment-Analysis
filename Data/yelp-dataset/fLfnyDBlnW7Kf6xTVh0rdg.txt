1	Sorry but I reserved online for this place. I got there after 11PM. There was a door you basically could not open without an attendant. A number I dialed rang the inside phone with no answer. I sat outside for about ten minutes with some awkward drunk guy pacing around. Finally, someone else lets us in and I wait another 15 minutes for an attendant to actually come to the front desk. NEVER going there again. Thanks Hotwire.com

They quickly made calls and found it. Turns out I was at the other one. The other one? Ya. This company has two separate hotels on one property. Kinda stupid if you ask me. So I went over and they eventually got me in. My room was nice... Had all the pleasantries and even a kitchen which was very nice. But the place is a bit weird. There was a group of guys drinking in the lobby (they looked like employees, but I can no confirm that). But it was just awkward. Not really a lobby that you'd drink in.... Also that was the only part of the place that was a bit dirty. The workout room was a bit lacking.... But whatever. All in all, this place had a "my wife just kicked me out of the house" feeling to it. Kinda depressing. But that's not their fault... Just kinda sad.

When he called to make the reservation, they asked if it was a special occasion and he told them it was my birthday.  They not only gave us a free upgrade, but when we checked in, waiting in our room were a balloon, a card, and a beautiful bouquet of spring flowers!  Room was clean and staff were great--thanks, Tyler and all!
