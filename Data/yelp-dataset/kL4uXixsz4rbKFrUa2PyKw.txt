5	I had the best service by Alliance Financial Resources, namely the loan officer David Creed.  I had applied with 7 loan companies and was turned down everytime.  David was very detailed and was able to get me approved for my loan.  He is the best loan officer I have ever dealt with.   If you want the best please call David Creed at Alliance Financial Resources.
1	Be very causious with this location.  They are extremely unprofessional.  They wear flip flops and shorts to work every day.  They smoke right outside a door that is marked "smoke free area".  In the middle of a deal, the person handling the transaction left the company.  Originally given a close date and then called 3 days prior to close to be told I didn't qualify.  Then the Manager pushed the deal thru.  Now I'm concerned who will have my loan and if it's legitimate.  Then police were there because the person left, had come back and taken information of Customers.  Very scary that someone has my information that I didn not agree to.
5	Great Service!!
5	This place has been nothing but amazing. This is my second time working with Billy and he has been so wonderful. He explains things very clear so that I  understand what is happening every step of the way. He always takes my calls and updates me either through email or phone to let me know what he needs or where we are in the process. I have nothing but good things to say about him and the people he works with. I recommend him 100%. He never once made me feel like he was working with me just to make the deal go though. We discussed options and figured out what would work best with me and my financial situation. If you want to get a good deal and get it it done fast... this place is the way to go. We closed my home purchase in 2 week. He's that good!
