4	When I need gas and a quick burger this is where I go.  Yes, it's a McDonalds, but the folks who run Four Sons are very nice!
3	Nice little gas station with a minimal set of snacks and such, but they do have a McDonalds attached to it which is nice.  Lot of parking too because it bumps up against Albertsons parking lot.  Nice staff.
4	A gas station, convenience store, and a McDonalds all rolled into one.  This place comes in handy from time to time.  I drop in to fill my tank or grab a snack.  More recently, I've been buying Powerball tickets here....especially since it's sister store in Fountain Hills sold the huge $300+ mil winning ticket a couple of months ago.Return Factor - 80%
4	Good service and nice people.  I have never had any problems here.  After getting snarky attitude from the AM/PM down the road, this will be my preferred stop!
