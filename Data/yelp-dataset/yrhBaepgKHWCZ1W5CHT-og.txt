4	Reflexology is more than a foot massage, it's a natural healing therapy. It provides longer term wellness by removing the cause of the ailment and working in a holistic manner. It had been a long time since I had been to Vegas and wow did I have a huge surprise after the first day. It does not matter if you have heals, clogs, flat sandals, etc....there is no shoe that can endure this pain. All of the casino's are so large even when you drive and by time you park your vehicle the walk is long and very hard on your feet. I enjoy walking but try walking in 90 plus dry heat on hard surfaces all day and night. Oh the pain on your poor little feet. All four of us were walking around the strip and at one point we all thought we would never make it back to our hotel. Yes, the Universe felt our pain .A young man was standing on the corner with a huge sign was this reflexology foot massage place. I wanted to wrap my arms around him and kiss him. We tried to run there as it was right around the corner. The price was one dollar per minute, well worth it. I could and wanted to stay a full hour but we had a show to get to and did not have much time. All four of us laid down on chairs that reclined into beds. The place was beautiful and very clean. These guy's were insanely good. Short little men with hands that could cause some pain. As I laid there getting reflexology there was a bit of pain as he put pressure on areas that needed it. From the massage, the oil's used we were all in heaven. This is exactly what we all needed. We felt great, the guy's were all very nice and funny. They are pushy, they beg you to do a full hour of course and oh how we wanted to. Great place if you need some much needed relief, check them out. Located right on the strip. Very peaceful, soft lights, relaxing lounge leather chairs, soft music with great smells throughout. A great treat!
