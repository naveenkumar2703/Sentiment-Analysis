5	What's better than a smoothie in 100 degree weather? Yum :)Cool, clean location with friendly and efficient service.Husband got the Power Pro which came with options of protein, fruit, and juice types (he chose whey, blueberries, and mango juice). Kids each chose pina cooladas, and I grabbed a dairy free ginger mango tango. All came with a free boost and all were delectable :D
5	I give 5 stars because they recently retrofitted most stores to have Raw juice available. It's not cheap but if you are juicing and on the go, it is perfect! They also allowed me to get a punch card for my juice habit even though its usually just for smoothies. I am loving the raw juice.
1	I was here a couple of weeks ago and got there early, like 5 minutes before they opened ... at 9am I think.  Total darkness.  I could hear birds chirping but I was like, "Okay, I'll wait a little bit longer."  Five minutes past the hour and still nobody.First of all, what the heck at opening so LATE IN THE MORNING?!?!?!?!?!?!!  Secondly, why wasn't anybody there when the doors are supposed to open?!The smoothies aren't bad but the servers really aren't very happy people.  I never get a positive vibe when I go in.  The service is fine just not very chipper people, which is what I expect from a smoothie place.P.S.  We've been coming here since they opened and the smoothies are decent ... 3 stars definitely but I was just really ticked off that they weren't open ... that's just bad business.
4	Friendly and clean! Although not all staff is knowledgeable about their products. They can make them well they just can't tell you nutritional values and their brochures do not list all menu items.
