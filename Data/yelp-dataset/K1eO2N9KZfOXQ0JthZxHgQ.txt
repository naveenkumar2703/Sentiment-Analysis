5	Bill is a very knowledgeable agent who takes pride in the management of his properties and is professional in his interactions with his clients. Definitely recommend for your property management needs.
5	I purchased a property in April of 2013, which will eventually become a second home, but in the interim I was looking to rent it. Since I live out-of-state I felt I needed a property manager. I called several companies, some of which were referred to me and others I found via the internet. When I spoke with Bill at Full Service Properties Inc., I knew that he would be the right choice. He clearly laid out his services and fees and took the time to answer my questions. His screening process of prospective tenants is well thought-out and covers all of the necessary criminal and financial background checks. Upon receiving the keys, Bill quickly secured a fantastic tenant. Every month I receive my statement and check in a timely manner and Bill quickly responds to/with any necessary communication and information regarding the unit or tenant. I highly recommend Bill Forst and Full Service Properties Inc.
