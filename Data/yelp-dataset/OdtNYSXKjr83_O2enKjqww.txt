5	Simple stated, I love chocolates and treats. When I travel to the Netherlands and Belgium every 2 years I usually bring back lots of Chocolates since my wife and my bosses wife are as addicted to chocolate as I am.     I found this company a few years ago to help fill my chocolate desires in between visits. They use the best chocolate I've tasted here in the states. Even the dark chocolate melts in your mouth. These beat out just about every chocolate I've had any place else and all the Belgian and all but one Chocolatier in Amsterdam. But theirs are totally different.     I have 2 favorites. There Desert Tortoises (Chocolate Turtles) are all hand made and simply the best Turtle around. The caramel inside is perfect, chewy with lots of flavor. My wife loves them.     My other favorite are the NINJA NUTS. Peanuts with a spicy Wasabi coating dipped in Dark Chocolate. Unbelievably addictive and everyone I know loves them after they have had a few. They disappear from my house much to fast.     They also have some wonderful Pecan Sandies.       It has recently opened a store and are still arranging things but it's worth stopping by.
5	Soooo goooooood!! Handmade chocolate, creative and delicious! Truffles are a must! And get this chocolate covered BACON! They are making one of a kind Easter baskets made to order! They have everything to tempt your sweet tooth. The owners Judy and Ed are very nice and they obviously take pride in their store, if you are in the Fountain Hills area this place is a must for treats!  Loved it!
