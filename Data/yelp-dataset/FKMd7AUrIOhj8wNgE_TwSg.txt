5	If you want someone who is kind, compassionate, passionate, and who, just by being in her presence makes puts you in a better place  - Lorel & Revitalize Bodywork fits the bill.   I've known Lorel for gee - maybe 30 years now, maybe more - she's really one of those rare people who is meant to be a healer - in every way .  Always positive, and always kind, Lorel truly has your health and soul in her best interests.
5	First I had a few massages which were really great. Now I'm training with Revitalize Bodywork to get fit for the summer. Lorel is terrific. She's really focused on improving my health, but my workout sessions are fun too. The investment in my health has made me feel better and I'm less stressed when I go to work.
5	Several years ago I met Lorel through volunteer work that we did for the same organization in Phoenix.  Fast forward to a head-on car accident in 2006 that left me with constant neck and back pain.  Since engaging Lorel as a massage therapist and recently undertaking fitness training with her, my back feels much better.  Lorel really understands the needs of her clients and pushes - but just to the limit that individual can do.  I lover her approach to overall health and fitness.  She is amazingly positive.
