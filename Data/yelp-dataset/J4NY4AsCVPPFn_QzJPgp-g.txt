2	I don't know if the oxygen works or not. What I did realize is that they hold you captive with the oxygen tubes in your nose and then try and sell you overpriced massage gadgets. I had wanted to try it just for fun but what i quickly found out is that It was not worth the time or the money.The only reason it gets two stars is because the girl behind the counter was nice. That's it.
3	This kiosk at the Southwest wing of the airport in Las Vegas is a really good idea, considering all the second-hand smoke you are sure to be exposed to when in Sin City.  I had a headache, likely from a combination of lack of sleep, exposure to cigarette smoke, and the sudden temperature change I experienced upon entering the airport (no, I was not hung over); a good dose of O2 seemed ideal.  Sometime during my fifteen minutes with the nasal cannula on, I remembered my hospital experience as a nurse supplying supplemental O2 to patients.  Duh.  You're not getting pure oxygen.  You're getting a little extra mixed in with everything else you're breathing (plus a light fragrance).  This wasn't going to do much for my headache and I started to regret the money I just threw away.  However, the "package" I purchased came with a demonstrations and sample of some of the products they had for sale.  I got some refreshing oils applied to my hands to breathe in, I got to try a funky device with electrodes that made my muscles twitch, a got a mini-massage and scalp massage using other odd looking devices.  I must admit, they felt good.  I wouldn't blow money on the O2 again, but I would on the massages...
