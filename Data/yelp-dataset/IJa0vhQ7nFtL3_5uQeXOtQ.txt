4	Was in this afternoon, looking at shirts to keep cool and stylish for the summer. The sales staff were pleasant upbeat and helpful.
5	We popped in on a very hot Arizona evening and the sales associate overheard my seven year old son say he was thirsty.  She brought him both a glass of water AND her bottle water that she had brought from home for herself.  That is the sweetest offer (of course, we didn't take the bottle from her, just the glass!)  That earns a five star in my book and thank you for being so kind and generous.  I will pay it forward, I promise.  Thanks Scottsdale Banana for hiring great employees.  Oh and my husband got a great shirt  on sale that he needed for work--a win, win!!
5	I love Banana Republic at Kierland. The guys who work there are sweet, kind, nice, and bend over backwards to give you great service and the best deal possible. I'm usually shopping there for my husband or adult son, so I really appreciate the extra attention. The store manager and the other guys on the floor are so great. I don't mean to leave out the gals who work there, but I'm generally in the men's section. Whoever raised these fine young gentlemen: Good job. And thanks to the guys themselves for a super pleasant experience every time, for more than two years now.
