4	Not bad! This place is overwhelming at first! I love how the jewelry is organized by each color. Some of the items are overpriced for the quality but they have a variety...and I mean a VARIETY, to choose from. They also have cute scarves and some clothing options organized according to color as well. Love that! I definitely will be coming back for some jewelry for my Vegas trips.
4	OMG, I was so overwhelmed I did not buy anything.  They have everything and anything.  Color coordinated:  shoes, jewelry, purse, wallets, clothes, bags, etc.....  I couldn't process all the things.  Prices are ok.  I need to go back and figure out what I want to get.
3	Everything is color coordinated here. This is a place to accessorize. It is organized and very big. I was in and out. Most of the jewelry reminded me of the alley in Los Angeles. You can find a lot of it at the alley for 1.00 or less. But if you need something to go with that outfit and cant make it out to the Alley lol then go here. It is a cute place.
1	The one downtown has amazing customer service but I do not recommend shopping at the Goodyear location. Three workers were literally standing around the front door chatting and completely oblivious.
