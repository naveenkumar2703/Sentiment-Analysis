4	One thing I was very much spoiled by living in California, was the lack of pomp and circumstance around sushi - here, it still seems to be a more expensive dining option left for more auspicious occasions rather than a quick lunch or casual meal with friends. Nagoya reminds me of the hole in the wall type places that I used to frequent all so often. The prices are perhaps not super friendly to the wallet, but their miso soup is the nicest I've had in town, and there is very little flare to their delivery. You can hear the microwave ping when the sake is warmed up. But, it's goooooood. Fish tastes fresh, and the rolls are tasty. As I mentioned before, best miso soup in town - packed full of flavour. The boy had Okayudon (spelling dodgy), which he reported to be flavourless, but had shown him a new side of Japanese food, a side that was more open to someone who was not a lover of raw fish. Overall, it's my kind of sushi joint - delivers solid food, good service in a good place. Highly recommend it.
