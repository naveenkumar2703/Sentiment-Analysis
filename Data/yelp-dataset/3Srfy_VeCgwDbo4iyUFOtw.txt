1	My co-workers and I refer to this place as "Pizza n' Ants".  The staff will be happy to serve you with bare hands, right after using the till.  Also, as the nickname suggests, there has been a noticable insect problem. As if that could all be overlooked, the pizza isn't even good.  If you are in this part of town, go to Z Pizza or Slices for great pizza instead!
1	this place is just gross.  we got a salad that seemed to have been sitting around for a week and the pizza was terrible.  we will never go back.
1	I was ok with the lunch special until the ants came marching.That and I've never had so much grease on my pizza either...
2	Overpriced pizza, pizza is edible but very greasy, unhelpful employees, and bad environment.Today my mom decided it was a pizza night. Unfortunately she chose this place which is understandably five seconds from our house. When we went to pick up the pizza the guy behind the counter would not get off his cell phone! I definitely wouldn't want to eat there it seems very poorly run. Although the larges were very large, I thought it was very overpriced. Decent enough, but very salty. If I was going to order a Pizza to eat at home I prefer Papa John's over this place!
1	pretty terrible pizza joint.  I like TJ's much more.  I've tried this place twice, and both times, it was pretty bad.  The first time, I just ordered two slices.  They took two pretty old cheese pieces of pizza out of their warming rack, threw on pepperoni and mushroom on top if it, and just served it.  I think the pizza had been in the warming rack for several hours.  The second time I tried them, I just ordered a small pizza so I knew it would be fresh.  It was, very bleah, even for pizza.  Don't  waste your money.
