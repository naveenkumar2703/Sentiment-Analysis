4	I have been going to Northern Avenue Eye Care for 4 years now. The amazing staff has not changed in the four years, and I love it! Joy, the receptionist is so warm and inviting. She has greeted every patient with their name every time I've been in, and I love that we can talk about my dance career since her daughter in law is also a dancer. Janelle is incredible with fittings and is also very friendly. Dr. Chung is an adorable woman and makes you feel instantly at ease. I only wish the office was in a better location, but it's close to home!
5	Great work, fair and professional.  love you guys
5	No complaints here.  The glasses are perfect.  I got Trivex lenses with digital progressive.  They are very comfortable, my eyes just relax looking through these lenses.  I had to return glasses from another place because I could feel eyestrain.  They had a good selection of lenses with a good range of prices.  They were also very quick.  They had the glasses adjusted right away and I was out the door.  I did not have my eye exam there so can't comment about that.
