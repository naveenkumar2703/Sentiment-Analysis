5	Best taqueria in North Vegas, period. Maybe even all of Vegas. I usually go with tres azada tacos , dos de pollo and dos al pastor. Get some guacamole too, which they serve in a styrofoam coffee cup. Wash everything down with a mandarin jarritos mexican soda, and you'll be golden! This place is the bomb, and reasonably priced. Sketchy shopping center though.
4	The food is great.  My favorite is the carne asada.  Anything you eat will be good, except for any vegetarian adaptations.  I order some bean and cheese tortas because I was not in the mood for meat and one cook made it good while another cook did a horrible job.  I could've done better at home.  If you stick to what is on the menu you should be okay.  The place is really small so if you're claustrophobic or come with a group you should order to go.  Portions are good and everything is fresh right down to the sauces in the mini bar.  Like Mike said, the shopping center is in a bad location so come early.
5	I come here every weekend, I love the food! Plus it's inexpensive as well.
1	The food is really not good specially since i know what authentic mexican food tastes like. Would not recommend it.
5	This place is money, anyone who says otherwise is wrong! Al pastor tacos for the win!
2	My wife got diarrhea pretty bad after eating from this place. The meat was chewy, the rice and beans tasted old and cheap like from a can. Nothing really tasted good except maybe  the fries out of my carne asada fries. I would prefer Robertos to place any day, and I don't like Robertos...
