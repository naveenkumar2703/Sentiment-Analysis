1	stay far away!!! bad neighborhood, too start.. whatever you do, please....do not use the car wash.  Corp. PDQ. does not care about customer service, matter of fact they don't care at all, if their machine rips apart your car, "ITS YOUR OWN FAULT"!!! you should have gone somewhere else, & there are many other places to shop and buy gas in Madison, stay away from PDQ at all cost. the suck!!!!
4	This is a nice gas station and very convenient.  In fact all the PDQs are pretty well run, well lit, well organized, efficient and competatively priced.   They have some pretty good sandwiches and salads if you need something quick in the morning to have with you for lunch.   The price is about 4 bucks on average per item.   They used to have Neuman's Own dressing packets for free but last I was in there it was Kraft.   Please bring back the Neuman's Own.One tip, at this store there are freeloaders that hang out in the morning.  They will hit you up for cash, gas and sometimes for food.   I no longer get my gas in the early morning hours as a result.  Same goes for all the stations on Fish Hatch as far as when to get your gas.
3	They have quite a lot of stuff just like a small supermarket would. Even a copy machine and beer!!... I guess the gas prices here are fair. Staff is very nice. Well kept gas station all around.
