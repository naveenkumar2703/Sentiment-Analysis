1	I am very displeased with Bunker Cemetery and Mortuary. My father passed away 4 years ago. I have visited him twice a year since that time. Two weeks ago I took my sister, and her family, to visit his grave for the first time. When we got there we immediately noticed that the grave marker was missing. I walked over to the office and was told that an order would be put in to find the marker .The excuse given was that grass grows very quickly in Las Vegas and it was possibly buried. My information was given and someone would call me. I did not receive a call. I called on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. I never spoke to a person. Finally, I called my sister to ask for her help. I was too involved and needed the relief of help. She took over with gusto and was a promised a call back in regards to this issue. She did not receive a call back. That following Tuesday she called me to inform me that she had spoken to Manager John Laskey . Apparently because the grave markers are considered a "90 day marker" (which was never explained to us) and we left it there for longer than the recommended time, we are responsible for it. I honestly don't have a problem with that. What I have a problem with is the fact that we had to call 5 times to get someone to talk to us. Also, why were we not given a courtesy call when the marker was either stolen or broken? I find this customer service to be appalling. This is not a sweater shop. You are dealing with the loved ones of people who have passed. Show some compassion.
