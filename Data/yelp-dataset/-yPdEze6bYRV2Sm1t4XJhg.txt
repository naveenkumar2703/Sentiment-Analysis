4	File this under "C" for "Cheesy franchise burger joints that I can't seem to get enough of." Rather than rattle off the dozen or so things that I can't stand about this place, I'll settle with expressing the opinion of the silent majority inside my mouth. And that is: These burgers are tasty. And the topping bar as the "2" of that 1-2 punch is pretty devastating, leaving me with no choice but to heartily endorse this family-friendly shop of horrors. At least I'm honest.
4	Ditto to Jake & the Squid.
4	This location is THE PLACE to take your kid's team for an end-of-season party.  They accommodate large parties, take reservations for large parties AND allow you to decorate your tables with your team theme!    Equally important:   they LEAVE YOU ALONE during the process--- so if you are a frantic "gotta get it ready & it's gotta be perfect" last-minute-crafty-maven like myself, THAT'S A GREAT THING.They play fantastic-classic rock & roll, as in 50's & 60's & they have really, I MEAN REALLY cleaned the joint up.  New upholstery, fresh paint & all done WELL.  Top that with 'cooked to order' burgers that are CONSISTENTLY out of this world & you too will shout WINNER!
