1	Not sure if it was too late (9 pm?...haah), or if those in the kitchen were cooking with drowsy palates...ANYWAY, after driving around with indecisive passengers the other night, we all finally agreed on this place. Initially excited... we were not so much enthralled by dinner's end. I got the Award Winning Gyro Dinner. Personal opinion of this- not very award winning, and did not even intrigue my eyes. Beef and lamb were dehydrated and vegetables originated from a freezer bag. Was given scarce pieces of pita (should have just brought my own bag of pita chips since this was the case), and the tzatziki was not the distinct  blend of yoghurt accompaniment... it was ranch dressing. The gyro dinner is a far cry from award winning, dishonorable mention to say the least. I suppose my dish and I disliked each other so much that my doggy bag committed suicide atop my car, and became mere slop on the pavement.
3	Most people dislike this place because it is a chain.  I have been here in the past lets say a few years back and the service was horrible... that I do remember.  I also recall that I wasn't blown away by the food.  Yesterday I was craving Greek and thought I should give it another try. I came for lunch and the service was friendly and attentive.  The hummus was very good.  I also enjoyed my falafel pita... not the best I have ever had, but good.  So now that they seem to have improved their service issues I will definitely be back for lunch again sometime soon.
