3	Great location, great views, slightly shabby hotel.You can tell it's been here a while, as you can still smell the smoke as you walk in. It's got the familiar terrible carpets and wipe-dry curtains in the lobby and rooms, and the staff are just about interested enough but nothing to impress you.The room we had was surprisingly decent - at least compared to the lobby areas and the other rooms of our party. We did ok. Shame about the two single beds bolted together to make a double though.The breakfast buffet was very good - it even included haggis!Location is fantastic. Right on Princes Street opposite the Scott monument. We had great views of the castle too.
2	For the price, not the greatest experience. Like Craig M. says, it's fairly dated, but the rooms are passable. Great views, if slightly noisy if you have street-facing windows. The staff were very hit-or-miss, ranging from completely unaccamodating to friendly and helpful. Big minuses: no WiFi unless you're in the lounge at perscribed times or want to pay 15 pounds a day for it, and no adapters for my sad USA plugs. I was directed to the supermarket, and then to Marks&Spencer, and then they were out of ideas. It was a good location, but if I'm back in Edinburgh I probably will not opt to stay there again.
