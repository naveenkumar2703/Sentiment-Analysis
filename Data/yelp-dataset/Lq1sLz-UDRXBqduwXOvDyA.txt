1	I'm in search for the best Pastrami in Las Vegas. First stop Subway. I ordered the 6 in. Pastrami. The portion of Pastrami was small compared to add ons. The meat lacked flavor, even the jalapenos I added had no heat. So, no suprise here.
4	Was in the area and stopped by for lunch.  It was around 1 pm and the restaurant was empty....perfect!  I ordered a 12" BMT, toasted, on Italian Herbs and Cheese Bread ($6).The Sandwich Artist made my sammie to order and it tasted very good.Another great visit to Subway.  They're pretty consistent and that's why they're one of my favorite places to go when I want a quick, cheap meal.Will I return?  Sure.
1	I walked in earlier this week at 7an in the morning, no one in the place, and they wouldn't toast only 1/2 of my foot long sandwich, although it was only tuna, nothing else on the sandwich. I contacted subway corporate and they had the store manager reach out to me. The store manager gave me a 1 min story about employee theft and I just zoned out after that point cause this guy has no idea the customer comes first, before his internal challenges. Fix the prob internally without affecting customer service. Huh. Not going back to this subway store, especially when 2 other subways I frequent honor my request.
3	I only come here for the convenience of location. Their turn over rate is ridiculous. There are always brand new employees always working alone with no extra help. And when I return a few weeks later those employees are replaced with brand new ones. The food is prepared well, I don't have a complaint about that. I think maybe the owner is cheap and doesn't have 2 people on every shift in order to save money. I hate coming here and damn myself every time I leave because the length of time it takes to make 3 sandwiches is unbearable. Hire more employees!
