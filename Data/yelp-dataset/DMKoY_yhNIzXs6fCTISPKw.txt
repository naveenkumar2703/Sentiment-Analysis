1	This place is far the worst place to get your nails done.  It burned my nail while he was filing it down.  Usually my fills are smooth but when you rub over the nail its bumpy as hell.  I RECOMMENED neverrr go to this place.  This place sucks
3	Us ladies needed to get our toenails did.....badly!!  We stumbled upon Ex Nails that charged $20 for a spa pedicure.  Four of us came into the nail salon and were swiftly greeted by chemical smells enough to cause me a huge headache.  So let me outline the pros and cons of this place.Pros:*Awesome massage chairs!  It's got the rollers to massage my shoulders and back.*Plethora of fashion and gossip magazines.*Nail polish hasn't chipped since getting it done 1 week ago.Cons:*Strong chemical smell in the salon.*Wish my lady had rubbed my legs and feet a little longer.*Salon looked a little dirty/unkept.
2	Not the best place to get your toes done. They use cheap polish, mine smudged like an hour after I left the shop. The massage chairs are nice and they do have plenty of great magazines. Just go here if your desperate!
4	Great Quality and very close to my office! I can get my toes tickled and painted during lunch hour!
2	This is my second time here and they left me sitting in this seat for more than 30min... While they are taking care of ladies who came after me, and i do not think theyve made their appointments. I can find this kind of service at the next corner, so after this fill, they will lose me for good.
