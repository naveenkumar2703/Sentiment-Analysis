5	I've been buying from this place for several years now.  It's the closest thing to buying from the noodle factories in Chinatown in San Francisco  when I was growing up and traveling to from our home in the suburbs.Freshly made noodles from the manufacturer that makes noodles for many of the top restaurants on the Strip and surrounding areas.  There is a small office in front with a price list of the available products for sale.  They sell won ton skins chow mein noodles, and all of the other Asian mainstays for Asian cooking/recipes involving Asian pasta.  Just remember that this is a CASH only transaction type of place, and try to have enough exact change handy.  Some noodles are sold by the pound also, pre-packaged  or bulk.
