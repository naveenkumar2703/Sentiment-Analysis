4	Swan has been pressing my shirts for 10 years. Our family gets a discount that is well-deserved and we are always greeted by name. The hours have been decreased in recent months (no longer open Saturdays), which is inconvenient, but the family connection and reliable service trumps all. There are bigger, fancier dry cleaners within a mile of Swan but they'll never put a crease in my slacks.
5	Nice even closer!! New Location for Swan Cleaners located on North East corner in Sprouts shopping center!!  Fantastic service! You guys do awesome service!!
1	Dropped off my dry cleaning and when I went to pick it up they double charged my card (over $100.00). The person said they would have their manager fix it the next day and that they weren't allowed to fix it. She was very rude and hung up on me and then wouldn't answer the phone. The hours on their door and website say they close at 6pm but seem to close when they feel like it. (like 3pm) I would not recommend them to anyone.UPDATE: Just got off the phone with the owner. He apologized that his employees didn't know what they were doing but didn't offer to do anything besides correct the amount. Can't wait to see how soon they go out of business.
