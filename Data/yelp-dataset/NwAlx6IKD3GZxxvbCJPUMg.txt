5	Dr. Frank is personable, thoughtful, and thorough!  He has been our family's eye doctor for years, and we can't imagine seeing anyone else.  His staff at Estrella Eye Care is equally kind and helpful.
5	I had my first visit here last week and it was the best. I was worried about the outcome because I wasn't sure how good or bad my vision was. The assistant that completed all of my tests was very helpful. She was patient and thorough with explaining everything. The doctor, Beth, was very informative and helpful. I can tell she is passionate about her profession. I asked about bringing my children in and they gave me everything I needed to do so. They even made my appointment for me for a specialist I have to see. Everyone was super friendly and knowledgeable. I didn't have to get frames, but they also have a large selection of frames and contact lenses. It's like a one stop shop for your eyeballs.
4	Great eye specialists. They have a wide range of state-of-the-art equipment to keep your eyesight primo. The office is very relaxed and beautifully designed. The doctors could not be more friendly and helpful. Overall great experiences every time I have an appointment.
