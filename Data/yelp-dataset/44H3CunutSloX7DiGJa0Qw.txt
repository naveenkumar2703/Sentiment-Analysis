4	If you own a restaurant, or simply want kitchenware, Alida is the place for you. They are extremely reliable and trustworthy and offer the best prices and deals. Alida was originally Bigpan, so I have been a customer since Bigpan Operations. Since they have become Alida, I regularly rely on them for restaurant equipment and furniture.Not only is their equipment of the highest quality, the staff is always attentive, friendly, and helpful. Sometimes if you don't know what you're looking for, entering a store may be overwhelming, but their customer service is excellent. Right now they are helping me to reupholster my furniture. I love to come to Alida because they consistently take care of me as a loyal customer.There's no doubt about it--you need to stop by Alida Restaurant Supply!
5	Holy Restaurant Supply Batman! This place has it all. They have so much in stock and on hand it's incredible. Yes they are open to the public and have tons of dining furniture on hand to purchase in quantities small to large. I can't even begin to describe how cool this store was. I felt like I was on iron chef with the commercial grade equipment, and the staff was so awesome (even though I was purchasing a relatively small quantity of 4 to 6 dining room chairs). Highly recommend.
1	Poor customer service !!! Beware!!! True that they have everything but learn how to treat and talk to people! Or just be nice. Everyone makes mistakes and that's understandable. But never allow a customer to walk away upset at there dealings with you. Weather your right or wrong, You'll never know just how much business you could have earned ! Instead next time I'll just find someone else!
