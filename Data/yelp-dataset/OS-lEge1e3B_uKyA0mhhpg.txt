2	Every time I go here my burgers are swimming in grease. You unwrap the paper and theres a pool of it. Gross! This was my second time here. I figured I'd give them another shot. Nope. Same thing. 2 stars for the Frosty. That's it.
5	I was very impressed with this Wendy's! The interior was unlike any Wendy's I've been to. It is much more upscale and has a much more cafe like feel to it. My order was taken by what appeared to be the manager. She was very friendly and she involved the other staff in my order. They were all very friendly and prompt. I tried the Ranch Flatbread sandwich and a Caesar salad. The sandwich was a bit messy to way but tasted very good. I'm not in this part of town very often but I definitely recommend this location.
3	This is a nice looking Wendy's both on the outside and inside. Everything about the appearance is fresh and new and the little artificial fireplace is nice.Sadly the food is not any better than any other Wendy's and may even be a little less than average. It's OK for the price and when I feel like fast food I may opt for Wendy's, but in general I like to try to avoid it.
