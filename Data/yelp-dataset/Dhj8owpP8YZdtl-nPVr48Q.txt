4	We chose La Quinta because it was pet friendly. I am insane and take my dog wherever I can. And the prices were also reasonable. It's actually in the perfect spot, away from the strip, but not too far away. The room was clean and comfy. Bfast in the lobby. There were actually a lot of other pet owners here too, which made me feel a lil better knowing other people are just as crazy as I am to travel with your pet. Anyway, overall this place is a good choice. My only complaint would be the water pressure in the shower, it was nonexistent.
4	Pet-friendly! Anyone who has ever searched for a pet-friendly hotel near the strip, knows they don't really exist. This is about as close to the strip as you can get while accommodating a pet and it's actually quite close- just a $10 cab ride. But this location has another great benefit- a free-range dog boarding service (Camp Bow Wow) is right down the street! So while you're exploring Vegas during the day, poochie can play and get tuckered out (ensuring he'll sleep well in your room at night.)For the price, this place comes with a lot of unexpected amenities including a pool & breakfast. The staff was consistently friendly and helpful as well!
2	I usually like La Quinta but this one was not a great choice.  I don't think there are many people here.  There are only about 5 cars in the parking lot.  But the room is ok.  Not lovely like other La Quintas. I think La Quinta should reconsider this hotel.  It doesn't represent their brand At All.In specific, the TV isn't good.  A light bulb was burn't out.  The Coffee at breakfast was about 1/2 strength (that's just weird). and the closet hasn't been vacuumed in a long time.SIGH.So much for making reservations on line.
