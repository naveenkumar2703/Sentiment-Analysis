3	Leith Links, one of Edinburgh council's premier parks is situated in the heart of Leith, just near the bottom of Leith Walk. This green delight is squeezed between three streets, with large houses looking over the park on East Hermitage Place. The park is large and has numerous walkways cutting throughout. As I walked around it I noticed that this park provides space for many sports. It has a bowling green which is across from Duncan Place. Furthermore, it is home to the local amateur football team Leith Athletic (Unsure how good this team would be to watch and how good they are in comparison to local favourites Hibernian!). Also, the park has two children play areas, one with slightly larger slides and playing frames. The park was quite busy when I went for a visit to it, with it being very popular with joggers and young families. There are plenty of big green spaces to relax in the sun, however, in colder weather I would imagine this park, with being so close to the sea would be pretty cold at best!
4	Leith Links is north Edinburgh's answer to the Meadows, a beautiful and extensive green oasis criss-crossed with paths, dotted with playgrounds, and the perfect place for a stroll, a run, or to walk your dog.  It's actually much quieter than the Meadows and doesn't get overrun with picnicking students, making it a much more tranquil place to spend time (although the north east corner can get a bit whiffy due to the nearby sewage works).At the same time, the Links still have a lot going on, from allotments and a Children's Orchard located in their midst to visiting circuses.  The park also plays host to regular festivals such as the Leith Festival in June and the Edinburgh Mela in August.Another claim to fame is that, although no longer used as a golf course, it is the place where the rules were first laid down, making it officially the home of golf - take that St Andrews!
