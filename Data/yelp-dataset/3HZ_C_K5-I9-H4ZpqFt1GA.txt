5	I am now thoroughly convinced that Mr. Haan is the devil in disguise. I have always been a fan of this line and do ashamedly admit to the purchasing of his products on EBay. Yes, I can't help it. I can be a fashion whore at times. This shop is Cole Haan lovers dream come true. Clothes, shoes and bags galore and a discount section that doesn't fail to disappoint. With up to 50-60 % off you just can't complain. I think the sales staff thought I was a crazy person for buying a pair of boots and sweater during a 175 degree weather day, but hey, this girl will be looking fly come winter time! I will definitely be back to splurge here, the credit card will become maxed out, but I can't help it....the devil made me do it!
4	My mother and I came in here during the Christmas holiday so she could look at shoes. Cole Haan did not disappoint as she found a beautiful pair of shoes to wear, and I managed to find the perfect winter coat for my dog (don't ask). The customer service was great, despite the crowds for the holiday, we were not rushed or even made to feel as though we were a number. The lady who helped us (i forget her name) even made sure to include her card so if there were any problems or we wanted to order things, we could do so directly from her. Even though my mother's first choice of shoe was not in the store in her size, after some deliberation, her second favorite pair became the ideal pair....and if she's happy, then I'm happy.
5	Located in the Palazzo next to the "I Love Burgers" spot this is the only proper Cole Haan I'm aware of on the strip and with a location just down from Ferragamo the only 'problem' is deciding which store to stop in first.
5	It's the Cole Haan store - c'mon.My wife and I have like a dozen pairs of CH shoes between us, so yeah - we're brand loyal.  CH shoes are crazy comfortable.And the service in the store is top notch.
