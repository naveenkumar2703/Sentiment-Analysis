1	I have never experienced anything worse in my life. I submitted a request for a quote. I received the quote from Eric, sadly the owner.I replied to let him know it was a bit pricey for what I was looking for.Eric replied telling me I should take a bus and that I was cheap. Wow.
5	As a frequent business traveler, I have the opportunity to choose from many options when traveling.. When I am in and around the Phoenix area, I always choose McCarthy Car Service. The professionalism, courtesy and promptness of this service is really top notch. Each driver recognizes my busy schedule and always caters to all my needs. The token bottled waters with each ride are appreciated as well as the attentiveness of each call.I cannot recommend McCarthy Car Service highly enough to each of my colleagues traveling through the Phoenix area. Always on time, clean, professional and the utmost courtesy with each ride.
5	McCarthy Car Service is on time, professional and always willing to go anywhere. Have used McCarthy's for over 2 years and they have never been late. Strongly recommend McCarthys.
