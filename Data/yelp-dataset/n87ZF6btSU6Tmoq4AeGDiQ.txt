4	This was formally known as White Eagle, It has recently re-open under the name of Eddie's European Bistro. Wife and I was a fan of White Eagle, only problem was you never knew when it was going to be open? Place has been renovated, smaller dining room, but still enough room. Looks like the same people still works there, and the food seems to be the same! But looks like they now offer a wider menu. Again, we liked it before and will continue to come back!
3	Flavorful & hearty Polish food. Who knew that cabbage could be transformed into so many delicious dishes!  There is stuffed cabbage, cold red cabbage, cole slaw, borscht, sauerkraut and more.  Mashed potatoes are really good and the perfect side to grilled garlicky kielbasa.  Save room for a rum ball for dessert.
4	Good food but menu could use healthier options, better pricing, and a kids menu. Seems to cater to over 55 crowd. Kid friendly not so much-- except that my kid could scream and the polka music would drown it out.
1	This deli is right by our house. We had tried it before when it was White Eagle Deli. It was good food but the service was slow. Well we went back into this restaurant tonight..Friday night. We walked into the restaurant and were told to sit anywhere. We took a seat and about 5 minutes later the server brought us menus. After sitting there for awhile wondering if the server was going to at least take our drink order we started to get ansy. About 20 more minutes goes by and the server goes to the table next to us (who came in after us) to take their drink and food order. Finally we just said F-it...and got up and walked out. We will never ever go back to this place again. The service is terrible! Get the one girl in there doing everything some freakin' help!! Go to Archie's Deli down the way for good service and good food!
