5	Had a plumbing issue where we had a faucet from Chicago Faucets and an eyewash attachment from Bradley. The threading on the adapters weren't jiving with each other. I get advised that this place always has an answer to problems dealing with mismatching/odd thread patterns. If they don't have the right threading adapter, they can combine a few things to get what you need.The lady behind the counter seemed like she already knew what we wanted before even giving her the parts that needed to be connected. She knew exactly where to look to find the simple connector that we needed. Very professional and speedy was the type of service we got from this hardware store. This saved me a big headache from going through the two companies to try and find the right thread pattern to fit the two together. Great and professional service. EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!
5	So I'm not really the type that frequents hardware stores (despite the fact that I'm the current duchess of a Lowe's that I frequent near my home). I go to places like this with my boyfriend, who makes me.From a female perspective, I liked that this store was open on Saturday and that it had the strange size of bolt my beloved was looking for (apparently a very rare find in a big box hardware store like Lowe's and Home Depot). Not only that, it ran about $4 cheaper than the price of the 3 bolts we were looking to purchase at those other stores and he got a higher quality product.
5	Staff are helpful and they have items the chain stores don't carry. Great store.
