5	Love this place. Very helpful and always willing to help.
5	I love this place. I love the guys working there.  Very helpful and very honest.
5	It's a small shop but the amount of stock in the place is amazing.  They also did a very good job of organizing such a huge inventory into ways that you can see and touch everything.  I was expecting the usual stock of 2-3 choices of things, but I ended up spending a half hour poking through a dozen options on antennas for my Jeep.The staff offered to help as soon as I came in, but then let me browse unmolested when I said I wanted to look around.  When I was ready to ask questions I got a lot of help and good advice.  They really went out of the way to help, not just move me along.The prices are reasonable, not the absolute cheapest, but very good.  When you add in the personalized service and wide stock availability, it's a fantastic value.
4	This establishment caters to Armature Radio Operators (Ham Radio). their service and knowledge of the products they sell Is tremendous. The people that work there are helpful, not-pushy, friendly, and even willing to teach you a thing or two.When they're not busy this is a great place for new people to the hobby. When they're busy, however, they're busy. The best part about HRO is the guys.  They all seem super experienced and knowledgeable. The staff are a great help answering technical questions. CONCLUSION: Prices are a bit high compared to other Ham Radio stores HOWEVER If your into Ham Radios this is your ham heaven! This store has everything you might need.************************ What does my overall ratings mean *****************************5 stars -Highly recommended.
