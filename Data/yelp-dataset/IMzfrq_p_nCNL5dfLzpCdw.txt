5	First time - They asked if we had been there, guess the confussed look gave us away.  They brought sample cups; gave us a few samples each; walking us though the process. They were exceptionally nice and didn't make us feel like dummys. LOLGreat service! I got strawberry yogurt with fresh strawberrys and kiwi. SOO good!
4	Went here because we had a coupon for free 16oz so we gave it a try.  it was delicious.  staff was very friendly and let us sample as much as we wanted.  we tried the red velvet cake (which i recommend), pineapple, blueberry acai, lemon, vanilla, and orange.  didn't care too much for the orange, it was too bitter.  but the other flavor were magnificent.  the pineapple, blueberry, lemon and vanilla went really well together.they can expect us back soonDid i mention the plethora of toppings???  it's endless and delicious!
4	Good prices, love the pomogranite raspberry with no sugar added chocolate!
5	I absolutely love this place! I've never had anything but spectacular customer service and they have so many yummy and guilt free choices that we make this a monthly treat (sometimes twice) for the whole family.
1	*** UPDATE***Just had a glorious experience with U Swirl....that is sarcasm. I am a big fan of yogurt and so I have been going to u-swirl as it is close to my house. I drop about $30 every time I go (fam of 4). I have been saving up the stamp cards as I have done in the past with other yogurt places. I literally  have 4 full at this point. So I decide to use one tonight. I am the only one getting yogurt tonight so why not use a card. It says free 16oz yogurt with toppings. So I grabbed the small cup and got my usual. I go to check out and the kid says ok your total is $2.25 or something. I said Oh no I have a free one. He said right...we pay for up to 16 oz. I said...that's not what it says. He said that's how it is. before I could even finish asking him my husband had handed him our card to pay and he ran it. Literally seconds.It all finally settled on me and I was like No, this is wrong...I have spent $100"s of dollars here over just a few months. This is not how you treat your customers. The stamp cards are misleading. I have never experienced this with other yogurt shops. So I said...I don't want it. He said...you already paid for it. I said..refund. He said I can't, I don't know how. I said....that's not my problem. He was just like all the other workers at U-swirl (see below) Incredibly rude and unapologetic. You see...it's not us the pesky customers giving him a pay check every week. It's the money gods above. We are just the annoyance they have to deal with as we are such a bother. So he goes and get a shift leader. Not a manager (she made that quite clear). I explained everything and she processed the refund. She then took my yogurt. Oh and I had to ask for my punch card back. LOL. I thought I was in la la land. I couldn't believe what was happening. The WORST customer service I have experienced in a long time. I love how U-swirl thanks you for all your money spent. Yes...spend $100 and we will take of $2.00. Wow...oh and we will put a pretty bow of A-hole attitude on top. They would rather my yogurt sit and melt on the counter and upset a consistant customer than honor what is on the card?  I  hope that $2.25 was worth it. I know, I know, the frozen yogurt world has very little competition so of course you can treat your customers as you please. ;)Honestly, what it comes down to is they are misleading with the punch card. You should say up to 16oz free with toppings. Oh and a side note...my Mom lives in the neighborhood. When I told her she said they have never once charged her for her free yogurt and it has always been more than 16oz. So with all of that said...Starbucks got my money today and any other yogurt shop in the valley will get my money...u-swirl will no longer be cashing in from me, my family or my friends...and that's a lot of people. Good work team u-swirl! Friday  June 1st 2012 *******************************************************************************************Well I have moved and u-swirl is now my local fro yo spot. The yogurt is very good but the customer service is very bad so let me break it down for you. The location has plenty of seating inside and even a few tables outside which is nice. I'm not a fan of the setup as it gets backed up very easily but whatever...that will never change...so no biggie. My usual is cake batter with butterfinger pieces and shredded coconut on top. Yum! I also enjoy the banana but only when they have peanut butter. Bring back peanut butter! I wasn't a fan of the tart but I'm picky about my tart so I'm sure it's great. My husband only ever gets the tart so it must just be me. They have a great variety of toppings and everything is clean.I would honestly give this place 5 starts if it weren't for the people at the registers. I have never been to a yogurt shop where the people look at you like they want to kill you. It's incredibly uninviting and I feel like I'm bothering them by being there.  They do not smile, they do not say anything really other than put it down and you can take it off now...in such an annoyed tone. Stop  ruining fro yo night with your negative vibes. The last time I went in the girl at the register just stood there with a sour puss chatting it up with who I can only assume was a friend of hers. It's just weird that this is ok. Anyway..that is my only rant. Other than the employees it's pretty perfect.
2	Not exceptional but not everyone can't be Yogurtland. Service is good they have many toppings but the yogurt itself could be better. My least favorite yogurt so far
5	It tastes sooo good! I'm not a big fan of yogurt but this place is way better than most of the yogurt places I've been to. I had a chocolate/vanilla/cookies and cream yogurt with chocolate toppings and super good fudge syrup this afternoon and I can't wait to come back for more :)
4	I love this place. They always have great flavors that stay consistent with taste.  I have noticed many yogurt shops  have an icy flavor a few bites in but not U Swirl! They wonderful choices like Peanut Butter,  Oreo , Cake Batter , Peanut Butter  , Mint , Strawberry Cheesecake and of course Peanut Butter!  I highly recommend  this local gem.Located near major shopping and entertainment , this location is perfect for a snack when going to Target or Shopping  at Michaels. Service is great and they offer a punch card which means a freebie once in a while!
5	One of the best frozen Yogurt joints in the area. Good service, nice flavors, awesome colorful and soft seats inside and outside seating... Full candy and fruit bar with great extras. My usual spot.
5	My kids and I love this place!  It's got a modern but comfy decor, the place is always clean and they have a great selection of flavors and toppings.
3	What can you say, it's just some good yogurt. Nothing special, and nothing any worse than most. I mean, they are all pretty much the same these days. Only complaint....no need to hide the sample cups behind the counter....I have not been to one in a while that does this. Makes things complicated....I am already serving myself for pete sake!
4	One of the nicer self service ice cream shops in town. Watch how much you put in the cup because you pay per ounce.
5	I love that this place is open late! 11 on weekdays and midnight on weekends so you can catch a late movie and hit this spot if you don't want the night to be over yet. Delicious and they have a few healthy options as well as Options for restricted diets.
