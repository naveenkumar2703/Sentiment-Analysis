4	Tried this place only once, but then again...I don't live in Madison and just come to visit as often as possible :) The place opened up in April so they are still pretty new.  I asked if they had a restaurant too since most of the food stands do, but this is just food stand so if you like their food you'll have to get it there and then.  We shared the Tea braised pork and while it was pretty salty and left us satisfied again to definitely eat from this stand again. The dish came with a pretty large portion of white rise, cucumbers/celery and an egg. Everything was good, but everything (besides rice/salad) was also a little bit on the salty side. Too much non-sodium free soy sauce I believe. They also carry bubble tea, which I haven't tried.
