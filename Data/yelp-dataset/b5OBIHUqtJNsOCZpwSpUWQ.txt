1	2 large cokes for almost $5 !?!?Hell with you, czar of sirloin!  I'm going to McDonalds, Carl's Jr or QuikTrip from now on.
1	This place is absolutely disgusting. The workers here are terrible, and the service is so slow. The food is outrageously expensive, and you get terrible service and quality.
1	Disgusting. Ordered a double whopper which was inedible. I took about 4 bites cause I felt bad wasting it. But then I just had to throw it away cause I couldn't take it anymore. Don't bother visiting this location. Disgusting waste of money. Sad, cause I used to love the whopper.
