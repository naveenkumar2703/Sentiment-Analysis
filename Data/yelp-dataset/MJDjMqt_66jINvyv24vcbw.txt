5	scorpion motorsports is an awesome shop, great bunch of guys, especially the owner dino, they install a rough country suspension on my jeep for a great price and timely turn around will definitely do business with them in near futurethanks guys
5	Dino and the guys at scorpion have single handedly changed my opinion of off road shop. They are not only knowledgeable and friendly, but there is literally nothing they can't do. From bolt on to complete custom this is the place you should be coming. Ha coming
5	These guys really know what their doing here with all off-road vehicles. The owners keep things real and you don't get the vibe that they are there to rip you off when you're having technical problems with your vehicle. I would def recommend everyone to check this place out!
