2	i decided to give this place a second try i went to one of there stores right after they opened and was not impressed.finding good seafood in az is always a chalenge so i thought that f&e might be worth a try again but i was saddley mistaken on the shelf sat a few lonley packs of sea scallops and some  shrimp alot of hamburger and a few highly overpriced packs of lamb and a sh&^%t load of chicken. they seam to have alot of prepared food for people on the go or dont cook i think sprouts is a much better option
4	This is my favorite Fresh and Easy of the ones I've been.  It's rarely crowded and all the employees are super friendly.  I find their meat selection to be pretty good and the quality seems better than what I buy at Frys/Albertsons/Safeway.  The best thing I like about F&E are their branded grocery items.  Cheaper than the average store and better tasting.  I like that the store is small, easy in and easy out.  I hate having to deal with a huge supermarket when I only need a few things.  I just wish they had a bigger selection of paper products
