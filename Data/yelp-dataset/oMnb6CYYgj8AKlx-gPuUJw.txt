4	This place is way out of my zip code. I usually go to the Hallmark at Camelback Colonnade, and if I make it out there, Scottsdale Fashion Square, but I dig this place. Plus it's in the same ginormous shopping center as Genghis Grill!It's smaller than the one I usually go to, but I kinda like that, but let me share a tale with you. Picture it: the weekend before Christmas 2010. An insane, olive-skinned gay boy with a thick head of fabulous looking hair, who lives in Central Phx, hears about a great sale involving Snoopy and card at a Hallmark store. The store though happens to be this one and in Tempe, which feels like a million miles away. The olive-skinned gay boy braves the elements and heads to a packed shopping center and a packed store, and from the moment he enters, he's very impressed with the calm professionalism of the staff working in this Hallmark store. They're kind, courteous, helpful, and no matter how packed the store, staff members were easy to find in the case you needed that special card for the dogsitter. In the end, the olive-skinned gay purchases a lot of sale items, and tells the cashier he wants to make two purchases due to the two coupons he has. The cashier smiles and says, "Oh, let's make this easy, you can use both coupons for the one purchase!" Helpful and doing the best to make the purchase seamless and easy during a crazy holiday season? HECK YEAH! The olive-skinned gay boy is impressed and very satisfied, and decides that even though this Hallmark takes a light rail and two bus rides, it may be worth it.
4	A well-stocked Hallmark with friendly employees. I never have a problem picking out the perfect card when I'm at this store.
