1	UPDATE: ARCO / AM-PM IS OWNED BY BP AND SHOULD BE BOYCOTTED!!!=====================================================This review was written BEFORE the spill.---------------------------------------------------------What? Me (or anyone for that matter) reviewing an Arco AM-PM on Yelp?YES because people need to know what an inept place this is, and it's not the fault of the employees but THE OWNER!!I go in for some sodas and gas.The guy ahead of me at the counter apparently had $20 cash taken by the machine outside where you can either feed the kitty or pay with a card.The man just wants the problem fixed.It just so happens that the gal behind the counter is on the phone with the owner. OH YEAH. How convenient!! This NEVER happens. Man gets on the horn with the owner. I block out the conversation as she's now ringing me up for my gas and sodas.45 cent fee for using a card. PISS.WHO DOES THAT ANYMORE?!WHAT A CHINSE!!GET IT TOGETHER YOU CHEAP BASTARD AND FIX YOUR MACHINE TOO!!They might have the cheapest gas on the block but GO INSIDE WITH CASH IN HAND.Oh yeah and my Slim Jim had the texture of 3 years of age.CHINSE!!!
1	This store sells expired product and refuses to exchange or refund. Buyer beware!!!!
1	This was the worst customer service ever.....the owners son was extremely rude as disrespectful.....Will never go back!!!!
1	No working bathrooms. No bueno :(
1	I had been out Gaming @ Casino Arizona Indian Bend.  I needed gas on the way home. I put AMPM into my GPS and found this location. Their debit/credit card readers outside didn't work and the guy working (he SAID he was the owner's son) hassled me about using my card. I had to make multiple trips into the store to accomplish a simple fill up. Its not like I don't have cash in my pocket, but I make it a point of using my debit card for gasoline purchases as it is a business expense. I think this is the WORST AMPM I've ever been to and I quite simply will NOT go back there ever again.
1	Seriously a charge for using an debit card? Don't stop here....go across the street to the 7 eleven.
1	When I drove up and realized they didn't have pay at the pump, I was shocked. But then to find out they don't even take credit cards? How are you even in business? And your gas is $.10 more expensive then the shell one block down. Skip this place!
4	This is a difficult area in that pwople are begging and some people trying to get at the payment machines.I have never had a problem but appreciate lower priced good gas.Clerks are always friendly.
