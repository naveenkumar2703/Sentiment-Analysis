5	Been going to Dr. Stacey for years as well as my family members. His office staff as well as the Dr. are all wonderful!!
5	Excellent staff, super friendly, and very knowledgeable!
5	Very friendly service here--I started this review about a year ago and never finished it.  However, I now have another chance.  This morning, my wife awoke with pink eye and a frown on her face.  A call to The Eye Center and Dr. Stacy and they were able to squeeze my wife in on short notice.The infection wasn't too bad, and won't get any worse because he was able to get her a prescription for antibiotic eye drops.  Dr. Stacy has always given us great service and is my choice for eye care in the Valley.  I am eventually going to need new glasses one of these days and when the time comes, I'll be stopping by his office again.Five stars--enthusiastically recommended.
5	more than 5star for this eye center. i searched yelp for cheap eye center, i found some but this is the only cheaper but worth it eye center so far. i had a stye or chalazion on my right eyebrow, i also had this bump below my right eyebrow near the edge and a swelling as well. it gives me sharp pain every time i blink. and every time i wake up, there are this hard crusts on my eyebrows and at the end of my eye between my upper nose that was really annoying. dr. stacy is the one who checked my eye and he was very nice to me and his staff as well. i would definitely recommend this to all. fyi, i do not even have any insurance at all yet i only paid $ 69.00... great job!
