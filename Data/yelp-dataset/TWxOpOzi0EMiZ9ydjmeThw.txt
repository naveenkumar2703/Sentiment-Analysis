4	Get fuel here! Yay!
5	They have the BEST carwash I have ever used - only $7!!  I just arrived yesterday, driving 2,500 miles from VA Beach and this wash got it looking better than my old favorite back home.
1	DON'T USE THIS STATION!!!!! THEY PUT $126.00 CHARGE ON YOUR CREDIT CARD!!!!!!  I just got off the phone with them, as I thought someone had stolen my card when I saw my charge for $18.31 (I topped off my tank and bought a $7 car wash) and then another one for $126.00.  That's ridiculous!!!!!!!  This was NOT a debit card (I do understand putting a hold on those to make sure you don't spend the money before their charge goes through) but there is NO warning sign or anything.  I will NEVER go there again....my car won't even hold more than $50 worth of gas, and you'll have the actual charge as WELL as the $126 charge on there until they decide to take it off.  NEVER, NEVER AGAIN!!!!!  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me!
2	Please do something about the employees there! Constantly smoking right outside the door so you have to smell it when walking in. Never doing anything behind the counter when you walk in, but too busy counting cigarrettes or whatever to help you pay. Ridiculousy long conversations with customers, or friends in the store, oh, free drinks form the fountain too if you know them. Apparantly are trading discounts with the nearby sushi place too. INFURIATING!
