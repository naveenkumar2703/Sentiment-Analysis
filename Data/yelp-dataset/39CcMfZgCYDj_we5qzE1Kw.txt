5	If we are within a 30-mile radius, even for a few days, my husband get cleaning done here.  It's kind of ridiculous.  But they do a great job.  The prices are a little high, but I guess you get what you pay for.  I trust them with my cloths.  That is saying a lot.  I have tried other cleaners in the area and have regretted it as I cried over ruined items.
3	They always offer 50% off their services but even with the discount they are kind of expensive.  The first time I dropped off my dry cleaning I asked if they could have it ready the next day and they acted as if it was a huge chore and they would be doing me a favor.  The second time I went in they offered to have it ready by the next day. Um...ok.  My husband really does not like the way they press his shirts and we've gotten a few garments back that have a mysterious white residue on them.
5	Great place for dry-cleaning the staff is very friendless and the quality of the work is always good. The prices are great if you live in the neighborhood you get convenience and a price that is better than the competition.
5	I used Pat's when I lived in Scottsdale and they were great.  The location I was near had a drive through which made things very easy on the way home from work.
1	I was very surprised to call and ask a person if I could get an email with the pricing for this dry cleaner.  The lady that answered was nice but new and asked the owner that was by her the question and he said to her in the rudest voice I have ever heard, "JUST TELL HIM NO".  Unbelievable.  I spend about $200 per month on dry cleaning...
