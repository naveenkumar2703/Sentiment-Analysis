5	Dr. Mix is AMAZING!!!! I love taking my dogs to her. She is bright, energetic, and practices great medicine. I feel like I am at home when I take my dogs to see Dr. Mix. Tiffany, the Veterinary Technician, is so sweet and really compassionate. I would highly recommend Dr. Mix!!!!
5	Dr Mix is wonderful! She is a caring and practical vet. She is very good about explaining everything. I have been to vetinarians before that will try to get you to run every test and buy every pill by guilting you into it. Dr. Mix is very good about NOT doing that. She will suggest what she thinks is best, but won't try to do things that aren't necessary. Taking my dogs to this vet is out of my way now that I have moved, but I will not change my vet, I make the trip. The office staff and vet techs are all very good as well, very friendly and helpful. The prices are about average for vet visits, which isn't cheap as anyone with pets knows, but at least I am not paying for "extras" that I don't need.
5	Dr. Mix is the BEST.  My dog, Bear, loves her and all the employees as well.  She is so caring and has my dog in her best interest.  Bear loves to go there on vacation about 3 times as  they all spoil him.  It is like going to Grandma's.  Thanks Dr. Mix for being there and taking such good care of Bear.
