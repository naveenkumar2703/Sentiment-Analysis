5	Anna and Brandy were sent from up above to create the yummiest and prettiest baked goods in the universe!!!  They've made cake pops, cupcakes, and birthday cakes for me for the last three years, and I will NEVER use anyone else!  My daughter has a nut allergy and they're ALWAYS willing to accommodate her special needs.  Never again will she be left out because she can't have the same treats as her friends!  WE LOVE YOU, TCBS!!!!!
5	Brandy and the Tuff Cookie Team, I wanted give a BIG thank you for all of the hard work and coordination that was involved in making this cake.  It was so much better than I had envisioned!  Your cheerful, creative, professional and personal touch does not go unnoticed.We were all travelling form the Bay Area  and LA and did not have any means of bringing a cake with us.  I luckily found Tuff Cookie and could not have been more pleased.  I wanted to have this cake customly made and delivered to our hotel on the strip at a pre-designated time.  Not only was the cake there "on the dot" but the cake was marvellous!The entire party was in awe of the decadence and style of the cake.  Since we were staying in a hotel, they even helped to supply us with plastice ware, cake cutter/server and plates! Thanks again for making this milestone so memorable!You guys rock!
5	Tuff Cookie Bake Shop was amazing!  Planning a destination wedding left a lot of my vendor choices to internet research and phone calls... I couldn't have found a better bake shop for my grooms cake if I chose them in person.  I worked with Brandy over the phone and she nailed it.... one awesome 3D Angry Bird cake that had everyone at the reception smiling and licking their lips.   The price was reasonable, the delivery was prompt and the cake delicious.   I would feel more than comfortable recommending them to anyone that needs a custom cake in the Las Vegas area.
