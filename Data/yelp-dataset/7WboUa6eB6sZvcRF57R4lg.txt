3	Brand new Starbucks just off the Waverley Steps and it already is bringing in loads of custom. Figures! Shove a Starbucks somewhere and people will flock from all over. This Starbucks, although relatively new, acts like it's been running like a machine for a while now. The staff, like most baristas in Starbucks, are absolutely lovely and love having a chat whilst taking your payments or making your drinks. It's quite a spacious branch, with quite a lot of seating dotted all over the room, and plenty of plugs for charging your electrical equipment. Pretty decent Starbucks as Starbucks go!
4	Plenty of comfortable seating. A great place to grab a coffee and use the wifi to get your bearings while in town.
4	A nice place to stop before hitting the town, plenty if seats and staff to serve so your not left long in a Que. This store can be found near the top of the stairs as you are about to leave the Waverley train station.
4	This Starbucks always seems to be busy, probably because its at the train stations. But there are always seats and the baristas move fast here so I feel I don't wait very long for my drink, makes up for the line time. Great place to kill 30 or 40 min till ones train arrives.
4	Very good Starbucks, with very friendly staff who are great at remembering names and always pleasantly chatty. It can get quite busy at times, with the station being a short walk away - but there is usually some seating available. I've been very pleased with the quality of the coffees from here.
2	Awfull coffee. Hot water with a hint if coffee. Terrible music. Drafty. Well the wifi was free. I guess Starbucks is not my cup of ...
