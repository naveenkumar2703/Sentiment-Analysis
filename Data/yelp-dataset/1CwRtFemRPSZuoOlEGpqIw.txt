4	Just tried Orange Leaf tonight, I really liked the colors used in the decor so bright and sunny! They have some very unique flavors and a good assortment of toppings. This is a self serve location where you can  have it in a cup or also make your own smoothies all for only .39 an once so you can make it as affordable as you like. Fro-yo rocks !!!!
5	I think this is going to be my favorite fro-yo place.  I liked the decor and the large selection of flavors, they not only had PISTACHIO, but also Banana, my two favorite.  Also, the texture seemed to be creamier than others.   I liked that the seating is low and round, so I can bring the twins without too much worry about sharp corners.
5	I have been to lots of yogurt shops all around the Valley, and I think Orange Leaf is my favorite. It used to be Yogurt Builderz, but there are too many kids that run around that place. Orange Leaf has great yogurt and a nice selection of toppings. It is not too overwhelming. The yogurt is nice and creamy. I highly recommend.
4	Nice place and the yogurt was yummy.  I like that they had these big bottles of carmel and stuff next to the check-out... I added a little carmel before check-out.
