5	I really like the juice they carry. Moon Mountain is one of the brands they carry and it is awesome. They also have a cool retro Vegas feel to the store and great staff. I highly recommend the Nebula Nectar flavor.
5	Really cool place, the flavors are very good..not too sweet and overwhelming.. definitely lived up to the vegas theme .. try the orbital decay and earth is a blueberry
5	I stopped in today to talk to one of the owners Eddie and Daniel who worked there. These really are great people and a super nice shop! I love the Vegas feel and theme!!! I highly recommend checking these guys out!
5	I stopped in here a few times before to check them out and see what they have to offer. The first visit they were newly opened and they didn't have too much to offer other than Moon mountain Vapor Ejuice. Which I actually like a lot. Specifically Orbital Decay. After arriving recently, they have more mechanical devices and more juice.The staff are friendly and very warm welcoming. I like the theme of how Las Vapors is trying to portray, something like old Las Vegas. Wishing high hopes for this place, as once they really start going, they can end up a nice shop. Customer service is great. once you step inside you are acknowledged and they will help you the best they can. There's a sense of priority here, if you arrive and someone's being helped, you will wait (of course). But I don't know how many times i've walked in and waited then someone else walks in and they were helped before me. Don't think anyone likes that.Prices are average.5/5 for good customer service and products.
