5	Eye caramba!  Hidden in a semi deserted strip mall, is a taco place worth discovering. As I made a U turn on Decatur and meadows lane I saw this taco sign by the sidewalk and my car automatically pulled in into the parking lot and there it was! tucked away in the corner of the lonely shopping mall. Tacos Los tarascos..they may be hard to find but very easy to love. The place is clean, service is great and the food is very good as well, I had the classic tacos de asada, they carry all the basic tacos you find in all the other taco establishments but if you feel venturous you can also try tacos of.....ready?.. Head, cheek, tongue, lip, and the most Interesting.....eye tacos! You might want to look into this, they are guaranteed to please your taste buds. ( so I was told ) I was the only one at the place at the time but one other person that ordered to go, I was not really surprised since the place is kind of hard to see from the street, but I'm sure once people find out about it it should do OK.                                                                          All it needs is a little yelp from a friend.
2	With all due respect to the previous Yelper who gave this establishment five stars... I disagree, sir. I strongly, strongly disagree. I had just left Target when I saw their sign on Decatur and turned in. I was very much jonesing for some carne asada tacos, so I ordered a few of those and a burrito for my dad (I was on my way to his house). Yes, the place was empty and clean and service was ok, so no faults there. But what really got to me, and the big reason this place is two stars, is the following: when I ordered my asada, the guy pulled a tub of pre-cooked asada meat out and reheated it on the grill. That may be standard practice for fast-food places, but it's not what I expect from taco places. Not at all. I mean, making carne asada is the easiest thing ever: just grill up some flank meat, season it, cut it, put it on a tortilla. It's not like I asked you to bring me a space rock from the crab nebula, ok, so please don't re-heat my meat like you're saving all this time in a complicated process. No. The tacos themselves were ok -- ok in the way that you make yourself a grilled cheese at home and are ok with it. Flavor-wise, I would not return to this place. Re-heated carne asada wise, I advise you to stay away.
