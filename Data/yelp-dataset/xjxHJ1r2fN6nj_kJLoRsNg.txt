4	I came in for a quick checkup on some things and to have a mole removed before my health insurance gets downgraded next month. I had all my paperwork completed before hand, and I was rewarded with a less-than ten minute wait. The staff and doctor were very friendly and understanding. I got my procedure done and my prescriptions filled without any fuss or argument about what my needs were and how I felt about what was going on.Aside from having a chunk of my head cut off, it was actually a pretty pleasant experience. I would recommend Dr. Jeffries to others, certainly.
5	Dr. Thomas saved my life.  I just had surgery to remove a melanoma. I had three full skin checks by  both my surgeon and my family doctor and then by Dr. Thomas who was seeing me for the first time. She found a second melanoma, that the other two missed in the same week. She has been fabulous as a family dermatologist and in my opinion, 12 years ago, Dr. Thomas saved my life.
3	Dr Jeffries and staff are very polite. Getting medications is a ginormous hassle. They can get you in when you need to normally, but follow through is lacking.
