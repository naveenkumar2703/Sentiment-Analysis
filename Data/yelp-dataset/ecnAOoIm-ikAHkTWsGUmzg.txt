1	Save yourself the $52. Shady characters lingering around, people sitting outside in the parking lot and a mother half dressed w/ her son in tow (wearing a diaper and no shoes)@ 11pm was not the kind of welcome I expected in Phoenix.$2.99 wi-fi charge.Way better places to stay in the area.Room was clean. Staff was polite.Shady area, even a security guard is walking the grounds.
4	For under 45 dollars you cannot beat this place, the rooms are clean, the staff was nice, the location was off the freeway, there were a few other hotels but decided on staying in this one, it is close to a few restaurants and bars, and i think a shopping mall area, not too sure. Rooms were comfortable, showers were spacious and also clean. No complaints here at all. So if your need a good sleep and your near this place, give them a try.
1	this motel sucks!! never going to stay in thsi Arizona dumpe ever again.
