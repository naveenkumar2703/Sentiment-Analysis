5	The best breakfast burrito around, friendly staff, Joy (the owner) works there everyday
1	This is a tough review to write. On the one hand their cook is incredible! He's nice, remembers your order, and makes one of the best Breakfast Burritos in town! I would highly recommend getting the Bacon one and adding jalepenos. Also, if you go there for lunch and get one of their specials, it is very generica cafeteria food. Of the items served on their specials, typically one is pretty good, one is really bad (to the point you can't eat it), and one is mediocre. While the food passes the test for cheap quick food, what kills this place in the ratings is the cashier's ability to be unfriendly, almost all of the time. If you go there just once or twice, you wouldn't even notice it. But, if you go there most days of the week for breakfast, it starts to ruin the great breakfast burrito.I'll still eat here, but if anyone recommends anywhere else, count me in!
1	Joy the owner is always at the register and always treats you like shit. ALWAYS. She is always unpleasant, sometime muttering non-sense under her breath and it just plain rude. She is a freak of the highest degree. I work right across the street and finally I just decided I didn't want to support this troll.
3	Joy's Cafe closed down, but it re-opened as Gigi's Place. the food is still mediocre, but the cashier is much friendlier now!
