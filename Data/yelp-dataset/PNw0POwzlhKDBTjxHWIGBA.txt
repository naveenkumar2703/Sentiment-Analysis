4	Solid location. I recommend Nicky. She gets my haircut right every time. That's all I have to say really.
1	I wish I remembered her name, she was blonde, thin and had a deeper voice. she took my name and then sat down at her station to talk to her friend. Maybe she was on break. There was only one other stylist working. 15 min later she seats me and brushes my hair and snags my earring with her comb. THEN she asks me to take them off. She could have told me before she hurt me. She does a few snips and begins to talk with her friend that was sitting in the chair next to me and again; practically ignored me.  Second time here and I should've stuck with my initial gut feeling! Never again!
5	Consistently fast. As the expiration date got closer (1-2 days before expiration), it got really busy here. So if you have a coupon, use it well before the expiration date nears to avoid crowds. Also check in via phone app to save time. But, you still have to tell them when you arrive that you checked in online so they can mark you as present in the store.
