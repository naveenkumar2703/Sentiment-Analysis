5	This is the greatest source of gambling books in America, bar none. Everyone who is involved in gambling has spent time and money here. Truly unique. The shop is nothing to look at, and the neighborhood borders on being dangerous, and the hours are kinda short, but it's worth visiting if you gamble or you work in the gaming industry, or at least visit their mediocre website or subscribe to their great catalog.
5	This is a really cool indie book store specializing in all things gambling.  Really first rate selection, and worth a trip for the bibliophile in Vegas.
