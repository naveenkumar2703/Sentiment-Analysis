4	this has been reviewed by many as the best southern food stop in las vegas. i have been here dozens of times & even had them cater events for the company i work. mama's cookin is the best. the place may not look 5 stars, may not be in the best neighborhood for white yuppies to frequent, may not even look approachable from the outside but once you take that first bite. wham-zap-pow!!i usually go for the chopped bbq pork sandwich "the killer" with cole slaw on it. or i do the hot links platter which is 2 or 3 links diced in a sauce with red beans & white rice.the ribs are best in the summer when they have the outdoor smokers going and are catering alot of events,etc. the cornbread is insane-truly one of a kind. i stop by every now & then grab a "killer",red beans & rice and a drink for less than $10!!if you are looking for home cooking done right-big mama's is the place.Its a family run place so service is pretty casual and it is never very busy
1	I was lured with best of Las Vegas awards that your realize upon entering are from many years ago ('01 I believe).  The food was just bad.  My assumption is that Big Mama is no long involved in the food prep process, and someone with less caring and love is now in charge.  Everything from the ribs to the sides to the sweet potato pie were disappointing to say the least.  I wish I had gotten to try the food when Big Mama was still doing the cooking.  I'm sure it was good then.
4	great bbq.  all of the side dishes i have tried were excellent. it was something different.
4	Sorry to hear about the negative experiences at Big Mama's in LV. I live in Pasadena, CA and we have the 2nd location of Big Mama's here. While I don't give the decor high marks the food is quite good, especially the fried chicken (4 - 5 stars). The ribs are pretty delicious as well but I usually go to my local Honey Baked Ham store for those instead. If ever in Pasadena I suggest you give the Pasadena Big Mama's a try - 1453 North Lake Avenue.
