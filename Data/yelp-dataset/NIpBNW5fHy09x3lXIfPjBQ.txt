4	I've never stayed here but I've been here many times through work. We hold training courses here and the central location with parking is very popular with the delegates. Food is good here but when it comes to snacks with tea and coffee, its very hit or miss. Sometimes its lovely homebaking but sometimes its the usual bog standard biscuits in noisy packets. The Great Scots Hall is the most fancy function suite. It has a slate floor and large feature fire place. However its very cold in the winter and in the hight of the festival the busking pipers and music from the tartan tat shops make it hard to here a speaker. I'm sure if you were dancing at a wedding you wouldn't be too troubled. The building is lovely to look at and you wouldn't know it was only built in the 80's unless you look closely at the plaque outside. There are always taxis outside if you need one.
