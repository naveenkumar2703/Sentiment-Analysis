4	Great comedy club on Fremont st inside of the Four Queens Hotel. For the price we paid I had almost 1.5 hours of good laughs. Comedians Rickey Reyes and John Bizarre really cracked me up. They have different comedians every week though, so I guess it all depends on who is there for the week. I had a lot of good laughs and really recommend this club to anyone. Would definitely go back there myself to see more comedians performs.
5	I've been here quite a few times on trips to Las Vegas over the years. You can't beat LA Comedy Club at the Four Queens. For $35 you get all you can drink. That's a gift by any measure. Usually always a great show with a good headliner. Club is large and comfortable, if dated in decor. But then again what comedy club isn't? Unlike many of the clubs at home in New York, LA Comedy Club doesn't believe in maximizing profit at the expense of customer comfort and safety. In fact, their stated mission is to treat you like family and make sure you're happy and comfortable. No mashed together - tight as a jigsaw puzzle seating here folks. Just excellent service, a great show and extraordinary value, even for Las Vegas.This place is awesome and I always try to stop in when I'm in Vegas.
5	Saw the Mike Hammer show last night and had a GREAT time!! He kept the laughs coming continually, and was pretty interactive with the entire audience. Will definitely bring friends to see him again next time I'm in town!!
