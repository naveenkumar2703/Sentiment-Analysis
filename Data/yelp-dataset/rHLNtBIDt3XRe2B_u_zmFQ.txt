5	When did they open a 2nd store ???!!  I was at the pizza place next to them and I saw a same store that was in ft apache area. These guys are amazing. Ive been a customer at original store for few years.   If you have any computer problems including backing up and virus issues, you should visit.  They do not charge unless the issue is resolved and you get a free ink refill after the service. Anyways, I walked in there to say hi and ended up getting a free mail box for 3months!!  Im going to bring my friend to get a free mail box. The promotion just started so go get it.  You only pay $10 for key deposit.
5	Came here for a notary. Had around 4-5 documents. I think the total was around $10. Guy working here was very quick and efficient. Couldn't ask for more!
5	I would have to say that this will be the only place I would go to to get anything shipped out or any of my computer repairs. Tae is always a great help when I bring anything in. Store is very neat and clean and all staff are very friendly. I will be seeing them again shortly.
5	Tech Mail 2 offers everything you could want from a mail/computer repair shop! The gentleman that seems to always be working there is super helpful and accommodating when I am rushing around trying to FedEx or mail various proposals out all over the country to meet my deadlines. Also, they have all sorts of generously priced used and refurbished computers on display.
