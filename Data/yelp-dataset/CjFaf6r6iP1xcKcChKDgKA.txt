4	I will take Baja Fresh over that other place any time.Any time.This particular place is clean and friendly.I personally stick with the orignal Baja fish tacos.  There is something about their special tangy sauce that I really really like.I also get the express guacamole and chips - made fresh with no wierd additives.The chips are fresh made, I can tell, and I'm so glad they do this.Comfortable seating; an ideal place to have a quick meal.
