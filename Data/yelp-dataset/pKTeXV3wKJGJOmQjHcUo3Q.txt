5	I loved this place!It's true here some things cost more than they do IN Mexico.But, hey I got to save all that gas money or airfare by not having to cross the border. I bought plates here. As well as crosses for my hyper-religious family. All bases covered artfully and colorfully! Excellent!I'd definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the Phoenix area!
