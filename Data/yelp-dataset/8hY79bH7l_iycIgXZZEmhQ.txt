3	The food is very good, and there are infinite possibilities to how your wrap or salad can be prepared.  The build your own starts at a reasonable price but once you add any meat the price jumps to the $9 range (though you are getting a lot for your buck).  Another downside is they have no soda fountain, so you are forced to pace the 20oz drink of choice from the cooler...**UPDATE 3/25/07**I came by for a wrap after a long morning of traffic school, only to find this location is now closed.  Boooooooo!
2	Being a vegetarian, you'd think I would dig this place... but it's not so hot.  The toppings are mediocre, the dressing choices are not good and it's really expensive!  (Expect to spend around $10 for lunch and a drink.)For that kind of money I would much rather go to Sweet Tomatoes instead.
