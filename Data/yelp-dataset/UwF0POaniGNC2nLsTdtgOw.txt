4	Polite service. I got what i needed and was in & out in 3 minutes. I like it like that. No lines!
2	Definitely surprised that I didn't escalate as much as I should have.  Not really the best experience, but looking back, the employee was nice.I bought a few things online and noticed that it didn't work for me once I received it.  The receipt did allow me to take the items back to a physical store, however, when I got there, she wouldn't refund it back to my card.  I could only get a store credit.  I was a little turned off because I literally returned over $60 in merchandise.  That meant, I had to use that money back in CVS, a place I shop at about once every 3 years.  Definitely useless to me.  Like I said, the employee was really nice, which is why I didn't really escalate the situation.  I still don't prefer the policies that this company sets for their customers.
5	This is my favorite cvs location!!! All the employees there are very nice and friendly. They usually have all their items in stock if not they are happy to write you a raincheck for the deal currently going on.
