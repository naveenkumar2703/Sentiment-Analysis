2	So, I'm looking for a quick meal. And I thought to myself whats inexpensive, but the quality is pretty good, so Popeye's came to mind. I went to the closest Popeye's near UNLV. I will never go there again. To begin with, one of the staff persons was mopping the floor while food is being prepared, I am no health inspector but I think its a health hazard, it provided an unsafe environment for the worker who were all just wearing tennis shoes. Second, the cashier asked me if I wanted spicy or mild chicken, i told her mild. She said that I'd have to wait 15 minutes for the mild chicken, so I said fine just give me spicy. I also ordered an apple pie, which she forgot to give me, until I asked her for it and said she didn't put on the original reciept. Anyway, I am a fan of Popeye's but not this location.
