4	Place is pretty good its a gas station... 4 pumps next to a busy intersection... and also it has a small parking lot... other then that its a circle k
1	Stupidest layout of 4 measly broken down pumps.
3	I like the fancy walking beer cooler.
2	This circle k sucks. They always have some bullshit reason to be closed late night posted on the locked front door. And it so conveniently happens to be when I get off work at 2am. Clerks are slow and will chat with the person in front of you when there's a huge line behind them. Avoid circle k and go to QT
1	1 simple word go this Circle K. "Ghetto" horrible corner spot , homeless and drug addicts often come at night, pumps seem to never work !
