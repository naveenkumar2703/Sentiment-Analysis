5	We came here for a short stay 5 years ago and never really left. Palm Creek is our winter home. Facilities and grounds are all top.notch, but the real appeal is the residents who make all of the activities, sports and programs come alive.  Best Pickleball facilities anywhere with a dedicated club that teaches the sport and coordinates social and competitive games for all skill levels, every day of the week.  Hiking, tennis, golf, softball in first class venues. The community welcomes short term stay RVers as well as year round residents. This is NOT your average 55+ park model community!
4	Beautiful, meticulously maintained 55+ resort with too many activities to list. Staff are friendly, sites are huge, and it is a secure park with manned gate access. We found the majority of the folks here to be very active, with most folks in their 60's and early 70's. Also, there are 2,000+ sites here, so it is a mega park. The only negatives I would list are: it is on the expensive side especially during peak Winter season, the WiFi is terrible (even our Verizon MyFi Jetpack was slower than all get-out), and the "hot spot" areas listed in the park are slow as well. Lastly, there is a strong odor that has intermittently permeated the air here that blows in from cow farms in the adjacent town. It is either very stinky, or normal.
