5	Absolutely fantastic dining experience. Food was so fresh, tasty and immaculately presented. While the wine menu wasn't vastly extensive, each of the 3 bottles we got were very high quality and great vintages. Staff very knowledgable with the menu and attentive in their service. 7/8 staff front of house for such a small restaurant ensures you are well looked after. Booking is essential as we found it quite hard to get a decent time for a Sunday evening a few days prior. Like previous reviewer I am in shock that there are hardly any reviews for this place, given it has been here for over 3 years.
