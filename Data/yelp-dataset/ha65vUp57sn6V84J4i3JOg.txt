3	The Scotland T-Shirt Company has a whole host of tourist tat; Scotland magnets, postcards, See You Jimmy hats, Nessie hats and as the name suggests; lots and lots of t-shirts.The t-shirt say the kind of slogans you would expect such as; "I Love Scotland" and Scottish words such as "eejit" and "numpty" translated into the Queens English. I guess everything inside just makes for a bit of fun and if you're looking for Scottish souvenirs that are a bit daft then you'll find them here.
2	Specialising a bit more than normal for a trashy tourist shop, Scotland T Shirt Company is a company selling T shirts about Scotland.If you want people to know you've been to Scotland, with slogans like "I've been to Scotland", buy a T shirt here. This shop doesn't necessarily sell T Shirts that couldn't be bought elsewhere in other Scottish tourist shops, but it certainly sells more of them.If I felt the need to buy souvenir clothes in a foreign country then I think I would prefer something more specific (maybe from a famous landmark I enjoyed) or something tasteful (a piece with an emblem or an appropriate picture), not that all the T shirts here are slogan T Shirts, but most seem to be.Prices aren't outrageous for T shirts and have to remain competitive considering the sheer amount of competition, even just within a ten metre radius.
