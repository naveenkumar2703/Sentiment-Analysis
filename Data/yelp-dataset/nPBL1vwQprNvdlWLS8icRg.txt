2	You know, it seems almost silly to review a single fast food place. But what the heck - life is short, the time is now, and there's nothing to lose but patience.I'm torn on this place, which happens to be across the street from my office. The management seems very nice and friendly, and committed to good service. On the other hand, they seem to have some kind of climate control issue every time I come in. In the summer the food cooks itself, and in the winter you find yourself clinging to your icy beverage for warmth.Foodwise, it's a Jack in the Box. Not much more need be said.
3	Stood around for a few minutes before anyone came to the register. I'm not really that impatient, but it's still kind of annoying, especially when I'm the only customer in the place.
4	It's a chain. Drivethru was fast and got my order right, some can't do that. employee was pleasant and gave me enough napkins.
2	Went to this location one night to grab some food. The commercials and ads running at the time were for the $5 late night snack boxes. I went at night to grab one, and placed my order. The guy literally yelled at me telling me they didn't sell those anymore and got mad at me because I needed an extra minute to place my new order. I was treated so poorly that I just decided to leave and go somewhere else. I totally realize people have bad days and I was not expecting 5-star service. However, I should never have been yelled at for an honest mistake.
3	Store is kinda dirty...  But the store manager is the nicest guy ever!!!  I would come back again to eat if I was in the area and wanted these amazing tacos.
4	Why do people hate Jack so much. It is a fast food restaurant so don't expect some sort of 5 star food or service. Any of their locations have been quick and accurate when I have went.
