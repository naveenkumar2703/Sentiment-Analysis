2	Stopped in here because I was tired and didn't feel like driving to my favorite spot. It was a hot day and it was equally hot inside. Nail spas are supposed to be where you can relax, not sweat during a pedi. Aside from the warm atmosphere it wasn't busy and I was sat in a chair with hot water promptly. staff is ok...not great,  not bad. The work was decent. Would I return?  No.
1	I had to clean up my nails once I got home!  Had a gel manicure that was thrown on hastily resulting in gel adhering to my skin.  My pedicure was also lack luster.  Sloppy job.  I picked a lighter color this time and apparently the dark color I had on previously was not completely removed - you can see dots of dark color under the new polish.  Lastly, the owner is so caught up in getting paid in cash she asked me 3 times during my mani/pedi if I had cash on me.  I explained that I did have cash for the tip, but not the whole service.  She preceded to ask me how much cash I had on me.  Rude, not relaxing and I will not be back.
3	Service was great. Had a manicure and pedicure. They used all clean tools on me, and the pedicure included an extensive massage. Really nice if you're not in a super rush because they do take a lot of time to massage. Manicure was also well done. It did get busy around 3:30pm, seems to be a very popular spot.
5	New Owners!!  Great service, clean and professional. New name.  Vera's Nails. Give them a try. You will be pleasantly surprised!!
