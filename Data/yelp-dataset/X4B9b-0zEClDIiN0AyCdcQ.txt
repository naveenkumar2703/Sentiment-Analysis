3	Good overall chicken. Everything else was rather bland! Oh yeah, bring lunch to wait for your lunch too! Service took for eveeeeeeeeer!
5	I love Church's I wish there were more of them in town.  It took a little longer than what I'm use to (comparing it to another location) but it was awesome, it was hot, like it just came out of the fryer, the corn on the cobb was hot until the last bite.  This Churches, is small, and the tables are really close to each other, but other than that, no need in sweeting the small stuff, if everything else is awesome.
4	I was definitely stoked to try Church's. It's the closest chicken place to our house here in Vegas and I was hoping it would be great. It's your typical drive-through with far too many options on the menu. There was some bucket deal running, but my husband wanted strips, so we didn't opt for it. The chicken is fried, crispy and very moist. The flavors are delightful and it wasn't very greasy. I got a side of fried okra with mine and the serving was enormous. The okra was perfectly fried, not dried out - and made my mouth happy. :) My husband wasn't a huge fan - but he's super picky :)
5	My favorite place to get a bucket of fried chicken.   I like their coleslaw.   I would always order the mixed 10 pieces legs and thighs bucket chicken.   The customer service was excellent.   They always pack you extra napkins, ketchup & hot sauce packets in the bag.
