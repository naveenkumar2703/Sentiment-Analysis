4	Been frequenting ever since we moved to the neighborhood. Great , reasonably priced, fast take out, fresh flavorfull food that always satisfies. Plus, the kids love it. Thanks Beijing Beijing.
2	Oh my! Tried this place for the first time tonight - will not be going back. Egg drop soup - not good, egg rolls - not good, General's Chicken - worst I've ever had. The broccoli in the entree smelled bad, it was the first time I've ever had General's Chicken with a deep red coating on the chicken and no sauce. Heck - I didn't even get a fortune cookie - what kind of Chinese place is this. The prices were good compared to other Chinese places but it really doesn't matter if the food isn't any good.
2	Simply put...I've had better.  I ordered two meals with fried rice.  The rice contained hard pieces that were uneatable, yuck!  Crab ragoons had an imitation crab flavor and sadly to say, I think Panda Express does it better.
2	I dont know how this place stayed open. The last thing I ordered was horrible it was something simple that I figured couldn't be messed up: Chicken Fried Rice... the chicken was dark and hard, the taste was horrible. I tried the place again hoping for a better visit... not impressed.
2	Consistently disappointing. Best thing about this place is it is close. But the Yelp definition of  two stars describes it perfectly: "Meh. I've experienced better."Got the take-out every few weeks for a couple of years. Did I mention it was convenient? But it was never anything special. Didn't poison me, but was never exciting. Eventually made to switch to a place on Ray road, and have never been back to Beijing Beijing since. Hope you find this helpful.
