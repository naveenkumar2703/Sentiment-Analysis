3	This location has moved. The new location is just down the street in a bigger building. I like this place because they are a FedEx authorized ship center and I can drop my packages off here. Joe, the guy who is usually working up front is extremely nice too. The only thing that I didn't like was the amount of money they charge for boxes. I went in to buy a box and it was $7.80! A similar sized box at Walmart is less than $1. Granted, the box I bought was very sturdy, it still seemed like a steep price to pay for cardboard.
5	So surprised by the reviews -- we have used Pony Express to mail packages over 2 dozen times since 2013.   They have been absolutely wonderful - prepaid or not.  Always professional and prompt.
5	Very courteous and helpful. Made mailing my UPS and FedEx packages super easy. He even taped up my package for me free of charge. Stop at Target or the nearby Walgreens on your way if you want cheaper packaging. It's a business, you pay for convenience. Overall, a very positive experience.
