4	First things first, we all know that sunbeds are not good for you, but sometimes when my vitamin D levels are their lowest point and the dreich Scottish weather is getting me down I pop into Indigo Sun for a 6 minute blast of UV joy. I know it's not big or clever, but sometimes it just has to be done. The shop is pretty large and there are plenty of beds, so you never have to wait very long for your moment of shame. The beds are well maintained and always clean, plus there's anti-bac spray if you're concerned about hygiene. The prices are reasonable and the staff will advise you on the large range of creams on display to help you reach your optimum bronzed state. Probably best not to get into the habit of visiting, but if you only do it occasionally I doubt you'll come to much harm.

But unfortunately for me I was 'blessed' with skin that makes Snow White look tanned and so before a dress-wearing occasion I have been known to get a little help.The salon was very clean when my friend and I walked in, and it smelled really nice although it was absolutely BOILING. It was as if they were trying to kid your brain into thinking that you were in fact on holiday, so that'd you'd tan faster. All it did was make me irritated and grumpy.That lost this place it's first star. The second I took off because of the staff. When we walked in there were two girls behind the counter and another girl draped over the counter chatting to them. They stopped taling abruptly when we walked in, but all three of them stared us up and down disapprovingly, without even trying to be subtle, before looking at eachother with a puzzled expression on their faces. In short, if you're a radioactive ahde of neon rom using sunbeds too much, get yourself to this place and you'll fit right. If not, you'll be gawped at like a circus freak.
