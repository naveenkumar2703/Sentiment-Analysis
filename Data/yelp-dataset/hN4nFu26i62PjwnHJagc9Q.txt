3	I had to come here, it's a West Coast tradition right? I was more excited to visit Phoenix for the food than to go to the Blackhawks vs. Coyotes game. I was biased based on my In-N-Out Burger experience, it has been on my wish list for YEARS. We passed a Jack-In-the Box and figured why not? This place is kind of like a Wendy's mated with a McDonald's but with the quality of a Burger King. There are a decent amount of options, enough to please even the pickiest of eaters (or someone who just has no idea what they want, story of my life). I went with just a plain chicken sandwich, after maxing on In-N-Out Animal Style can you really blame me? It was good, consistent, and not too greasy. The fries weren't mushy, which I appreciate. Nothing is worse that a gushy, mushy fry. On the way to the airport, this place was the perfect stop. The service was fast and efficient. I'm not sure if I would make the conscious decision to eat here again, but I'll try anything once!
