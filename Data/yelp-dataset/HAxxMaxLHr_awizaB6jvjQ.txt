5	I have tried a few doggie grooming places here in Vegas  for my pomeranian and so far this is the best place.   They cut my dog's hair exactly the way I asked for; and the people are friendly there and the service was fast.  The entire wash and cut cost $35 and it was definitely worth it!  They have a lot of customers on Sat. so be sure to make an appointment.
4	I would have given these ladies a 5 star review but I know that Yelp hides those.  Anyhow, these ladies did a great job on my mini schnauzer, Max! You can't beat the job they did and it was fast!  Max is happy and that makes me very happy!  Thanks Doggies Delight!!  We will be back for sure!
4	I go here to get my dogs nails trimmed , she's deaf and very figgity.. But she loves this place, the ladies are very sweet
4	Location: 5 stars! It is very easy to get here from almost every side of town because it is close to the Highway & Dessert Inn. Staff: Very friendly and trustworthy. Service: They are great for both last minute bookings and appointments. If you are hoping for same day doggie service, I would call before 10am because they keep very busy. Quality of work: I have 3 dogs and they always look adorable after they work on my babies. They do take their time with your dog so I would expect at least an hour or two after your appointment time per dog for pickup. Cons: They only take cash which isnt only ideal & I feel their prices for large dogs are a little too high.
