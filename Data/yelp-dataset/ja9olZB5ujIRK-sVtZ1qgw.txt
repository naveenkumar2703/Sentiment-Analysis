4	Swung in on Monday morning and as always timed it perfectly!  Walked in, sat down, had what little hair I have cut and left.  Very quick and painless.
4	I take my children to Great Clips.  On this particular visit, we arrived around 8pm, and were informed of a short wait.  We waited about 10 minutes before the first daughter was called back for her wash and cut.Within another 10 minutes, the other daughter went back.  Both were given personalized attention and enjoyed the scalp massage with the shampoo.Both haircuts came out fine, symmetrical, etc.  Friendly and efficient hair cutters.  Price for 2 cuts, including shampoo and tip:  $34.00  ~~ and the girls were happy with the results.We will return to this location.
1	Non-existent customer service. Quite literally. I walk up to the desk, the guy working there ignores up - I'm standing at the counter inches from where he just finished ringing up a customer - when I get to the counter, he turns away from me and walks away. Walks. Away. From. A. Customer. Like I have cooties or  something. WTF? I'll go elsewhere for my haircut.
2	Not so GREAT Clip.... from my experience.  I'm not going to write a book about it, but the service is okay, the workers are disgruntled (bad ownership from what they said), but my BIGGEST pet-peeve, the stations are covered with hair and they didn't clean up prior to me being seated.  I had to ask her to clean up.
2	I called this location to see what their wait time was and the woman who answered, Angie, informed me that there was no one there and to come in. I asked to put my name in and she stayed that it wasn't necessary. I asked her again and she insisted that I didn't need to. I drove the 4 minute drive from my location to this great clips and when I arrived every seat was full and there was a 35 minute wait. I mentioned that I had just spoke with someone and asked to put my name in and every person acted oblivious. No apology whatsoever, horrible customer service.
