2	The location is good which is near the Stratosphere. But the room was ghetto as hell. Money shots all over the floor, holes in box springs, trash and crumbs under the bed, roaches running away in the bathroom. The decor was filthy and paint was pretty funny to look at. Looks like they hired a drunk bum to paint the walls. The peephole in the door was just a hole. A/C was falling apart but worked. The swimming pool was filled with concrete.. Towels had stains on them.No blankets just a sheet. I couldn't even sleep there, I though some slime was gonna come alive or be attacked by bed bugs or momma roach.=GHETTO but not too ghetto since its pretty quiet there...
2	Hole in the wall but somewhere  to fall asleep. It's down the street from the strip so as you can imagine the freak show you get to watch. It's in a very busy place.
3	I stayed here a few times when I was in Vegas in the late 90's. The guys who ran the hotel were very nice! The room itself was fine. It was a place to sleep. Next door was an adult shop that sold smokes as well. Keep in mind that anywhere near the Stratosphere is sketchy. Granted, the motel could use some work, but it was fairly priced and worked out well.
