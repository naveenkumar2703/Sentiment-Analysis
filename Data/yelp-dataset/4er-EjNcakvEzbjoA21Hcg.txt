5	Tempe Bicycles hooked it up for my 18 year old Giant Iguana mountain bike. I took it in with a variety of mild maladies, and 20 minutes of adjustments, lubrication, and tightening later it was riding like new; it cost 10 bucks. They didn't try to sell me anything, replace anything, or push for additional work...they just fixed everything I told them was acting up. (And, I also gotta say, Giant makes pretty good bikes, or at least they did 18 years ago. I've only replaced the chain, the saddle, and the shifters in all those years. Everything else is original and solid.)This is a small shop with limited variety, but they had a little bit of everything, including a decent BMX selection (which I've found to be pretty rare). And, they're friendly and prices seemed fair on everything I looked at. Most importantly, they know their way around bikes. They have a reportedly bigger shop on University. If I were buying a bike, I'd definitely give them a look.
5	I bought a bike and was very happy with the price and all the help that went with it.
5	Very happy with this place! This is the place to buy a bike. Don't go to the location at Rural and University, their service sucks to say the least. This location on Apache was not the case. The staff really listened to what I was wanting in a bike and didn't try to upsell me on anything I wasn't interested in. They were also very knowledgeable. I have to say I love my new bike they sold me so much that I ride it more than I thought I would. I take it everywhere. I also got a great price for it too. This is definitely the place to go to buy a bike or even get maintenance done.
4	Just bought a new bike for college son. Employee who helped us was on his first day. Very good service.
