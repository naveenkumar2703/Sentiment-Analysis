4	The people are nice and the place is nice.
5	Girls are sweet and prices are reasonable. The stand up bed is hot so make sure you adjust your time ( I might just be super white lol)
1	I created a Yelp account just to be able to review this place! I'd give them 0 stars if I could. Worst customer service ever. Ever! The front desk girl kept asking if people could go in front of me because she saw a weird balance on my account. Twenty minutes later she decides to help me and then someone else walks in the door and she puts them in front of me AGAIN "because we have a complicated situation". I cancelled my membership months ago because every time I went they couldn't find me in the computer. Which made sense when I found out the front desk girl spelled Megan, "Meaghin"?! I've never seen it spelled that way in 27 years! So, I handed her my photo ID after spelling the 5 letter word a dozen times and the bimbo puts it under my middle name so now I have had two accounts for the last few months and no one can figure out how to merge them or close one? So now I have an unpaid balance mysteriously today from back in May and she can see all of my notes that I have been comped tans and upgrades for my next visit  because of the frustrations I have endured and continue to come back because of the location. And then she still demands there is nothing she can do and I must pay the $10 and back dues and then activate a new account? Whaaaat!!? Yeah, I think all their brains are fried. I regret even trying to give this place a second chance just because they are walking distance from my house. From now on it looks like I will be driving for my tanning to anywhere but Celebrity Tanning!
