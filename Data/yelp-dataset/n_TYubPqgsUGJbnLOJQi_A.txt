5	Dr Brown was great. Friendly and helpful. Explained everything and even threw in a little podiatrist humor! His staff was great too. My foot is so much better. Will be going back.
4	Dr. Mayben and staff are very friendly and nice. I would recommend them to anyone. Mayben performed surgery on my foot, and it feels much better. The follow up and aftercare from Mayben and staff has been wonderful. Very professional yet very casual and laidback at the same time.
1	I went to Dr Maebin because dr. Brown was on a leave of absence. After some research online decided not to ever go back. Dr. Marvin was very nice and seemed knowledgeable but didn't trust someone that would work with Dr Brown. Do your research!!
