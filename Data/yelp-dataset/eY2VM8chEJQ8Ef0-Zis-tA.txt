5	While searching for new carpet we stopped here to check out the choices and prices. Huge showroom. So many choices of flooring. I wish I could have hardwood, too many rules in my condo HOA. :(I knew I wanted a medium dark gray carpet. I found the perfect color, great padding, you have to have good padding. And best of all a great price. The Salesman David was great. Did not try to oversell or push anything on us. He came to our place to measure. The carpet was installed 2 weeks later and it is fabulous. George and his team did a fantastic job on the installation.  Professional and neat. Should I need flooring again, this is where I will be going.
5	We have had dealings with Cloud Carpet for years and I have to say that there is old fashioned customer service there.  If you want people who really care, you can find it at Cloud Carpet.  I have to agree with the previous reviewer.  Dave and George are great. I recommend them to everyone.
5	We had used Cloud Carpet One before for our carpet, so returned to have them replace the tile in our home. The finished product looked great and my wife is happy! Cheers! We used the branch on Lake Mead and Buffalo. If you are looking for new flooring, give Doug Willbanks a call 702.631.2850. A professional and is as concerned about you as much as he is concerned about your floors.
