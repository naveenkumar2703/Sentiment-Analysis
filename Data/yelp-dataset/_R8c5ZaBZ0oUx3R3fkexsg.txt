4	OOOH!!!! AX bikini's for only 9.99!?!? If only I didn't eat at a buffet the night before...I love shopping at this location. I found some cute pleated skirts and tops for 19.99 a piece before. Dig around on the sales racks; there's definitely great finds in there. The downside is that a lot of their merchandise is damaged from size 10 people trying to squeeze into something that's a size 2... take the time to check all the seams before you purchase!!
3	love the selection
4	Great outlet boutique with everything from Armani Jeans to Armani Collection and Emporio Armani...it's a bit of a small store so you have to be patient while going through all options.
1	Very good selection and great prices. That's about it ! Has to have the worst customer service. The staff is downright rude ignorant and dumb. I had to ask the service guest if they could let me see different jackets from the isle as she did not want any customers to bother her during her re arraigning just a handful of jackets. So I decided to check something else and voila she left her jacket isle halfway and came to the very section I was in again not to help but rearrange. I guess her customer skills were awesome in turning people away.
