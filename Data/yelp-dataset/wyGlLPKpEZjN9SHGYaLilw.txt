5	Cool chill hangout!
3	A nicer Double Down Saloon (including vending machine) and the bathroom doors actually lock! Don't order well drinks- I'm pretty sure they're all moonshine.The bartender was very nice and way too good looking for a cash only bar (ATM inside) with an average patron age of 55. Diamond pool tables are available for sharks.Don't be discouraged by the boarded up window on the front door- it's open.
3	I would classify this bar as an upscale dive.I have a couple of friends that are regulars (like 5-7 days a week regulars) and everyone knows everyone here.  It's easy to see why they like it.  There's always a pool game, drinks are cheap and the bartenders are very friendly.A couple of negatives would be that they don't serve food but it looks like most just get something from Thai BBQ next door.  They also allow smoking and don't have an HD signal for their games on TV.  I talked to one patron that's been coming to the Front Row since 1986.  I asked him if anything at the bar had changed since then and he said "nothing".  It definitely feels like a cool basement from the 80's.  As Marie L mentioned in her review, the average age of the patrons is 55+.  The bartender pulled out some random beers just sitting in their fridge for me to try.  A bunch of interesting choices I'd never heard of.  I enjoyed a couple of stouts that I don't remember the names of.  But in the end, I still prefer Jackson's just up the street due to food, drinks and better quality TV's.
5	Very cool place. Great drinks and atmosphere. The bartenders are all super cool especially the graveyard guy he's hilarious and makes every night fun.
