2	Taco Bell is Taco Bell...
3	God, I'm reviewing Taco Bell.My husband picked me up a nachos bel grande, I think it's the fanciest nacho they have on the menu (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).By fancy I mean meat (I wonder if they're still using pink slime meat), beans, nacho cheese, tomatoes and sour cream shlopped on a handful of chips.Why are you rating TB's nachos you ask? They frickin loaded this sucker with toppings. Seriously loaded it so much that I had more shlop than chips. Usually you have to take a plain chip and steal the toppings from another chip, in the end the original chip with toppings is nothing but a soggy floppy chip.Not this nacho bel grande, not this Taco Bell.GO TB!
3	How do you review Taco Bell? They are all pretty much the same. I come here for lunch sometimes and it's ok. The location is in a high traffic area. The thing that bugs me is they serve ice tea, but no lemons just limes...really just limes?
5	Everyone knows Taco Bell and their food, this review is for their employees. This store has the best employees. Doesn't matter what time of the day or late night, the employees are friendly, professional and efficient. The younger kids are respectful and professional too. This Taco Bell hires right.
2	I thought the whole point of taco bell is its open late. Not 11pm, or a few minutes before. Boo
