The staff handled the massive amount of people with Speed, accuracy and a smile to boot!! Stephanie did an awesome job navigating my SIX confusing drink orders! A big thank to the Starbucks crew for such a great job under such pressure on Christmas Day !!!!
1	Has to be the absolute slowest Starbucks I've ever been to... One lady goes back and forth like she can't think of what to do next... They carry on personal conversations instead of focusing on getting drinks out... Watching people standing in line and looking at their faces looks like a bunch of zombies...but what can you do when their isn't another one to go to??
5	I love visiting this Starbucks location! :) It's one of my favorites to visit. The team is always super friendly, personable and always makes my orders correctly. When our office has placed large orders, they always have things organized and get our orders ready quickly. They go the extra step to help me carry all the drinks out to my car and I so appreciate them. :) Best Starbucks team in the east valley!
