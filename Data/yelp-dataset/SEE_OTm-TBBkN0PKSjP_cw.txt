4	OK, nobody likes paying taxes, but it's one of our duties as responsible Americans to pay our fair share (I'm looking at you, Republicans and 1%ers). So you may as well do what it takes to make it as minimally painful as possible.This H & R Block location is not in a great part of town, on the corner of Twain and Maryland Parkway. There are many other places in Vegas I'd rather be... like, pretty much anywhere. And some of the clientele here make rednecks from the Ozarks look like Hollywood socialites.So why do I give this place 4 stars? Her name is Susan Ettinger. Best lady in that office. This is my second year working with her, and her pleasant, helpful attitude helps you forget the fact that you're being squeezed dry by politicians yearly. Well, maybe not forget. But it makes it more bearable.Also, H&R Block locations usually do a "Free 1040EZ filing" promotion for the first few months of tax season, so you can have professional eyes looking at your taxes, and not bumble around on some internet program and hope you get it right.
5	When you go to this H&R Block, and you most undoubtedly should if your return is going to be even marginally complicated, seek out Robin Michelin. She's been doing this for 30 years, and she found deductions I didn't think I could take. She almost DOUBLED my anticipated refund with her diligent effort and sleuthing. She's definitely a reason to get your taxes done here.
4	Well at first look it looked like turbo tax was my better option. I had come up with the same result as my tax professional. I owed $ booooo! After sitting there and making her some what feel bad she reworked some stuff for my schooling and what not and I ended up with $ back. Yay! It's pricey 118$ for taxes with education included. Um Student Discounts don't apply?! I kinda bitched about the price and she found me a 25$ off coupon so it ended up being $93. Ok not turbo tax free but at least I got some $ coming back now. I'd recommend them.
