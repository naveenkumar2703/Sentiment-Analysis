1	RUDE! Seriously, this place is near my house so I called for an oil change and the guy said he could do it right then, so I drive down there and go inside... The guy behind the counter was nothing but rude. He looked at me like I must be stupid since I'm a girl of course, then spoke to me like a jerk father would scold his 5 year old son. They also do not offer synthetic oil... oh but if you bring in your own they'll use it. Lame! I was so irritated I walked out. I'll drive a little further for some good service, thanks!
4	Went in today for a set of tires.The price was close to other shops i went to. The people i dealt with where fine, they put on the tires, i paid. people today expect shops to bend over backwards for them, not going to happen. as they say it is what it is. if i needed tires i would go back.
5	very satisfied with them
5	Absolutely the VERY BEST Apache Junction has to offer.  I have to recommend this place to all my new neighbors, because having a car serviced or buying a used car can be a scary experience especially if you do not know who you are dealing with?  I cannot tell you how HONEST and PROFESSIONAL the staff both sales and mechanical are at James Tire Warehouse.  These people are a blessing their prices are more then fair, they stand behind all their work, and most importantly THEY TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS WITH RESPECT!  I highly recommend this place to everyone I will not take my vehicles anywhere else.  God Bless.
