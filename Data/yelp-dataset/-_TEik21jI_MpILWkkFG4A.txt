5	This service is the absolute best! I have had two other pool services and they cannot touch Mr. De La Rosa and his crew. They periodically clean my pool filter as part of the regular service (another service I used charged me $25 extra and insisted that I pay them before they left). I had a problem with my pool pump and De La Rosa replaced the impeller at a reasonable cost (how many pool services would do that?). I get friendly, courteous, reliable service at a good price.I live in Centennial Hills, so I know that this company serves the northwest side. I'm not sure about other areas - you would have to call them.
5	He is great. Super friendly, does a great job and very reasonably priced.. As a new home owner he is helping me understand how my pool equipment works. I highly recommend Benito.
5	We had an awesome pool man that we really enjoyed, but he passed away out of the blue and I didn't think we were ever going to find anyone as good as he was.  I let the pool go for months without being cleaned.  It was DARK green and getting worse.   I called up Mr. De La Rosa and he was able to come out and do a consultation that day!  In two days our pool was back to crystal blue. I also hired him for a weekly pool cleaning service.  I don't even need to worry about our pool any more because it has been perfect ever since. Mr. De La Rosa is professional, knowledgeable, and his prices are competitive.   I would definitely recommend him to anyone.
5	I was concerned with my current pool service and I called De La Rosa Pool Service to see if the could troubleshoot and give a consultation. Not only did Mr. De La Rosa come out on the same day, he helped me figure out my problem and taught me how to fix it without charging me for the consultation. Mr. De La Rosa runs an honest business and would do anything for his customers. I highly recommend his pool service!
