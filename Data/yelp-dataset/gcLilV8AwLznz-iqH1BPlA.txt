5	The instructors are the best.The studio is clean and beautiful.My family and I are having a great time.Thanks America's Best.
5	The instructors are very knowledgeable.The children learn not only to defend themselves, but to be respectful.They teach more than karate, they teach self confidence, and respect.This is a place you need to at least try out, you owe that to your children.As a proud father, I can not think of a better place for my sons to learn respect and Confidence.
3	My biggest complaint is how filthy this place is inside!  Gross, get a cleaning lady to detox the place and have one come at least monthly!  The front desk is covered in dust and the bathrooms are plain nasty.   Instructors are nice and knowledgable.  I just hope they can get the place organized and clean.
