4	They serve breakfast all day!What a plus, especially if you overslept and missed the cut off time for breakfast (10:30am).  We're on our way out and headed back home to Cali.  We wanted something light and enough to get us through for a few hours on the road.  A small and light breakfast was prefect at the time and we are glad they served them all day.This place was just located a couple miles away from the Las Vegas Strip right on the main boulevard itself.  Food         =     B+Service     =     ADecor        =     B
4	As young as the kid is behind the counter, he is so damn polite!Its the JITB that has the typical Vegas neon (or these day LeD) lights to add to that Vegas feel.
4	JACK, WHAT WOULD ALL THE DRUNK AND HIGH PEOPLE DO WITHOUT YOU AT 2 IN THE MORNING?That includes me because when you dont have much money and you're starving, 2 bucks for 4 tacos goes a long way!This place is at what I think is at a nice location. It's at the beginning (or ending, whichever way you look at it) of the strip. Right next to them is a 24 hour gas station. Im sure hundreds of you that are reading this have made a stop here one time or another whether you were gassing up or just wanted to save money because of the expensive buffets the past couple of outings.Service is decent about 80 percent of the time. A couple times I have done the drive through and it took forever to get my food. No, there wasnt a long line and it was at two different times of the day. Foodwise, everybody knows that their 2 for 99 cent tacos are what makes them a good choice. That and the fact that you can order ANYTHING off their menu is a huge plus. It's 8 in the mornig. Want a jumbo jack? Sure! 6 pm dinner time? How bout some mini pancakes? Ok!So Jack, if you're reading this, dont change a thing! Oh, also don't stop making those funny commercials!
4	Who doesn't enjoy having breakfast for dinner? Brinner! I love that Jack in the Box serves breakfast all day long. I tend to pass by this Jack in the Box on the way home and it's right next to a gas station, nothing else really near it until you hit Town Square. I usually use the drive-thru and there is either no line or only a few cars ahead of me. I like that because I have places to go, brinner to eat.It's a Jack in the Box, so if you're not into their food, you're not going to like it at any location. I happen to like an occasional meal at Jack in the Box and this is the closest one to me. The employees are fast, friendly, and the food is Jack in the Box delicious, so I can't complain.
