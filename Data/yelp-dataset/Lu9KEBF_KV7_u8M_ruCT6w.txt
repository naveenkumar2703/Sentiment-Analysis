5	They have the pest services with a good Price , I will never go to any anther place :)
5	My camry's ac locked up for the final time... Billy quoted me $400 less than the Toyota dealership, and stuck true to his word. They have amazing service and were willing to work around my schedule, even offering to give me a ride to work from the shops and pick me after my car was done being serviced.I will definitely be going back there for any major services. Plus, they have two sweet 80's Ferraris (a la Christy Brinkley), massage chairs, and a bench press in their waiting room. Something for everyone....
5	Billy has always been awesome to work with and works around our busy schedule. Its important to find a great mechanic when moving to a new city and these guys are it. They have never overcharged me or tried to sell me something I didn't need.The guys at Fayad always take great care of us and our cars.We take the problem-prone Range Rover (POS) there and saved hundreds less than the dealership. Not saying the RR is cured of its demons, but it is running. :) These guys fix everything from a Ford to a $150k BMW. They are knowledgeable in just about every car. Give them a shot, they will not disappoint!
5	Great service at a great price, billy is the man. Always around 50 percent less than what dealership charges!
5	I stopped in for an oil change a few weeks back because of the yelp reviews. I was not disappointed! Great service at fair prices. The waiting room is very comfortable and the people are hospitable and professional. Highly recommended :)
