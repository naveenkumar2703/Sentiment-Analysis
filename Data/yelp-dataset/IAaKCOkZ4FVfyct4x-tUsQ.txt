5	Convenient location right off the freewayClean enough bathroomGood selection inside the minimart AND things were on sale as they should be!
3	Not much to say about this inside of the Chevron here I have never been inside when I do go I will add to this. I have only put gas here. It is nice that it is right off the freeway. They keep the grounds here clean from what I noticed. Chevron is a little bit more than the Circle K that is on the other side of the freeway. Call me crazy but sometimes when I do put this gas in my vehicle it seems that it lasts longer. Maybe I am crazy but oh well.
3	So you are cruising out of the valley of the sun and need to get some gas, snacks, smokes, water, or take a leak, well this is a great place to stop. Its your average Chevron with a c-store attached to it. It covers all the basics inside. We got a bunch of water and my buddy wanted some smokes which he was able to pick up here as well. They have all of the usual drinks available too.Pricing is decent but nothing that you wouldn't anticipate in every single other c-store that you have been to in your life. Having this place literally as the first building off of the freeway makes for super convenience. But its just your average C-store and filler upper spot.
5	Techron for a steal compared to CA prices !! 40cents of tax savings !!!Nice big store for refreshments.
