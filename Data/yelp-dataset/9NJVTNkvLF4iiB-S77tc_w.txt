5	First thing I look for in a makeup artist is how thier own makeup looks. Catherines makeup always looks amazing, like she just applied it and like she glowing. She is talented, friendly and great to work with!
5	I can't thank Catherine enough for doing such a fantastic job on my daughter's and my make-up for my son's wedding.  She arrived promptly at our home and asked me how I wanted my make-up to look for the wedding.  She brought all of her own supplies and was very adept at applying my make-up for the late afternoon wedding.  She even gave us a touch up kit to take to the wedding in case we needed to reapply our make up but I didn't have to even use the kit.  I would definitely use her again.  I really appreciated that she was willing to come a little earlier so we could be ready for the wedding in plenty of time.  She is really talented and very pleasant.
5	Catherine and Alexis did an AMAZING job for my wedding March 22. They came in early to set up, so when they said we'll start at 10am, it's not we'll be there at 10am, it's we'll be ready to take your first girl at 10am.Catherine and Alexis were both so easy going and both so easy to talk too. They made all the girls feel comfortable. Not all my girls wanted their hair or makeup done, but when they started seeing the results, they all changed their minds!I absolutely loved my hair and it held the whole night. And my makeup was flawless. A couple of the girls are already planning to use them for their wedding, engaged or not. LOL
