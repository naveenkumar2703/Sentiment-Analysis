3	I use fossil fuels. It's a fact. And this is where I often get them. I'm sure you're thinking that I'm gassing up here and it's true, I do hit the petrol as hard as anybody. I haven't managed to kick that habit yet. But it's the propane I get here too. They are quick and convenient to top off the BBQ tank. Whenever I pop my head in and say I need propane, dude behind the counter hollers for a woman. She comes out to the tank and fills it up. Quickly and professionally, observing all applicable safety standards and OSHA regulations. Much more competent than Gomer at the Home Depot.
4	Very cheap gas prices compare to where I live and work.  It's right off I-10 & Chandler Blvd. between Ahwatukee & Chandler.  Very clean and has a lot of lighting, so you won't have to fear your life for being robbed.  This place is open 24/7 so you can stop by anytime you want.
4	This is a solid location. First, I feel that Chevron has the best fuel around and I try to go here whenever I need to gas up.This location is a little fated, but is clean, functional, and convenient. They offer gas, propane refills, and a car wash, and have a large selection inside, especially for the size of the store.
4	This is a clean gas station, with reasonably fast, new pumps, and the guy who seems to always be working in the little mart is friendly and helpful.
5	This place is awesome, good service and they have local beer on tap. Go get your Growler today!!! 64oz of heaven. I met the owner and he is the nicest guy ever.
