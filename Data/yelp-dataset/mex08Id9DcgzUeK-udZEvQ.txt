3	This was my first time here and would need to go back to make a more accurate  rating of this establishment. The atmosphere here was friendly, despite the fact it was really late night. Their bar seemed inadequately stocked, but the bartenders were accommodating and fun. I liked that there was a pool table and a spot near the house that is open 24 hrs a day is always a perk! Overall i had a good experience there at the end of a night of drinking and would come back to check it out again
4	Went here Saturday night, not too crowded.  Mostly an older crowd and friendly atmosphere.  My vodka and cran was weak, I had to order a shot but drinks are free when playing poker so how can I complain.  They need more machines at the bar though.  Best part was karaoke, music was awesome.  There seem to be folks lined up, most likely regulars because quite a few sung multiple songs.
3	Depending on the time you go, it could be good or bad.The food there is pretty good for bar food. Better than PT's or other major bars.The service has been a bit spotty. The guy with glasses is okay. The older lady sucks, and the big guy is awesome!They raised bucket prices which makes me not want to go back.Friday and Saturday night Karaoke is okay. The problem is the Man Witch and the Asian Boys To Men dominate the stage.  You're lucky to get 3 songs in.The atmosphere is nice, and they've improved the seating. I think it's BS they reserve seats for Asian Boys To Men. It should be first come, first serve.I only go there because my friends do. I'll go there again, but only when my friends go.
3	No food that i can see and no draft beer. Reminds me of Ohio. A diamond pool table and karaoke. Customers are friendly and you can sing your favorite songs because everyone is terrible but it's fun. Sort of like Champagnes for Summerlin.   Im giving it 3 stars because its pretty limited on what it offers but what they offer is pretty good if you just want to play pool and sing karaoke.
