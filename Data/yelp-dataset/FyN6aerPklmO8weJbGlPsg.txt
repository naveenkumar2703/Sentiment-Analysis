3	Everyone I talk with who has had this pizza loves it. I think it is fine, but love it, nope.No matter how I cook these things it turns out much more soggy than I would like. The ingrediants are fine but they sure do give off a lot of moisture when baking it.So it is not horrible, just not really to my liking.
3	we absolutely love the cheesy bread and the cinnamon wheel...BUT the pizza is just okay.  the take-and-bake concept is new to me so i knew that it was going to be hit or miss.  we ordered 2 pizzas and baked them following the instructions that came with it.  the crust on the first pizza didn't really bake well so i added a couple more minutes to the baking time with the second pizza but the inner crust was still kinda soggy.  like i said, the pizza is just okay.  the next pizza we'll have will be delivered to my front door :-)
5	Had it a few times. stuffed pizza's are the best.  cookie dough is great.  will be back.
5	The pizza is incredible, they use really high quality ingredients and the prices are great. I would recommend cooking it on the bottom rack of your oven for a slightly better texture on the crust.I want someone to mark that this post is funny, so I will add a joke:Mushroom walks into a bar... Bartender says, "sorry, we don't serve your type here." Mushroom says "why not? I'm a fungi (fun guy)."
1	Tried this place for the first time. Never again! It looks good but it tastes horrible! Nothing wrong with service, just think the company doesn't get the best ingredients.
4	So why would I cook my own pizza?  Because at this place I can get just artichokes and sun dried tomatoes and I'm willing to heat my house with the oven to have it my way!!
