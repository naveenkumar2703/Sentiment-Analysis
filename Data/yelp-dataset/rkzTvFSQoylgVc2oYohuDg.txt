4	Great burritos! to be honest, everything on the menu is really good. I'm a fan of the Chorrizo burrito, it has egg and potatoes, very tasty. I use to live right around the corner from here so I had the chance to try pretty much everything on the menu. The easiest way to rate this place would be to say it is just as good or better than your Filberto's, Fredrico's and your Armando's. The prices are a bit cheaper for example a Carne Asada burrito runs $4.60. The din in portion of the restaurant is really small, I usually take out. If your in the area, stop by and give it a try.
4	In all the years I have eaten here, I have never been sick.
4	I've been going to this place for years and have always enjoyed their chicken tacos/ tortas and chili relleno burritos! The people that work there are very nice and speak English well (a total plus for a coconut like me!).
4	This place is a total dive but the staff is friendly and the food is great. I love how they they toast the tortilla on my carne asada. It's a regular for that burrito fix.
