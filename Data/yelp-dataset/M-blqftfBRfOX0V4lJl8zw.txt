4	This place was the life saviour for the dinner @ 1pm. We were trying to find another resturant and were not able to get there and we saw dominos. The staff (nite shift) was really helpful and he let us in once his delivery person came back, as he said the place is not safe so he didnt let us in as he was alone during that time. we were able to get two large pizzas and bread sticks in no time and finally were able to eat the dinner. Dominos you saved the day.:)
2	The quality of the food is usually quite good.  Our delivery persons have always been polite.  Except for that one kid that assumed he could keep my change of $4 and then only had $5's and two dollars...really?  I only tip pizza guys $2 since they charge me for delivery anyway.)The only real issue I have is that they are constantly getting my orders wrong!  What in the world could possibly be going on inside this place where every other or every third order (or so it seems) is jacked up?  I've had wrong toppings, missed toppings, toppings that were replaced because they were out and didn't call to notify me.
2	Ok, maybe I'll just keeping a tally here.Ordered the usual, 2 topping med pizza with meat and a bacon/jalapeno cheesy bread.  I got the 2 topping with meat and a CHEESE stuffed cheesy bread, instead, again.If I had better pizza delivery places to choose from...I would.  But for now, I'm stuck with them and they're stuck with me.  I think they are conspiring against me.So, now I sit and wait 45 minutes for the correct cheesy bread to be delivered.  I hope they don't put any extra "ingredients" in there!Until next time, happy eating!
1	This place is a joke one of the drivers almost hit my wife racing down lake mead on back to back days. Also had two kids in the car. Called the manager and he told me to f off. Class!!!!
4	Was perfect for Sunday. Pizza and Football is the best. Staff was also great and helpful. i Recommend this Domino's.
