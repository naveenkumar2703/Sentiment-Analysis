5	Rockin selection of bikinis and sexy one-pieces.  There were suits that even had Missoni-esque designs and knitting.  The store also has some cool undies from CA that are screen-printed with different designs.  I found a pair with Marilyn Monroe and butterflies pretty groovy!  There is also a case by the register with a small selection of jewelry.  A guy shreds old vinyl records and makes them into bracelets then studs them out with grommets.  If you are staying in the Cosmo roll over to this store it has some interesting finds.
3	Weird experience here. It was raining outside and my heels for the night became  a little wet and uncomfy. Went in to Molly Brown's to grab a pair of sandals.We said, anything in a size 7 or 8 would do...trying to make it easy. Apparently that wasn't easy. After 20+ minutes they still hadn't gotten it and I just walked out with a simple pair of flip flops.Odd that the store is a beach, bikini like store but named after Molly Brown. I don't think Molly Brown would have wanted to be wearing a string bikini while the Titanic was sinking.Other than that they seemed to have a good selection of swimwear.
2	If you're in a jam, maybe drop by here to find cover-ups, but beware because there's a lot of hits and misses. Most cover-ups are overpriced, but I managed to find one that was under $100 and reasonably classy looking. Their suits are beautiful, but again overpriced for it's lackluster designs. The sales girls are really the most annoying part of the overpriced experience. They're helpful only when it appears that you're willing to pay the exorbitant prices and even then, they are completely uninterested in trying to provide customer service.
4	Really sexy swimsuits, but be prepared to drop a couple hundred dollars on a good one. If that's your thing, definitely make a stop here.
