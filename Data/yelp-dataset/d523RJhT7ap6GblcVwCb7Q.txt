5	Granted I am there 4 to 6 times a week I have to say the staff is truly amazing. Lawrence has one of the best personalities with the ability to make you feel like family. Facility is well maintained and the sports camp coaches are just phenomenal. With the minor exception of the scheduling for aquatics programs, the water park and pool is great as well!
3	The facilities are clean and things are set up well with regards to equipment, the pool, the courts, etc.  The front desk staff can be difficult to deal with; they are not rude or impolite, but it's mainly the lack of information regarding general questions and inconsistency in assistance that can be frustrating (i.e., informed of a process to sign my child up for extracurricular activities, only to be told a completely different thing upon check in or sign up).  Often these little minor issues are corrected after talking to someone beyond the front desk, but it's an extra step, a headache, a step that creates more work for everyone on tasks that are quite simple.  But it's the only gig in town as far as community centers go, and the environment and ambiance is nice, so we just deal with it.
