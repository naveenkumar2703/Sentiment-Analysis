5	Un-Believe-Able.  I could not have been happier with this photographer. Unfortunately I didn't know about them before I got married, but if I had I would have flown them all the way to Michigan just so they could shoot my wedding day. I hired them to do my Trash the Dress photo shoot and they were amazing, but wait it gets better they were CHEAP!  They came all the way to Phoenix from Flagstaff with two photographers and an assistant on a Sunday, and the whole thing only cost me $400!  That included the 4 hours of photos and the hi-res disk with release rights.  They had the most amazing ideas and they were super friendly and fun. Just thinking about it makes me want to get married all over again just so I can hire them to be my wedding photographer.  I would recommend them for ANY occasion and from what I understand they will travel almost anywhere.  Look on their site they have some great galleries.Date of service: April 2010
5	What a pleasure working with Kevin and Tina. They were great from the beginning, timely, responsive, thorough and friendly. The price was very reasonable.  Looking forward to seeing all the beautiful shots!!!
