5	I have been using Joe Maggiore for the past year to manage my rental home in the East Valley.  It was the 1st time that I had ever worked with a property manager, as I had always done it by myself.  From the start, Joe was very hands on and involved.  He takes care of everything for me, tenant relations, maintenance and repair of my home and it's appliances, landscaping needs, HOA dues, etc.  I receive monthly updates about my rental, so I am always kept in the loop as to what is going on, never leaving me with questions.Joe Maggiore truly provides me with COMPLETE property management service.I have been so pleased with the service that Joe has provided, that I will be looking to use his services as my Property Manager and as my Realtor for the next rental property that I will be looking to purchase in the spring.
5	Joe is an outstanding Realtor, very professional and skilled in the business.
5	Joe has been my property manager for over 4 years. We have been extremely happy with the service we have received. We have had excellent tenants with Joe that have never missed a payment and maintain our property. We have and will continue to recommend him to anyone who needs a property manager.
