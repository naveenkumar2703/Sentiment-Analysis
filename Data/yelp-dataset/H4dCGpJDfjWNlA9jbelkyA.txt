5	Mary helped me end the nightmare when my mortgage payments exceeded the value of my home.  She diligently managed every aspect of my short sale.  She negotiated terms that prevented the bank from coming after me in the future & she worked with me to fix my credit when it was all over.  In a world full of short term players looking for a quick win Mary hung in there with me for the long haul.  2 years later she helped me buy & sell another property so I could recoup some of my losses on the previous transaction.In both cases Mary & her team were patient, professional & thorough.  I have never encountered anyone better!
5	I am really glad that we found Mary Preheim Group, after buying and selling several houses in our lives I can honestly say that Mary and her well chosen assistants (Jessica) in particular did a FANTASTIC job! They were on the ball and kept me posted along the way. Did absolutely everything they said they would do at our first meeting. Answered every call and question I had, every time. Job well done! A++
