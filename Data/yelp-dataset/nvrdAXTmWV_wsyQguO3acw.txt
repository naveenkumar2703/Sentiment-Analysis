5	I'd have to say TTY has been a good experience. The instructors have been super helpful. They do what they can to motivate you to keep coming to class and keep going. I read the previous review, and I disagree. I came here on my own free will and was not pressured to start. I passed my A+ and Network+ with their help and have been working on my CCNA.  A lot of people here have told me this place has helped them too. I remember when I first showed up and got right to work. They provided me all the tools that I needed to get moving. If you want to speak to someone there, ask to speak to Hiro (instructor) or Gabe (instructor), they both have real life experience in the IT industry. Both can walk you through understanding anything you need.
3	I attended a week long Salesforce training session at this location.  Staff was nice.  Class was small, which was choice. The instructor was independent, contracted through Salesforce.  The first two days of class, we had a bucket of juices offered in the back of the class room.  I wondered why there was no water included and why the bucket disappeared after day two.  There were always bagels and fruit offered in reception but I was never offered any and didn't know if they were available to us.  The receptionist brought in cookies, every  day at 2pm.  The instructor eventually told us that we could get water and soda out of the cooler in the hallway.  That was a saving grace since we were stuck in this dark room for intense training all day long. Location is good and they have plenty of parking.  I attended in the peak of summer heat in Arizona and was cool and comfy all day.
5	This is a great place if you're looking to enhance skills in Microsoft Office, Photoshop, etc. My consultant is Nick and he's very friendly, helpful, and accessible.
