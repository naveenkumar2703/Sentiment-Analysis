4	I am a full time traveler and have difficulty finding a good nail salon. This one fit the bill nicely. I soent 5 months in the area and went every 3 weeks for colored acrylic.Ask for Danny. He did excellent work and I had absolutely no problems with the outcome.  They easily would last longer but I tired of the color so we changed it every 3 weeks. I recommend this salon for nail but I cannot speak to pedicures although they are very busy.
5	My mother & I just tried this salon (now canyon nails) & it was great! It is very clean, very polite, assistive ( as my mom is in her 70's), & super comfy chairs with great chair massage! Plus they are $5 less for same spa pedicure I used to get in Gilbert! We will definitely be going back there! Very nice place!
2	I have been a customer here for the past three winters and have always had a good experience. I typically have a pedicure and acrylic nails and I always go to the same person. Although the personnel there has not changed, this winter, I have had to wait 30 minutes plus after my appointment time before anyone started working on me. Last week, was the third time this happened. When I arrived, I was told it would be a few minutes. After 30 minutes, I was told to sit at my person's table. It was only then that I realized he was only about half-way through working on someone's pedicure. After another 5 minutes of waiting, I left and will not be returning. There is no point in making appointments if there is no intention to keep them. He obviously started the pedicure moments before my appointment when he should have set that time aside for my appointment. Very disappointed.
5	I loved the design and sparkles I got to my nails! My grandma said is was the best pedicure she ever got. Super clean and funny people.
