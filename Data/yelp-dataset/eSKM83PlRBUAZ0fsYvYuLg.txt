1	Owner is a greedy crook.Supreme pizza is $8.50, hawaiian is $6.50. Ordered half hawaiian/half supreme. When I picked up the pizza, the owner charged $13.50 for an 8 dollar pizza. What kind of scam is the owner trying to run?! The d-bag owner tried to give some BS excuse that he doesn't do half/half on pizzas & instead doubles the toppings on each half of a single pizza. WTF?! I didn't order double toppings, a-hole. Of course he doesn't tell you this when you order, he waits until you're picking up your pizza, charges you and hopes you don't notice the 70% mark-up on the price.He then tried to explain that his way is cheaper by telling me that two large pizzas would have been $15 and he's doing me a favor and saving me money. So what you just told me is that because of your little scam I just paid $13 for one pizza when I could have paid $15 for two pizzas?! You just made yourself look like an even more of an A-hole, dude.How anyone believes they can get away with trying to rip people off in the age of the internet is beyond me.P.S. I called 4 other Little Caesars franchises in the area and none of them charge 70% extra do a half/half pizza.
5	The 5$ pizza never fails! We've come here a zillion times and the pizza is delicious. I highly recommend it!
