4	Paid $20 cash for a smog here.In and out fairly quickly...drive-thru style setup.Service guy was friendly and talkative...gave him a couple bucks for the extra effort.Recommended if you are nearby!
1	Went here for a smog and had a coupon for an Economy Buster Special 17.99.  Take the truck there and it's a Chevy 2500.  The attendant refuses to take the coupon stating this is a heavy duty vehicle and the coupon doesn't apply.  There are no disclaimers on the coupon!  I called another Smog Buster and was told the coupon should have been accepted without any question.Do not go to this Smog Busters...they are a joke!
1	I have gone to smog busters yearly for 10 years now. I am always so pleased to get in and out quickly and of course saving money with them matching comp coupons, but...this last week the guy wanted to argue with me over every coupon I had not only he argued but in a scary/creepy way. In the end I ended up paying full price because I just wanted to get outta there "scared". I love it there but I won't return now because of this bad experience.
