2	i don't get it - other Tesco's seem to have much better stock than this one. It takes an age to find anything with a slightly off kilter layout from Tesco's that has me all confused. The number of times on the way home from work, I've stopped in only to find that the item I am looking for isn't available here... but is at my local store. I guess my question really is, Tesco Superstore, Hermiston Gait, what is your point?
