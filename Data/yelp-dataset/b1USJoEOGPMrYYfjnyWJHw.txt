4	Delicious frozen yogurt, great toppings and friendly staff. Fat free = guilt free so whats not to love?
2	Given all the yogurt places in today's market, the flavor quality here does not impress.
1	Too bad I can't do zero stars.  This place is busy and everytime i get a coupon in the mail i think.....let's try it one more time.  Even with the 50% off coupon....still not worth it.  Not good at all......especially for a yogurt shop.
