2	Never will I go back here again... I think its time store manager for a staff meeting in customer service..i have never seen a more sad crew of people in my life.. Especially the cashiers. Never do they look up and look face to face and ask have we found everything okay.i dont even think they hear my answer.. And some of them look like their uniforms need a good washing, also ever heard of an iron?. I also have never been more disgusted then hearing a cashier and bagger talk about there night out together and how drunk they got.. Keep it for the break room ladies... Maybe a field trip to Safeway is in order... Now Safeway has it together.. Yes a little more pricy but well worth the great customer service..and I have never heard a dirty story come out of the staffs mouth.. Sucks because frys is much more convenient for me..
1	Bad customer service. So ghetto. They have sorry ass set up here. Nobody can help you to find what you need. The cashiers look mad that you are shopping there. I really just don't like this frys. Never again.
5	Absolutely love everything about this store! Management is always friendly and helpful and the other employees always seem to be in a great mood just begging to find a way to help your shopping experience! My new favorite place to buy groceries!
