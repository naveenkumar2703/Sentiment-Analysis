3	I agree the bread sticks are the best. The pizza is good for $5.00
4	the price is unbeatable as mentioned earlier. $5 for a hot and ready one topping pizza. They are consistently good, their dough is the best in our town. Plus it's always convenient.
5	How can you complain about a $5.00 pizza.
5	Great price (duh) and they are super fast. I've never waited longer than 5 minutes to get in and grab some food. Nice folks behind the counter, too.
3	Typical little caesars but it's hot and ready and close to me so great when you feel lazy. I'm glad they brought back the pan style pizza.
5	Let's be realistic. Anytime you go to an establishment that is ran by teenagers and you don't receive attitude, it's a win. The pizza is always the same, cheap but tolerable. I would recommend buying a dipping sauce or even a marinara sauce to go along with your pizza because if you don't it is pretty dry.
1	Been here a couple times mainly due to the short distance, loved it until it gave me and others food poisoning. Not sure what on earth was wrong with it but I even went to the Banner hospital nearby because I was chronically vomiting every 30 or so minutes. Never eating food from a place full of dirty teenage employees.
