4	good, inexpensive clips
4	I'm a guy, I don't require much time or effort for my haircut.  I tried the check in app for phone and it saved me some waiting time.  You know, the one guy or family the  runs to the door ahead of you causing an extra long waiting time.  Great idea on the app.
1	I hate to write anything negative, however my experience here was a BAD one. I went in and asked for a stacked a line cut but ended up leaving in tears with gaps in the hair on the back of my head. The guy who did my hair was very rough with me, constantly throwing my head around. I would not recommend this place if you want a very specific hair cut.
4	I've been seeing Euyoung for 11 years now, she's very consistent and friendly.  I like how Great Clips offer coupons and periodic specials.
