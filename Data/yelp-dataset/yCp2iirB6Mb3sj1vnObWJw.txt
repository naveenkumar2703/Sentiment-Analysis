4	I have only recently become a tanning enthusiast and I have to say, I am enjoying it. This place is just down the street from me and I have enjoyed my experiences thus far.  The place is always clean and the staff is prompt when making sure the beds are clean and ready to go.  They offer multiple services and beds (including stand up) and also spray tans.  They run specials on occasion which helps if you are on a budget, but the prices are reasonable as far as tanning salons go.  If you are in the area and looking for a tan, I recommend stopping by to see what they have to offer.  The staff is always smiling and willing to help.
1	Okay, so I actually joined Yelp so I could comment on this business. I purchased an Amazon local coupon which the owner refused to accept. Instead I was offered to purchase a tanning package for 65 dollars. I am unsure why the owner would sign up for the Amazon deal if she was unwilling to accept the voucher. It was a huge waste of my time. Not only did I drive out there to redeem my voucher but I also had to return home and call Amazon to receive a refund for the voucher I purchased. It is a very poor way to run a business and is a quick way to alienate customers. Even though it is down the street from my house I will not be returning.
1	Went today to get a tan and they were closed. Said they were going to be open at 11am, waited almost and hour and nothing. Waste of my time!!!
