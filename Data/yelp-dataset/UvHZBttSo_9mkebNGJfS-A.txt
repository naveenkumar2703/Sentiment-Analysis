3	Play place under renovation. Bad wi-fi mojo.  Service should be a little better to keep the place worth coming to.
4	I've hit more McyD's in the past week than in my entire life combined! While on a road trip from San Diego to Flagstaff I found McDonald's $.99 Diet Coke to be my best companion! The curb-appeal was impressive and the dual drive through was appreciated. I placed my order, "Diet Coke please" and when the kind drive-through attendance asked if I wanted to add an egg white McMuffin I gladly obliged. The drive through was quick and friendly. I was pleasantly surprised the egg white McMuffin was only $2 whereas in San Diego it's over $4! I've been impressed with the service, cost and speed I've received with McDonald's while on this trip.
1	I am absolutely disgusted in the manager Erica at this location. I took my mom to go get her senior coffee that she likes to order. When we placed her order I was going to get my usual iced mocha coffee but then Erica started interrogating us about who was with me and she asked if I had two seniors with me. She then asked me if I had ID. Seriously lady you are carding me for freaking 69 cent coffee??? I will not be returning to McDonalds after this. ( THIS IS AN OLD POST BUT FOR SOME REASON IT WAS NEVER POSTED)
5	This is a great McDonalds. It has video games that the kids love. My grandkids always ask to come to this McDonald's
5	Wow. Not a typical McDonald's. I stopped in this location today for a quick breakfast because I had an hour to kill before an appointment. Anyway, this is maybe the nicest McDonald's I've ever been inside.The interior is new and there is lots of comfortable seating all over. The staff was friendly and quick. The manager even came out while I was eating and refilled coffees for everyone in the lobby. My food was fresh and hot and overall it was just a pleasure having breakfast here. If I lived closer I would definitely stop in again.
