4	Ross is my go-to place for housewares, bedding, and kitchen stuff, because here I'm able to get the same quality stuff for significantly cheaper than at other retailers. Because it's a closeout store, though, you can never be guaranteed to find what you're looking for, especially if you're concerned for specific brands. But at half the MSRP for stuff, it's well worth rolling the dice. This Ross is very well-organized, clean, and offers a decent selection on most things. Lines are short, as it's not very busy, but the store feels a bit empty somehow, like there's not enough stock to fill it out.
3	Good bargains on clothes and housewares. Customer service is not a strong point at this store.
3	Forgot to pack socks on my trip to AZ!!! Well apparently hiking in high heels is not the best idea, so I had to find somewhere along the way!!! This Ross is huge but barely filled!!! Such a low selection of inventory... But I found what I was looking for, and even found a perfume that was discontinued a few years ago so that made my day.Otherwise the staff here were all pretty happy and happy to hear I was from Cali :) Great staff but sadly a low selection of everything :(
4	This Ross has a nice variety of goods at, of course, great prices.  As with all other Ross Stores, it's a matter of being "lucky" in finding what you need/want in your size, color, etc.  I enjoy browsing through nearly every department and can usually find something I could use.  Now, if only the jewelry section at this location carried more than watches, it would certainly make my day!
1	The WORST Ross ever! The staff treats everyone as a theft. Will not going back anymore! TJ Max next door will be my only choice!
