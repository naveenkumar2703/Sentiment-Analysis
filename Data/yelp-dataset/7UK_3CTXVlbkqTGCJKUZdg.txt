1	What a profound disappointment.  First, in terms of design, it's simply one of the coolest restaurants in Montreal. It has this 1970s Moroccan salon style that reminds me of a Middle Eastern recreation of the Cantina from Star Wars. They also have belly dancing performances. Sounds good but then you go.  First problem: the food. It's unbelievably overpriced and the food is just plain mediocre.  The table d'hote to go with the "belly dancing" special costs something like 40 bucks with tax. This is an insane price for couscous (which basically costs nothing) with poor quality meat (fatty) and even more poorly prepared (dry, dry, dry).  But I guess you pay not so much for the food but for the show and for the atmosphere.  And that brings us to the next problem. The belly dancing show that I saw was mediocre at best (the dancer just wasn't that good) and the sound system was so bad it was hissing more static than music. And the final strike: the obnoxious people who go there. My impression is that its mainly middle-aged Hydro Quebec and government workers from the office towers nearby (the kind who try to assert their individuality by dying their hair unnatural shades of red and purple) who go after a day of soul-sucking bureaucratic labor in order to escape into some exotic fantasy land. So it basically has the same contrived vibe that you'd expect in a beach resort.
