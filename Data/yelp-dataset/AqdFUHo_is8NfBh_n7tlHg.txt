5	ummmm.... the baconator might be the best fast food burger ever made.
3	Wendy's food should be about the same regardless of location. This review is not about the food, but the service.I stopped here today on my way to Rocker World. Wow, what a mistake. The food was fine, but I've never seen slower fast food service in my life. I waited 10 minutes in line with 2 other orders in front of me and another 10 minutes for the food. I'm still deciding if the new fries with sea salt are as good as the previous fries.....Unless you have lots of time, you may want to hit another location.
3	Best fast food breakfast in the valley! Beats McDonalds by a longshot! Worth trying and don't forget to order the #1 combo...Artisan Breakfast Sandwich with Bacon and get the seasoned potatos as your side and coffee. YUM!
5	It's a pretty good Wendy's. I came here while my oil is getting changed at Walmart and was craving a baked potato. I also got a jr bacon cheeseburger off the value menu. Cheap filling and tastes good.The store is clean and one of the workers brought a missing item they ordered to the table next to me, instead of yelling from the counter and all the employees were smiling. I think that's a great indication of a great restaurant even if it is fast food.
1	Rude workers and barely any toppings on my burgers ever! I go shopping and want a quick burger fix but every time I come to this location it's the same thing. Idk why I keep coming back! Geeze on me! I even debate on del taco but noooo I choose Wendy's and the same thing every time! Take my $20 and screw me over! Smashed burgers, no toppings and practically throw my food at me! How rude! And when I ask for salt every time I get rolling eyes! Shame on you!
5	Friendliest Wendy's I have ever been to.Very clean.  Fast. No complaints.  Great staff, great fast eats.
