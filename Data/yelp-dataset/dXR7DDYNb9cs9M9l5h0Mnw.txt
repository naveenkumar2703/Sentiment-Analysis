4	Got a massage and facial with Beth...she was professional and did a great job. The massage especially really relaxed me and worked out my knots. There is some noises here and there from hairdressers talking loud since it is located in a salon, but you are in a private room so its not too bad.
5	Destiny gave me a great massage!  She was very nice and I would definitely recommend her to anyone.  Thank you destiny for fighting with my crazy shoulder knots!
5	Beth is the bomb. Best lash gal in town. My lashes look AMAZING and feel great. She knows her stuff. And keeps them healthy at the same time. I recommend her to everyone. La la love her.
5	Went in for a message with Beth. Was a great message, she concentrated on my trouble spots. I left feeling fantastic. I will return.
