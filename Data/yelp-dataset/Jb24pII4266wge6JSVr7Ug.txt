5	If you are looking for the secret ingredient that will help you be more efficient  and ultimately more profitable...I have been working with Brenda at Balanced Organizing Solutions for six months and the level of my productivity has gone up greatly because of my ability to be more efficient with my time.   I highly recommend utilizing her expertise because her Organizing skills extend well beyond what one might think of when getting organized. As business owners, we don't know how we lived without her!  Marc and Jill Abelmanowners of Inside Style Home.

Her ideas go way beyond my expectaions of what 'organizing' means!  She is truly amazing, friendly, and professional.  I highly recommend her.
5	Brenda at Balanced Organizing Solutions is a miracle worker! I brought her in before doing a major remodel of my business space and it was the best thing I could have done! She helped with coming up with a new layout, where things could live in the new space and gave me rules to figure out what really wasn't worth my space - I still live by those rules not only in my office but in all my other spaces! She is fabulous, does wonderful work, takes the time to understand what your priorities are and comes up with ideas that are truly helpful!
