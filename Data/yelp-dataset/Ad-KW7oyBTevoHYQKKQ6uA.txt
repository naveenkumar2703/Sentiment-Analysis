4	I love Mrs Smith! It is a fabulous little boutique fashion store in the centre of the busy and bustling Morningside Road in Edinburgh, close to the city centre so very easy to get to. Mrs Smith sells really smart and sophisticated clothes for women. Most of their clothes are 'work' clothes, such as nice trousers and blouses, but there are also plenty of lovely dresses and skirts which are very summery. Mrs Smith is a relatively new addition to the Edinburgh fashion boutique seen as it opened last year. Personal stylists are available which is fantastic as they are able to assist you if you are unsure which colours go or what style of clothes suit your body shape. The clothes in this store are of excellent quality and will last for years, and as a result, they are a wee bit pricey.If I am ever looking for a lovely outfit to wear to work, Mrs Smith is my first and only port of call. Amazing.
4	For the fashion conscious lady with a sophisticated style, Mrs Smith ticks all the right boxes. Well presented clothing, well made and at reasonable prices with friendly staff ensures that a trip to Mrs Smith is always pleasant and enjoyable. As the other reviewers have mentioned, Mrs Smith clothes are especially good if you're looking for something smart but still fashionable for work. They have gorgeous blouses, jackets, suit trousers and other smart items of clothing all excellently tailored and flattering.In addition to smart clothing they also offer a selection of dresses and pretty tops that you could wear everyday or for more fun, formal occasions.
