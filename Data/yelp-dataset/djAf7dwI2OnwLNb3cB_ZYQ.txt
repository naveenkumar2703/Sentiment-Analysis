Its hard to find sales persons like this these days.Pat also assisted my mom and sister ;)5 STAR SERVICE ask for Pat!I LOVE my dress!!!!!!!!!
5	I love a lot of the tops and dresses that they have here. I found some really nice tops that I thought would be great gifts for my cousins and my best friend. I had to try some on and take a look. I found an associate quickly and was trying things on as quickly as I could. The associate was attentive and very polite. They gave me their honest opinons and were able to give me their suggestions. I really appreciated the time that they took with me, to look for sizes, look for alternatives or items that were similar to ones that I seemed interested in, etc. It's hard to find someone who will really work for your business. great customer service and care
4	Cute little store. Walking around during our lunch break, we happened upon Cache at the Venetian. Their sales associates were very friendly and helpful. They seem to have regular sales and their prices aren't too bad for a shopping place inside the Venetian. They have a great selection of clothing, but we were mostly mesmerized by the selection of jewelry. My co-worker ended up buying quite a few pieces that were adorable. I'll be back if I'm in the area.
