5	Went into this Gamestop located on Nellis Air Force Base -- did not know there was one on base -- since I needed one more Xmas gift for the young man. Best part was that there is no tax on base!! I also got a car charger pack for the young man and the staff was very helpful as well as knowledgeable about what I wanted.If you are able to shop on base, this location has fast service, polite and friendly staff members and did I mention, NO tax?I was in and out of there within minutes! Now, that's my kind of shopping!
2	Customer service was ok, if you stood in line and waited to be helped. I mention this because everyone was standing in line even for general questions because at this store, I can only assume that management requires the staff to stay behind the register, as opposed to wandering the floor because when I was there, that seemed to be their MO. I eventually walked out without buying anything because after the first time I waited in line (short wait), the store got much busier and I wasn't going to wait in line a second time. I wasn't the only customers this location lost that night - when I was outside, two families were discussing their plans to just go to another store because they couldn't get helped. As for me, it all worked out because someone gave me gift cards the next day that allowed me to download the games and avoid having to go back in.
