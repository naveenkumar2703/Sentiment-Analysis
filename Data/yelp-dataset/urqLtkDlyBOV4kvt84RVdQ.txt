5	Had a vinyl strap replaced on a patio chair in less than 15 minutes. Great service and very reasonable!
5	Amazing work! Judy at the front desk has mass amount of knowledge and was great to chat with. If your looking to fix up your old patio furniture then this is the place to go.
5	This is a family owned and run business. That is something I seek when I'm after quality. They replaced all the straps on my vinyl chairs and had them done before they promised. They have a wide variety of colors. They also do sling chairs and powder coating. I will use them for all my future needs and recommend them to everyone.
5	Excellent service. Professional work. Fair pricing. We considered buying new but this was a better option. They will help you unload and load. Cheaper than doing it myself. Far away from me but worth the drive.
