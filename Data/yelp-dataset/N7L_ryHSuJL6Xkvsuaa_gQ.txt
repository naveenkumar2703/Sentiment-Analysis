1	Horrible customer service, went in looking for a specific pair of shoes I needed for a wedding and no one greeted me or acknowledged me at all. After I found the shoes on my own I went to check out and there was a woman already checking out and then another customer was waiting behind me and the other cashier rang them up first when I was clearly the next customer. Both cashiers were unprofessional, talking to each other the entire checkout process and never once said hi or looked at me. I'll never shop here again.
3	not a bad store just pricey.  Service was good and friendly had some cute shoes for women and kids but my husband did not find anything
