3	Well if you're still stuck in the 90s "modern" or want to find those homey cozy light fixtures, you'll find a range of styles here ... bits of everything but pretty pricey after sightseeing your typical home improvement box stores.  Still a solid choice if you can't find anything elsewhere, if you're willing to pay for it.
4	I like this place.My girlfriend and I had been meaning to check this place out forever and finally got the chance to do so.  Talk about selection!  We wandered around for a little while just taking it all in.  The lady that helped us (I think her name was Darcy) was delightful.  She explained how everything worked and that they had an even bigger selection online.  They can print out pictures of anything they have so you can take it home and think about it.  I also like the fact that they have a 60 day return policy with no restocking fees.We found a couple pieces that we were interested in but we are in the information gathering stages as we aren't at the point of making the changes we want yet.  I will definitely say that I was impressed and will keep this place as a contender for future purchases.  It may be a little pricier but the selection is great.  Make sure to sign up for the rewards program because they send you information that helps save you some money.Check them out.
3	Oh man is this place overpriced.  I love chandeliers.  I need one in every room in order to be happy.  So, I shop a lot for chandeliers and I feel I have a good guess on what they should be priced.  As I walked up and down the aisles, I was shocked by how overpriced everything was.  They do have beautiful fixtures but you have to sell a kidney to buy one.
