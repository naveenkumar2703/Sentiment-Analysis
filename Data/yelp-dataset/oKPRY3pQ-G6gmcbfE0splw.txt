3	We (my husband, 2 friends and I) visited Tavola last night because of a Yelp review. We weren't as enthusiastic. The service was great! We ordered 2 pizza's and 2 salads. The salads were fresh, that was a nice surprise, not bagged. The pizza was good. Crust was a thicker than we like. Not a bad experience at all just not quite what we expected after the 5 stars.
4	My husband and I really enjoy this Pizza Stop! They have the Greasy like wings (Butter Sauce) that I Personally LOVE!  The Pizza is Greasy But DELICIOUSE!!  They have a few T.V.'s up. its not the most up beat joint but its Pretty Dar n GOOD!  Definatly something to try! Take a Break from the Hut , and try this place!! We are Ordering Wings there tonight!
3	So so.  Better than the other chain pizza places in Buckeye.
