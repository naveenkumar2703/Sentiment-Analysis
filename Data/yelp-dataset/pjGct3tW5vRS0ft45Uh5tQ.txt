5	I give this little salon 5 stars because they are able to do exactly what I ask. That being said,  I get a standard pedicure and standard manicure. I do not get gels, full sets, or amazing designs, so I am unable to review those services.This is a family establishment, husband and wife team. Very friendly and they do quick work. Getting in is easy if you call the morning of to make your appointment and I am able to get in and out within my hour lunch period.
