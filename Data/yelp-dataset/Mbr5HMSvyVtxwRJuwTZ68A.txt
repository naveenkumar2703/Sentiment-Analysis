4	I had never been to a chiropractor before going here. I messed up my back and a friend told me to try a chiropractor. Luckily this one is around the corner from my house. I gave it a shot and the treatments started to help right away. On top of getting better, the office staff really makes this place lovely. They welcome you upon arrival and make you feel at home. I haven't seen anyone here cranky or grouchy. They also make sure you are called back quickly and always on time. I did most of my treatments with Dr. Wallace and Dr. Paul, both of whom were great.
