3	Very private, very quiet....very boring!!!
4	A very relaxing and private pool area in the MGM Grand.  Very exceptional service and the food was great.  When you enter the pool the server bring over a bucket of Fuji water over ice.  They also come over pretty often to seek your needs.
5	The Mansion pool is absolutely insane! The service is incredible- everyone is there to insure you have everything you need. It is quiet, secluded, and very exclusive. We were fortunate enough to dine on the patio nearby and were absolutely amazed by the six star level this hotel operates on.
