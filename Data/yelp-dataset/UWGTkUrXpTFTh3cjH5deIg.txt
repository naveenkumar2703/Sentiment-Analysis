5	Had a problem with a coupon here, and the cashier and manager were extremely helpful in resolving it. I will definitely keep shopping here simply because of the extra service they provided to help.
5	Best Old Navy in town!
5	Went here to get some work clothes and found exactly what I needed. Store wasn't busy when I came in or left which was good for me since I did not have to wait in a line while checking out. The dressing rooms are big which I like so I don't have to feel crammed in a small space while trying clothes on. I also did like how they played music in the store, it wasn't too loud or too quite. Employees were nice and gave me a coupon for an upcoming sale which was nice.
3	I haven't been to old navy in awhile so I was okay with this store. First time it was pretty messy from all the Christmas shoppers but the second time was a little cleaner. They did have good sales for all ages.
1	Rude staff with horrible management! Not returning for a loooooooong time! The cashier had no manners, continually messing up. Then she had to have a sweet manager come to help. That was fine. But once the manager left, another rude amber came in with an attitude. This did nothing to help fix the problem. Won't be returning.
