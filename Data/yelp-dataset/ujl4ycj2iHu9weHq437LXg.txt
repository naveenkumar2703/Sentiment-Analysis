5	this cute little pizza, salad and pasta place in east chandler is great. my mom can't eat food with gluten, which pretty much rules out anything with bread. this place is the only restaurant i know of that specializes in gluten-free pizza. pretty genius as actually quite a few people are allergic to gluten and now they have a restaurant to go to! they have regular crust too, as well as gluten free beer and gluten free brownies. if you know someone who can't eat gluten products get them a gift cert to this place or pick them up a Brownie, they will love it!
1	Have you ever been to a place & walked out feeling like you were ass raped?  well, if you're into that, you'll love this joint!!!The food is terrible....but I felt even worse because it was expensive for the shit they gave you.  We got a medium sausage, which at any other place is a very small pizza, and it was $22 with tax & tip (no drinks...just water).  Don't be fooled by this "gourmet" shit either.  The crust is tasteless & the quality just isn't there.when I compare this to say Oreganos, they are not even in the same ball league.skip this joint....and save your money.
1	didn't they close already?. we wasted $23 on a all organic gluten free pizza that took them an hour to deliver less than 1/2 mile, and it was tasteless and the size of half a large pizza.
5	I really enjoy Pizza Picazzo.  I think the food is wonderful.  The gluten free pizza and pasta's are really good.  My family can eat from the regular menu and I can eat GF without worrying about getting ill.  GF is pricey anywhere I've gone.  I always take half home and get two meals out of it to offset the price.The ambiance is really nice too.  I have gotten several varieties of pasta and pizza and tend towards the southwestern flavors as I'm also intolerant to pork products.
