3	Ya'll know what McDonald's is, yar bugger. If you've absolutely got to have your mayo and fried food fix, this McD's will suffice. It's average. It's not a stay-away-at-all-costs McD's, and it's not the superstar McD's that I'm sure exists somewhere.It's new-ish and still in good shape. Nice people. No kiddie play area. Comical dual drive-through, one of whose lanes is blocked off half the time, probably to prevent the drive-through rage that ensues when the person in the next lane cuts you off when it was "your turn".
2	People are nice but this is the slowest mcdonalds ever
1	Went here today about 4:30 pm. Asked for fries with no salt. Never had a problem any where else but, apparently here it's an issue.  I received  plenty of attitude from my cashier when asking for salt packets and ketchup. After being asked to pull up to Mcdonalds waiting lot. I told my gpa, watch she's gonna be a snot and not put the salt packets in.After 5 minutes our fries come out.. With of course intentionally no salt. My reasoning for the no salt my Gpa eat it.. But I can. So he eats his with no salt and I have mine with it. A little FYI for the Mcdonalds drive thu cashier, it's your job honey it's honestly not that complicated.
