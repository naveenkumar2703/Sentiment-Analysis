1	Sigh.  This place was boring 15 years ago, and it's still boring.  Do they EVER get different inventory?  I don't even like going in there to look around anymore because of the creepy salesman watching me. Oh, and their return policy is a big turn-off too.
4	Well that other review is a bummer, so here I am to help out.My boyfriend and I came here because he was in the mood to buy new shoes. A loyal Chuck Taylor wear-er, he was pleased to find many, many styles of Chucks. Sadly, not a lot of those cool styles had his size. The employee was super helpful in letting him know what styles they did have in size though, which was nice. My guy wanted to try on some classic black hightops, and the guy brought them out super fast.It was a match and we checked out. I will say he spent $52, which I thought was a lot, but I never buy new shoes, so maybe it is standard.
1	Stopped by to pick up a new pair of walnut Blundstone boots. Was informed that they only come in black and stout(almost black). Proceeded to order said walnut boots off the Internet instead, since they do make them and saved $50. This is why local businesses are going broke, agree with the other reviewer that this shop was boring.
