1	If Yelp could let me rate this storage facility zero stars, I would go lower.Staff named ROSA is not friendly and helpful at all. After we got a notice about a price increase, we contacted the local store because we saw the same unit size on their website is 20$lower (with a free first month!), and we wondered if we can keep the same price as before. Ms ROSA told us they could not control the price and that promotion price for an existing customer, and that we can rent smaller size unit for lower rate (People may not know they actually need smaller size). They seem to not care if you cancel or not since they have so many customers. What friendly and helpful suggestion is!!!!! Called Extra Space corporate customer service and heard about the local store can adjust price as they want. The local store is choosing to both lose a customer and give the whole accompany yet another bad name.  Read more reviews about Extra Space as a whole, it's always the same story- the rate will increase, and they turn a deaf ear to you.  Way to go on the customer service.  I will not ever choose this company again, whether locally or anywhere.I will NOT recommend this store to my friends. Such bad customer service .
