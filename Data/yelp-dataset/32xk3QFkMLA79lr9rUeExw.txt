5	Tech 4 Life sent a technician to my friend's house in Carefree when her computer was frozen by a nasty virus.  The tech guy was efficient and polite, and not only eradicated the virus, but made sure that the virus protection program was up to date, the backup program was running properly, temporary files were deleted, and the disk was cleaned up.  The price was incredibly fair.  If you live in the Carefree area and need technical support, give these guys a call!
5	Tech 4 Life is very good at what they do with all things computer related and I just wanted to thank Steve for the consultation today. He is a great resource for home and business computer systems and reasonably priced. He knows his stuff. We are lucky to have Steve and his team up here in Cave Creek & Carefree.
5	Great and quick service! Had a computer virus that Jesse fixed in an instant, and calmed me down in the process too! Would recommend them to anyone!
2	I tried and tried to reach out to them to have them assist with a simple issue, but it was nearly impossibe to get them to call us back. My parents live in Cave Creek and needed some help so we tried to use these guys because they're local.  Fortunately for them they must be really busy because we called several times and only received one call back.  Steve left a message for us, and we literally called back just a few moments later and it went to voicemail again.  Anyhow, after not hearing back we were forced to call the Geek Squad and they helped us out.  Just a thought...  This is an area where many of the residents just want a live person to answer.  Just a bit old fashioned I suppose.
