5	Very impressed with Rebel Pools. Jason is easy to get a hold of and does a great job for my rental house in North LV. Although I live out of state, I know I can count on my pool guy to do what I pay him to do. I had an awful experience with another local pool company, when I was referred to Rebel Pools, who came in and fixed what the other guy ruined. I have been using them for a year now, and I couldn't be happier!
5	Good Service is such a hard thing to find lately.  However, Rebel Pool & Spa wins the prize for going above and beyond consistently with excellent customer service and follow through.  Having made the decision to install a pool is one thing but to be able to have our investment always look perfect is what Rebel Pool & Spa has done for us.Thank you Jason and Dennis for taking care of us.Rosalie & Tom High
5	It was an emergency situation that left my Father's beautiful Summerlin home in shambles. My husband and I did a lot of the day-to-day things around the property. But when it came to the pool, we were clueless! The pool, unfortunately, became green and needed some attention asap. I found Rebel on Yelp and with one call Jason was able to offer me a great deal for month to month service. He came out the next day and got right down to work. He was very knowledgeable about our pool and spa and knew exactly what needed to be done. Within a day our pool looked dramatically different. Within a week the pool was clear and ready to go..you would've never have guessed what the pool looked liked just 7 days prior. I'm very pleased with the service I was provided with and I definitely recommend them!
5	Jason is a true professional.  Excellent, old-fashioned customer service is not dead.  He cares, shares his abundance of knowledge freely, and is quite personable.  My pool has never looked more inviting, and I highly recommend him to all.  Thank you, Jason!
