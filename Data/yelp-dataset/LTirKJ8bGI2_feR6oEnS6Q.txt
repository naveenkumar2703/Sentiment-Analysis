5	I had my taxes prepared by Arlint CPA last year and received fantastic service.  Mr. Arlint graciously scheduled me for a free office consultation on short notice, and was able to answer all my questions.  My documents were prepared on time, and Mr. Arlint was able to get me a bigger return than I had expected.  I found my experience using Arlint CPA to be very good, and will be using them again next year.
5	I just booked an appt to get my taxes done for 2011. Cort did my taxes last year and I got the biggest return I have ever had. He was super nice and made sure to follow up with him this year. I also like the fact that he is a CPA because that means he really knows how to get you the best return possible, well worth the money.  Thanks Cort, I'm looking forward to my  next tax return.
5	Every once in a great while you have to rave about a business or service.  I saw Cort yesterday for my FREE consult.  The IRS can be very stressful, I must say he put me at ease.  There wasn't a single question he wasn't able to answer (believe me I wrote a list there were so many).  The gal at the reception desk made a great initial representation with her personality as well.  Thank you again.  There are only 5 stars...I give this business a 10!!!
