3	I stayed at this place while attending a conference. The location is very good just off Hwy 8. Ample parking space. The check-in process was really efficient. I was offered an upgrade although I am not a very frequent user of their program. Complimentary aps coupon as well! I was happy that they offered an eco program which is linen change by request or every other day . The front desk also offered various dining options in the area and actually suggested a spot to move my car in the parking lot as it would be closer to my room! The reason; the hotel is sprawling! It's good exercise to walk to your room. The room was neat and tidy. They have a pretty decent bar and The breakfast was good too. I am very impressed with the Holiday Inn. They are very comparable to the Marriott courtyards. Impressive for a budget hotel. Good job people!
4	Not a bad place to stay. I will have to give Holiday Inn for upgrading and keeping their hotels updated. We happened to stay here with the family given that they had stayed here before.  Nice hotel - the rooms were very nice and clean. The bathroom was very spacious and the floors were heated too!! I almosted died!!  When I told my aunt (that was staying across the hallway) that they floor was heated, she jokingly said that she wanted to spend the night in there!!  Who wouldnt given that when we arrived in Kitchener (mid week) to stay, the temperature was 5 degrees. We ate in two of their restaurants and the service was okay. Their main restaurant didnt have the breakfast buffet available given that there were only 40 people staying in their hotel that night. Yeah, that made for terrible table service from one person that had to wait on not only our two tables (10 people total) and the other 3-4 with other guests. Now why doesnt this Holiday Inn offer free breakfast in the morning?Anywho ... next time if we are in Kitchener again, we will definitely consider staying at this location!
