4	This location is actually a call center for them.  However, they have one guy on site who does windshield repairs.  I made an appointment and brought our vehicle in for a simple rock-hit repair.  The guy finished it relatively quickly (less than 20 minutes).  The impact site is still visible, but its appearance is much reduced.  Which is what I expected.  If you didn't know it was there you might not notice it.  And the resin they use insures the windshield won't crack further from that site as often happens with damaged glass.Yes, I would come here again.
5	One of the great things I love about this company is that they don't harass you like those smaller operations do.  "Oh you offer a week cruise to the Bahamas which will never ever work with my schedule... No thanks keep your cruise I'll stay with safelite" They were very professional, arrived on time, and were very nice.  This is the second time we have used them and we won't use any one else; sorry to the other companies-- your gimmicks and continual harassment has run its course.
3	I gave it three stars ONLY because it was tough to understand where to go. Its a call center and I kept seeing people flash badges to get in so it confused me and I didn't know where to go. Finally after driving around I found three small spots labeled guests parking. Service was good and repair looks great though!
