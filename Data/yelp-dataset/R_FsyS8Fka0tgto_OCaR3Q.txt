4	This was not as easy as it looked!  Twisted my ankle at mile 4 -____- had to pace myself the rest of the race. The venue was okay not too many muddy obsticals as the spartan sprint. Damn tough mudders! But overall it was a great challange accomplishment.  To all you who participated and finished, good job and good work! Beat is next, Here we come!! AROO!!!!!!
5	This was my first Spartan event and I have to say that it was Awesome!  The course was real challenging and rocks became my best friends.  I must have carried rocks in my shoes from the start of the race til the 8 mile finish!  The event was extremely organized and everything was marked well for new comers to find their way around.  I ran in the volunteer heat opting to stay 8 hours after my race to help out.  It was great working with other volunteers from other surrounding states.  Overall I recommend this event to people needing a fresh challenge in their lives.  Bring coconut water, hydration pack with plenty of water and power chubbies for the extra energy during the race.  It was also very useful to have Icy / Hot cream after your race because I cramped up real bad after the race later on in my hotel room!  Bring a friend to help tend to your battle wounds afterwards and for moral support!
