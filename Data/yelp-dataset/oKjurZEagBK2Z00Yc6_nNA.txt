5	I swear I find the cutest fedoras in the most random places.
4	I like this CVS better than the one on Trop and Jones. The pharmacy has NEVER screwed up my prescriptions, and just this last week, I needed help picking a cough medicine (OTC) and the pharmacist was very kind, and took lots of time to explain what the difference was between the 3 I brought up.  She chatted with me about comfort food, and told me to feel better.I generally don't get service like that at other locations.
2	I get all my prescriptions here,  only because its close to my house and also on my way to work, iIt is pretty nasty and worn down in there!!! It's dirty and old, hinky people walking all over the place.  I always feel I have to watch my back in there.  The customer service is nill.  They dont have any type of selection.  But, the pharmacy is ok, my meds are always done and ready on time.  Other then that this place is just weird.  Needs a major make over.
