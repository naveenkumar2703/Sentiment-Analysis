5	Used this cab company a couple of times on a recent business trip to waterloo.  Was pleased with the service and the cleanliness of the taxi.  Pickup time was fast and drivers were friendly and helpful.
5	I love this company. The fare to the Toronto airport is only $10 more than taking the shuttle.
1	I have used this taxi company about seven times in the last year when visiting my girlfriend in waterloo, and have almost every time been severely disappointed. The service is by no means great, the cab's do not arrive on time when specifically requested, & every time I use this company it seems to get more and more expensive for the exact same distance. The first time I called Waterloo taxi, it took them twenty minutes to pick me up from the train station, when told it would be a maximum of ten and cost me well over the estimated price to get to the University Of Waterloo. The next several taxi rides got increasingly expensive as it seemed the driver would take a longer way than necessary or a different route than previously taken that  would actually get me to the station on time. To top it all off my girlfriend used Waterloo Taxi cab again tonight to get to the train station and the service was TERRIBLE!!! This company made her miss her train (70$), take a cab to the Kitchener VIA station and back to waterloo (40$), and she will have to be making the trip again tomorrow, another (20$) taxi ride. They have completely lost our business & we will be using a different taxi company from now on. I highly recommend using a different taxi company when in Waterloo.
