5	This is the place to go for your paintball equipment needs. Julie is extremely knowledgeable and gives great advise. Their prices are very competitive.
5	My son and I went into this shop after he recently got interested in paint ball. He was looking to spend his Christmas money on a paintball gun after doing some research. I myself know nothing about paintball so I was relieved that Julie took the time to explain the different guns to us as well as taking quite a bit of time to explain how to clean and take care of the gun after the purchase. She treated my 12 year old like a real consumer even before he decided to purchase. Some small businesses frown upon younger customers it seems at times but she was super friendly and informative. I can't comment on the pricing due to we have not shopped around but he walked out of there spending a little over a 100 with a great starter gun. They had quite the variety, in stock, and the shop was very clean. She also gave us free passes to Tempe Paint Ball. We will def be using Dark Star for all of our paintball needs.
5	Julie is awesome.  I stopped by yesterday to refill my air tank and she went way beyond the level of customer service I expect.  She noticed several things wrong with my gun and completely took it apart, cleaned it and made it new again.She really takes the time to help the customer, you can tell this isn't just a job, but a passion for her.
