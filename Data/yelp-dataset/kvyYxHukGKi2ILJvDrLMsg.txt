4	On a nice sunny day, spend your afternoon lunch here!  This place is remote (on a golf course) and overlooks a nice open view.  With comfortable dining outside with misters to keep you cool on a hot summer day you will have the resort getaway feeling without the large vacation bill.  Try the nachos for a starter.  Well priced hot and cold sandwiches.  I had the enchiladas and they were very tasty.  Only serves breakfast and lunch.  Also, you can get a coupon on restaurant.com for your first visit.
3	I don't really consider myself a Golf Club kind of Gal. Never been turned on by the clothes, the men or the sport in general. That being said I chose The Raven simply because of the close distance to my house. We sat outside on the patio and the view of whatever hole we were sitting in front of was great.  The weather outside was gorgeous,  our waitress was super sweet and the food was pretty decent. I ordered the chicken club, and while not the most delicious one I have tried it was decent enough to warrant a second visit should I be in the neighborhood. Luckily for me I live within walking distance so I may just visit again. My date ordered chicken fingers, no surprise there, they were decent and he enjoyed them. Apparently they do a great breakfast/brunch too so I'm sure I'll have an updated review to follow.
1	What happened to The Raven Grill?!  Dining rooms half full early Sunday evening and all as-yet-unseated guests were directed by a manager to wait outside because they were "out of menus".  Once seated (one of three parties in the entire room) we apparently were invisible to the only waiter working the room. After just over 15 minutes of being completely ignored we simply left, but not before overhearing the phantom waiter tell a neighboring table he couldn't serve their drinks as ordered because "the blender broke this weekend". Verrado is too far a drive to risk another dining disaster -- we won't be back.
