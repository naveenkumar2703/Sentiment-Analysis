4	I sit at a desk all day looking in a microscope, for many excruciating hours at a time. I have a crappy, cheesy, and extremely uncomfortable chair that was temporarily made tolerable by some cheap lumbar support thing I found at Staples. Well, that POS lasted only two or three months before the strap broke, leaving me high, dry, and achy.Once again on the prowl for a way to ease my desk-driving pain, I remembered this little store next to AJ's, after finding no acceptable options at Tar-jay or Staples. Relax the Back had a somewhat mind-boggling array of lumbar supports, as well as a friendly freshly-scrubbed guy ready to help me pick one out. Five minutes later, I left with a very nice item -- nice and quick, no muss, no fuss. Fabulous!I'm only taking one star off because the stuff is somewhat pricey, but  since the products actually work the way they're supposed to, it's worth it. Ahhh.....
5	I'm a big fan of some of things they carry but the 5 star review and reason for finally putting up a yelp was the service. Both the salesman and owner really went out of their way during and more impressively after our fairly large purchase. We had a minor problem with a loose cord and they came right out and fixed it the same day I asked about it. Any questions I had were answered immediately. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. We love our zero gravity chairs and the dreamwave massage chair continues to blow away every guest that has tried it at our house. If I could do things over we'd replace our theater seats with their stuff in a second.
