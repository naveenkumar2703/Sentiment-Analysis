5	Can't believe what great customer service I received. Very nice management.  The best prices in town. This storage business is well kept. .What else can you ask for?
5	we had originally reserved a unit at another storage. we called and set everything up to be moved in on 5/26 which is Memorial Day. when we arrived at the storage place, we noticed the doors were locked with a sign saying they were closed for the major holiday! what?! we just called the day before and they said they'd be there. luckily, LifeStorage down the street was open. we explained to Ashley, the manager, about our unfortunate run in with the previous storage rental and she was more than happy to help us! she offered a 50% off for three months promotion, which we declined because we weren't sure how long we'd need the storage. but guess what? she offered 15% off anyways and our unit came out 30$ cheaper than the one we reserved before! how awesome is that? their availability hours are really reasonable even though they aren't a 24 hour facility. Ashley made sure we understood everything and went over each detail. she even recommended a place where we could get a u-haul to move everything. anyone that needs a storage, this is the place!
