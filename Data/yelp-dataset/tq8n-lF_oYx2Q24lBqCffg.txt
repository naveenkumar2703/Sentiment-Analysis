2	My husband and I had to get some paperwork notarized.  Had a bit of a wait.  2 people there, but one was in the back working.  We wait for our turn, get our papers notarized and then move on to purchase stamps and a money order.  $2 for ONE money order and $1.50 for 2 stamps. LOL  And to top it off, when I asked how many stamps I will need to mail a greeting card to Canada I was told one first stamp class would work.  Ummmm no.  It turns out, after doing my own research it is going to cost more.  So sky high prices and inaccurate information = not going back.  It's too bad Goin' Postal up the street closed.  That place was great.
1	Customer Service sucks at this location. On the phone and in person. They are always cutting you off when you speak, like they know it all. I switched to Fedex. They have great customer service!
1	Some old guy thinks he knows everything. I went there to get my dependency form notarize. An old,black guy claiming to be retired marine have no respect, arrogant, and racist. I tried to explain him what the form for, but he wont listen and thinks he knows everything. He knows nothing and i will never go to this place again. Worst and disrespectful customer service.
