4	Extremely friendly staff that assisted me with my gift needs this year, and offered to find an out of stock item at another location.  Good selection of products in the store itself, and the parking wasn't so bad.  Easy to find location that is visible from Bell Rd. itself.  They have sauces and such too, not just the basics of barbeque equipment.
3	Went in here on a Sunday just before Christmas.  The one previous time I had been here was about 10 years ago.  This trip was for a digital probe that I just had to have on a Sunday and I figured correctly they would have one.  The store is clean and well laid out.  The staff was helpful and knew exactly where to find what I was looking for.  The only downside is the place is not cheap.  I paid several dollars more than suggested list price for my purchase.  But what is a guy to do when he decides he needs a probe after he had already applied the dry rub?
