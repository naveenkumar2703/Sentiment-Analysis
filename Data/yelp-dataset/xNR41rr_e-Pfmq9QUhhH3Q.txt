1	DEAR YELPERS, BEWARE!  in my recent trip to vegas, i got ripped off to pay whopping 28 bucks for two small gelatos at this gelato stand in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace called Della Spiga Cafe. (located near the FAO Schwartz store) they would first lure you by offering you one free sample after another. then, they wouldn't show the prices until you got to the cash register. all the menu items on the wall were not listed with prices.This scam is also reported in the Las Vegas Review-Journal. http://www.lvrj.com/news/8781542.html
3	My wife said the gelato here was the best she's ever tasted. All I know is after selecting the child's size (not the small size, mind you), we were out a whopping eight dollars. And that's eight dollars my wife could have given away on video slots. Alas, such is Vegas.Note: I checked out a few places that served gelato while we were in town, and the flavors they offered were rather lackluster. Not a Stracciatella to be found anywhere. While it probably shouldn't have been surprising (this was Vegas, after all), the gelato idealist in me was a tad disappointed.
1	When I got to the register I thought I had broke a window. There were no prices on anything when we walked up to the counter. I should have walked away because I'm the biggest loser. Fifty three bucks for 2 frickin scoops. I am going to frame the receipt. This is where I got screwed in Vegas.
1	DON'T EAT HERE. My regular size gelato with 2 flavors cost $14 DOLLARS. Are you kidding me? DON'T EAT HERE.
1	Normally I don't give bad reviews but this place was... HORRIBLE!!  The mintue you walk through, the server's are offering you to sample of the gelato.  So I figure, wow they're nice trying to offer you samples.  There are no prices displayed until you get charged at the register, for $15.00 for a REGULAR cup (Which is really a small).  So no wonder they want to offer you sample, b/c they want to rip as many people off!!!!!  They tried to offer me the mid-size cup which thank God I did not get b/c it was $30.  The gelato tasted okay, nothing special.  Again this is a horrbile place, if you want gelatos go to the bellagio or the ventitian.  I felt like s sucker!!
1	I have the same complaint about the pricing.  The way it is laid out, that you do not see the prices until they bring you around the corner....it is quite deliberate.  I know Vegas prices are higher, but it is gelato...miniature cup and spoon.  I can't complain about the gelato, chocolate mint was divine, but the scam left a bad taste in my mouth.
1	**1 Star for the Price**Never again will I pay $18 for ice cream/excuse me: g-e-l-a-t-o [at least I hope I never will]. I wish I had had the opportunity to read the Yelp reviews before my visit. They were definitely on point.I will say *kudos* to whoever is doing the marketing for Della Spiga. They know what they're doing not having the prices in an easy to read area. Yelpers, please learn from my gelato fiasco: never be afraid to ask the price of anything before you buy.**5 stars for the gelato** My three flavors of gelato were delicious. I think. Maybe I was just telling myself that because I spent almost half a gas tank of money on them!
1	It's true - the prices are CRAZY expensive here. We were looking for gelato, and stopped briefly at the Trevi Restaurant kiosk to get some, but there was a large group of women taking forever to decide what flavor to get and we were in a hurry, so we passed that up and ran down the mall to Della Spiga. The sign for the Trevi gelato said $6, so I figured the Della Spiga couldn't be *that* much more. Boy howdy, was I wrong. We ordered two mid-size gelatos and two bottled waters. The total? FOURTY THREE DOLLARS. I almost spit my gelato out on the cashier. Seriously, wtf? It was good, and it comes with a huge piece of dark chocolate and a cookie, but COME ON PEOPLE. The prices guarantee I will never go there again, and I almost feel like organizing a boycott. Never, ever, go here. For any reason.
1	DO NOT COME HERE.  IT'S A SCAM.  There are so many better gelato places with more reasonable prices.  There's Trevi right in the middle of the Forum Shops, there's Payard right in Ceasar's as well near the Palace Tower, Cafe Gelato next door at Bellagio, and Cocolini, a short walk away at Venetian and Palazzo.   SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!
2	So yeah the gelato is good.But $8.00 for a CHILD SIZE small ass scoop good? Hell to the NO. However...the irony here is that while all the reviews here read the same about ridiculously exhorbitant prices, let's face it. When you are out randomly walking around in the Forum Shops at Caesars and spot sparkly shiny gelato winking at you....you are not going to think to check Yelp. Or you might, but I would venture to say most won't.So unfortunately, in a spur of the moment kind of purchase like this, all the 1 and 2 stars in the world on this place won't save a line of 20 people paying $8.00 for gelato. It didn't work for me...and yes there was a line.Random note to those planning to check out Vegas... remember to check the price of something first, before you let your visual sweet tooth steer you into a ridiculously expensive treat. Or just walk away when they say 'eight bucks please'.
3	OMG they had the best banana foster gelato ever except it was $7.99 for  small child size!! Yes that is crazy I spent that much but it was there so I just went for it.  I could have walked away but it was the last day so whatever! So glad it tasted good!
1	My wife and I met a friend at Caesar's Palace. Since it was a warm day, we thought it would be a good idea to have some ice cream. He suggested that FAO toy store had some ice cream. When we got there, they apparently closed. We saw  the Cafe with a nice window display of their gelato deserts. They even let you sample any of the flavors. After deciding on the flavors, I bought 2 mediums and 1 small. I asked where to pay and was directed to go to the other counter. Since I needed some change, I decided to break my $100 bill. Got to the register and was surprised to see my total add to over $54!!! The pricing was a small sign next to the register. I should have kept the receipt, but was so angry that I threw it away. The $5 one scoop ice cream in Maui (previous vacation) was a bargain!
1	I wish right now I had zero stars for this overpriced fool you into the web of sweet cream!!! I should of looked at my YELP application on my i-phone before being lured over by a "free taste". Dirty four letter word: FREE. My A$$ FREE with two small double scoops being $36. WTF? No way was I or my hubby going to pay that. We walked away with them paying for being such scammers. I understand I was in a tourist trap high end shops type of mall, but come on ICE CREAM/Gelato being more bucks then the booze slushy? At least with the booze slushy I have a nice buzz!!! DO NOT BE THE LICKER of the moment for these CIty Slickers of  ripping you off.
1	There should be a negative star rating, but what the heck, one star for the adrenaline rush of dining & ditching (not really - didn't take possession).  The elaborate decoration on top of the mounded gelato should have tipped me off - it's not selling.  In Italy, the most perfect displays of pizza were the worst tasting, but we were never disappointed by  the famous gelato shops we sought out.  So expectations were high even though the free taste was just so-so.  My son and I ordered anyway - I chose a dish the size of a large frozen yogurt, and the older Asian server suggested the smallest size for Hostage Gastronome Jr. - perhaps because we are Asian, and he knew we were in for a nasty surprise?  We rounded the corner to the register, and luckily someone else was ahead of us (probably not buying gelato) so that I saw the price sign - $25 for my dish alone!   I wasn't in so much shock that I couldn't see the my future as the greatest dupe of all time if I bought this.  The horror was too much to bear, so I just turned to H.G. Sr., and said, "Let's walk".  He likes to embellish that I started shoving him in the back, but I tried to be nonchalant as cries of "Excuse me!" hit my inwardly cringing back.  Then we had to pass a mall cop on a Segway - well, if he came equipped with wheels, why not a radio to alert him to gelato ditchers?  I was already justifying that this must happen all the time....$25?!!!....did they mean euros?...no that's going the wrong way and would be even more....just don't turn around...  My son ducked into the Apple Store, I thought to elude captivity, but just to check his Facebook and beg for an I-touch.  I stilled my racing heart and indignation at the aquarium, taking photos of the darling pufferfish, but there was only one way out....  Luckily the stand is in the middle of a wide, circular area of the Forum Shops, and a group distracted the mall cop by shouting, "Hey, it's Paul Blart!"  Well, I don't know why I'm acting like the guilty one...I don't recall being told I was ordering gelato sprinkled with gold flake jimmies.  This place would have better luck next to the casino where a drunken gambler could plunk down his winnings on a large gelato instead of a Rolex.
1	are you f'ing kidding me?  20 bucks for a cup of ice-cream?????
1	Should've know when I didn't see prices on the menu.  Apparently, the magarita booth is also owned by the gelato company.  I ordered a margarita and it came out to $17.....I was so shocked, I realized I should've just said $17 bucks? FORGET IT! and run off.  THEN I realized...the margarita had no alcohol at all.  I paid $17 for ice and strawberry syrup.
1	I am so thrilled there is almost a unanimous chorus on here of "DON'T DO IT".  They SHOULD rename this place "MOB Gelato" or "Godfather's Gelato".  The prices are no joke HIGHWAY ROBBERY. I had a cup of this stuff - Mid Size I believe - $15 smackeroos.  Now to be fair, contrary to the other poster, they do clearly have menus, but they are white menus with black lettering in the middle, NOT convenient to see near the gelato.  Yes it was good, but NOT THAT good. OH OH and further, even though this place is a convenient place to sit for you wifi laptoppers within range of the Apple Store's signal, FO-GET ABOUT IT because the mean-ass owner will chase you away if you spend more than 10 minutes there eating and surfing.  "We dont-a givuh people here morah than 10 minutes - scram".  Hey pal - F you and your gelato scam.  You charge THAT much?  I'm staying there for 3 hours!!!!!Please go there and if you buy anything, just buy water and refuse to move for as long as possible.  This guy  deserves sit ins to get in his face and make him lose money.Update: The AHOLE Godfather who owns this place is Gerry Shlesinger, article here: http://www.lvrj.com/news/8781542.html.
2	WTF?!?! $11 for a single scoop of gelato?  I was going to order the Medium for $7.99 only to find out that it is only for kids so I had to order the Regular for $9.99.  Being the sucker that I am for ice cream, I went for it anyway *sigh*  But it was the best pistachio gelato I've ever eaten if that makes it any better...super creamy with lots of pistachio bits running through it.  I also sampled the creme brulee one and that was pretty good as well.  However, definitely not worth $11.  Good thing is that they have four gelato displays so you don't have to wait long for your sweet treat.Tip: If you're craving gelato, head on over to Sugar & Ice at the Wynn - ginormous portions for $5!
1	Never again, just avoid it, I felt like I was ripped off.  Of course I only have myself to blame for that.
1	Holy SH..t I just got a walletectomy.....$97,61 for four ice-creams....after ordering 3 VIP ice-creams and a Gladiator then stepping up to the register to pay, instant brain frezzzzzzzzzzz. I am still trying to figure out how the One hundred dollar bill got out of my wallet,and into the hand of the gloved clerk???? 10 seconds later when sitting at a near by table and recovering from my brain frezzzzzzz realizing not only was I ripped off but my kids were devouring $16 dollar ice-creams, and i was sitting with a $45 dollar CESAR... Now that my head was clear, I just realized my hotel room  at the Flamingo Hotel was cheaper and so was the total gas bill for my drive from Ca.... reluctantly I started to eat this ice-cream, at that moment I had a glimmer of hope that CESAR himself would appear and spoon feed me this incredible treat and would kneel down and wash my feet, making the price seem halfway OK, well that did not happen, only to realize my nauseating experience made the ice-cream taste like SH....t  10 min later I force-fed my 2 kids the 3 $20 dollar Oreo cookies that were left on my plate, I could hear myself saying eat it! eat it....Never before have I asked my kids to lick there plates, well that changed, the ice-cream cups were licked so clean I figured perhaps the gloved clerk could re use them to serve the 3 idiots standing behind me who were about to be introduced to the brain frezzzz. the most humiliating part about this, Is later that day standing in McDonalds my 11 year old daughter had to point out..... look Dad, ice-cream only costs one dollar....Hopefully CESAR is rolling over in his grave.
1	On a recent trip to Vegas with my Boyfriend and his kids, we decided to hit the Forum shops and see the most famous toy shop in the World...( being there really isnt much to do in Vegas with an 8 and 12 year old.)...What a fantastic toy shop , we could have stayed in there for hours and played but thats really not the point, infact we should have stayed in there for hours and gone on a shopping spree...it would have been cheaper than going outside to the Gelato stand!!!Anyway my mistake, we walked out of the toy store and saw what appeared to be a Gelato and pizza stand.....the kind where you just swing in throw down a $5 and walk off with a happy kid...hmmmmm........so we walk up and sample a few flavors...the little girl settles on strawberry, which it what she just about always settles on...they show us the sizes...she wants a medium looking one....I get a child size and can't even remember what flavor because what follows is worse than a colonic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They then tell us to move around to the cash register, they ring up our 2 ice creams, and shock and dismay come over me as it totals $27!!!! For 2 F-N Ice Creams....I am flabbergasted , that somehow we hand over the money instead of telling them to stick the cups of gelato up their  A--holes.... only proves my level of shock!I am stuck looking at this child size super tiny cup of cold cream, and feeling like I just starred in an anal gang bang porn...I don't remember the gelato at all...I just remember telling Nicole ( the 8 year old ) that she better save her cup and maybe eat that too....and I don't even want to see a drip of gelato left in that cup...Was the Gelato good?How the F--k would I know when Im in a state of shock and really just want to return the damn thing and tell everyone standing near by that this place must be owned by a scam artist...The Forum shops should not allow this place to be in business....it brings them a bad name!!! Their are no prices posted where you order your gelato, and come on ...when is an ice cream over $7....I hate this F-CKing Place....I think it should be shut down....and their ice cream doesn't taste good because you got raped for it!!!!
1	This place is AWFUL, just horrific! I wish I never gave them any of my money!! If they weren't at such a prominent position, I really don't know how they can survive in Vegas given there is such good eats elsewhere. $14 for a cup of gelato, the smallest size available for adults. The server took the courtesy (ha!) to flatten the gelato so I only got the same volume as the cup. I've had gelati in Roma and for that price I'd have gotten 3 big cones worth. I wouldn't have been so mad if it was good gelato - but of course, it was very, very ordinary. Should have triggered something when they have flavors like Snickers and Reece's Pieces... as oppose to Tiramasu or dolce de leche.
1	Ever have the urge to give zero stars??  I loved the gelato, but the outrageous prices and the deceitful "upsell" techniques are despicable.  This place should be run out of town by the Better Business Bureau.  This operation is akin to a bait and switch scam as they don't even display prices and they hide the smallest sized cups unless you specifically ask for a smaller size.  This place is a forkin' scam people.  Stay away.  I could have had dessert with my dinner at Nero's FOR LESS THAN WE SPENT AT DELLA SPIGA.  WTF?  By the way, it looks like FAO Schwartz is going out of business anyway so there is no reason to head that far down in the Forum Shoppes.  Stay away people--and for chrissakes, don't let your kids get a glimpse of the enticing display of gelato goodness--unless you are prepared to apply for a second mortgage on the spot!
1	Place is a scam.  No posted prices, you can not order child size as an adult (understandable)  My family got a double scoop and it came out to $22!!!!!I thought the guy was mistaken.  No prices posted, and I don't care what the quality is of the gelato, those prices are insane.  This place stays in business because everyday unsuspecting tourists come across their very convenient location, only to be dumbfounded by the bait and switch techniques they pose on people.  You live, you learn, but fellow yelpers, let me tell you - - Stay away!
2	I have to admit the gelato was pretty good, but the prices are fkn ridiculous!  I didn't need more than the smallest size anyway, it hit the spot...but not too crazy about the fact that they are trying to rip people off!  Don't really remember how the service was, but now that I think of it... I remember I was pissed for some reason or another...I can't remember if it was cause I couldn't find my brother or if i was annoyed because of the price and service...
1	This place is good, but way overpriced. This place is a rip off. The prices aren't listed, they are extremely overpriced, and the service is not that great. The employees get you to upgrade and pay more for almost nothing, I do not reccommend this place & I will not come back. Way too expensive. I don't know how they stay in business
1	Okay. So after reading many reviews...I have come to one conclusion! You all are weenies! I am the ONLY person who got up to the cash register and refused to pay! Their argument: It had already been served. My argument: The prices weren't posted!The sample was good but not $37 good.Whomever owns this shop is definitely a SCAM ARTIST! His (or her) employees were all minimum wage Hispanic workers. Proving that they are out to find the cheapest labor possible just shows that the owners are out to rip off whomever they can. There are ethical ways to go about things and I don't believe anyone within that business shows this to their customers. At the very least, posting the prices would be more honest than not. It's now a joke between me and my husband and a good memory of the time we "almost" paid $40 for ice cream. Keep walking and you will find a few more ice cream shops with better customer service and a better bang for your buck!
3	I had the strawberry chunk and it was very, very, very, good, but very, very, very, pricey!!! Gheesh!
2	After reading the reviews, no one has written a review in teh past few years to update. They do now have pricings of their offerings. It isn't cheap or affordable, but it is, from what I have been reading, cheaper? then what it was. For the fancy cup gelato, it was $10. That isn't cheap, but first off, you're in Vegas, and you're in Ceasers. It comes with a 'souvenir' cup i guess, depending if you would like to take home a sticky dirty ice cream cup, but they're smart. I was there for a good 20 min, and saw people ONLY ordering that size. The small size was $8 but my mom wanted the 'bigger' one. I also had their pizza which was ok. Frozen pizza cooked right there. Not so bad but pretty pricy for the size. Can't remember how much. I'd give them a 3 star, but the 2 star is because their water is ridiculous! Who charges someone $6 for a bottle of freaking water? They don't even offer free water. WHAT? As far as the taste, it wasn't anything special, but it was good. Like someone else said, the pistachio was my favorite. Would I come back? If I ever had a little kid in tow, yeah probably get suckered into it.
3	Good gelato but thank goodness there wasn't a huge line this time. The chocolate mousse and hazelnut is highly recommended.
1	There is NO GELATO HERE!  I inquired about an ice cream shop and was informed about this gelato stand in the Forum Shops in Caesars Place.  Although it looks like gelato, it takes like freezer burned frozen yogurt.  Thankfully, I requested a sample first!  Also; after standing there in sheer disgust of the taste, I noticed the clerk handling this frozen heap of ice with his BARE HANDS - NO GLOVES or anything!
4	Not sure why there are so many negative reviews. Yes it's expensive but you are a tourist trap. I had the vip with strawberry mango and tiramisu it was good Gelato. Yes $10 for a Gelato fix is a little overpriced but you are in vegas..... Expect it. Lots of good flavors and they let you try everything. Next to. The statue show,  H and m
