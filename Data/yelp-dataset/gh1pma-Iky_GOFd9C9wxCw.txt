1	Explained the problem I was having with the granite in my shower. Requested for him to provide a free estimate. He basically refused to even come out and take a look to provide a visual estimate.  Came off as very rude and unprofessional . Find another company to handle your tile/granite repairs.
5	Awesome company!  Very professional, courteous, and friendly.  Great work  and very fast! will definitely use this company again!  If you use them you will not be disapointed!
5	WOW! Professional, knowledgable and helpful. This family owned business treats you like family! This was my first time getting someone who actually knew what they were doing to redo my whole kitchen. Backsplash, tile and granite countertops. THANK YOU, THANK YOU!! Call them today!
4	I had such a great experience with this company and will be sure to use them again for any of my tiling job. The owner was beyond sweet and took his time to answer all of our questions. No wonder they are the best in town.
5	We hired Flamingo Tile to remove all the horrible flooring from our 2600 square foot house and replace it with tile. It seemed too good to be true, but Shaley Moas quoted us $10,000.00 under the first company we called.  He helped select the tile and started the job the following day.  They brought a giant dumpster and hauled away all the old laminate, carpeting and tile.  They picked up and delivered the new tile themselves.  The whole job took a week - they worked 7 days in a row and did a beautiful job.  The workmanship is evident everywhere you look. Our whole house now has one beautiful tile throughout and it looks great.
