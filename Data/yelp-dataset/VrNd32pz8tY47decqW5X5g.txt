4	This is a nice place to bring your laptop for free wireless internet, but you can also buy time on the on-site desktop computers.  They serve coffee shop/smoothie shop type foods there- salads, sandwiches, pastries, smoothies, etc. with a nod to organic, healthy fare.  I've always found the place to be quiet and comfortable and the staff to be friendly. They play very interesting music, too.  It's open 24 hours.  The place is a bit small so when it's crowded you will have problems finding a outlet for your laptop.  I only had one bad experience there- some guy was obviously enjoying some porno on his laptop and I did not feel comfortable sitting near him. Other than that I've always felt safe here.
3	the drinks are ok ish. but if you need to use a computer this is the place to go. only one free hour of wifi for yourlaptop. used to be unlimited.
