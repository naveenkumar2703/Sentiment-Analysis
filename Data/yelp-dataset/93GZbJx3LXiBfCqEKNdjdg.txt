3	I've been curious about this place for quite some time. It's in the same strip mall as Fibber Magee's (SE corner of Dobson & Elliot) and just says "World Market" on the outside. I was inspired to finally pay a visit after watching Bobby Flay on Food Network win a Chicken Tikka Masala throwdown. I needed to collect some spices not normally kept in my cupboard to try to duplicate his recipe.The owner was completely friendly and helped me search their extensive spice selection for garam masala and black mustard seeds, but alas they appeared to be out. I did grab some basmati rice and plain yogurt however and peruse the store to take in their inventory of exotic ingredients. I would say that most of the items leaned more towards the Middle Eastern than the Indian variety, but I'm not that familiar with this type of cuisine.At least I know there is a nearby neighborhood market that I can check out for some interesting choices if I ever get inspired again. Looks like they have some pretty cool hookahs for sale, too.
