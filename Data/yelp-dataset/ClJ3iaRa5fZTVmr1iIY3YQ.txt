4	Just okay for Tropical Smoothie, but when you're in the Excalibur and looking for something quick, you're left with fast food choices.  This location is upstairs with the rest of their fast food restaurants.  I am a fan of the Tropical Smoothie chain.  My order is the same almost everytime...their Pesto Chicken Flatbread.  Service at this location is not bad, especially since most people up here are hitting up the McDonalds or Krispy Kremes.One plus...they are either open 24 hours or stay open really late.  I've been here after midnight and they are still open.
3	The chicken salad sandwich was great!  I could have done without the smoothie.  I expected it to be better since smoothie is in the name.  I had the Mango magic and couldn't taste any of the mango.  This is located in the Excalibur food court and a good alternative to the fast food places on either side.
3	The sandwiches are not all that great, but the smoothies are delicious. I could drink them everyday!
1	First meal coming to Vegas and I was craving a smoothie and decided to stop by here To grab a quick meal. Realizing that was one of the biggest regrets of my trip. Ordered a smoothie and Jamaican bowl. The Jamaican bowl was disgusting. Bland chicken with sauce that didn't taste like anything thing like Jamaican food. The smoothie tasted like a slurpee from 7/11 only 3x the price.
