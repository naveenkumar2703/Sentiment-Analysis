2	While the service itself is fine, the wait to schedule an appointment is not.  I called today (mid April) to schedule a cleaning.  They have nothing until mid-August.  Unacceptable.  After 10 years of dealing with this kind of scheduling issue, I've decided to change dental practices.
5	Thank you for finally making a dentist office that understands the needs of people.I have so much anxiety about going to the dentist and the assistant Rachel was so understanding.  Dr. Donnelly was fantastic.  They were honest and open with my dental treatment options.Friendly, well-organized, comfortable and clean.  They even gave me a reusable water glass! I think the green gift was very welcoming.
5	I cannot say enough positive things about my experience here.  I called yesterday in extreme pain with what turned out to be an abscessed tooth needing a root canal.  Even though I was not a patient, they got me into an emergency appointment right away and referred me to an endodontist to have the root canal a few hours later.  They were kind and compassionate to someone who has a lot of dental anxiety.  Also, I have no dental insurance and they were helpful with payment options.  Thank you so much!
1	I had work done in last couple years at MFDA, and unfortunately was not given informed consent. Both dentists told me they were filling my teeth with "silver." I've since come to find out that they actually used mercury.I've know about the dangers of mercury toxicity for years, and would never have consented to it being put in my mouth. I'm of childbearing age, and I am extremely concerned about the associated risks of mercury poisoning due to "silver" fillings.I've done much research on the subject, and have begun the very expensive process of removing these fillings. The dentists here in California are shocked to hear that mercury is still used, as it's very controversial and common sense alone tells us that putting a toxic metal in one's head could lead to serious consequences. Numerous scientific reviews agree (*see below for links), and even the UN is working to eradicate the use of mercury fillings.The team MFDA are all very nice people, and I hate to rate them so low, but this is a serious matter and I would love to hear that they change their policy to offer their patients informed consent. * I'm including several links about the dangers of mercury fillings:http://www.disabled-world.com/health/oral/dental/mercury-filling.phphttp://www.dentist.net/silver-filling.asphttp://www.naturalnews.com/007851.html http://iaomt.org/understanding-risk-assessment-mercury-dental-amalgam/http://www.zeromercury.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=254:governments-at-un-mercury-negotiations-urged-to-reduce-exposure-end-toxic-trade&catid=68:press-releases-2012&Itemid=82http://iaomt.org/state-department-considers-global-impact-toxic-dental-mercury/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ylnQ-T7oiAhttp://www.iaomt.org/articles/category_view.asp?intReleaseID=342&catid=30 (Sounds especially bad for pregnant women and babies. Linked to autism. "Norway, Sweden, and Denmark have banned the use of mercury fillings in dentistry, while Germany and Canada have limited their use for pregnant women,36 37 and France, Finland, and Austria have recommended that alternative dental materials be used for pregnant women.")If you want to remove mercury fillings, be sure to go to a dentist who is certified by the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology to remove them properly. If you replace them with resin, be sure your dentist uses the BPA-free resin. To your good health!
