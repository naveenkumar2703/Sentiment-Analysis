4	I come in here almost every morning for a smoothie and man are they good. I recently found out about the the pinkberry smoothie and I am addicted. The store is very clean and the staff are always friendly and helpful. After the pinkberry I love the blueberry bliss. They also make wheatgrass juice which is good for my workout. I simply love this place so much that I go almost everyday before work. Highly recommended.
3	CLOSED :( being replaced by a yogurt shop. Hope its good
1	the phone number is disconnected. and it looks like a new smoothie place has replaced this. it used to be next to as you wish, right? and it stinks cuz I have groupons that I intended to use at this location.
