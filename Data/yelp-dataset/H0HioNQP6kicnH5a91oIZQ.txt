5	This was my first cleaning after having my braces removed. I did not have the pleasure of this office providing my ortho care sadly... Perfect smile nun the less. Christine was willing to take the time to remove the remaining cement from my back teeth.I had a wonderful time in my chair as usual. Thank You
5	Being a single Mom and unable to find quality dental care, at an affordable price, has been excruitating to say the least. Most of my dental work was deemed "cosmetic" by my insurance company and other dentists in the valley wanted to charge me over $10,000 to complete the work. Not only did Dr.Randy cut that price in half but he gave me several options! I can't begin to tell you the level of professionalism I experienced at Encanto Dental Care. The staff is small and caring and most have been with Encanto for years, which in my mind says alot about the ownership.They have payment plans, through their office, and work with any type of financial situation. All procedures are done in house and with the low overhead you get EXCEPTIONAL treatment at a low cost.My search is over. After 8 years I finally found a dentist I love. Give them a shot, you will not be disappointed!!
5	Best dentist I have found in Phoenix... Very personable and helpful! Unlike the mega chains.
5	The best ever!  Dr. Nunley is very professional, yet personable and friendly.  His staff are unbelievable.  They really make you feel like family.I would highly recommend them.
