3	We've been to this subway a few times since it was across the street from my work office, so mainly because of convenience is why Ive been here a few times. The subs are normal subway sandwiches, however, I don't know if this is the norm here, but what is usually will pay about 6-7 dollar, they charged 9 bucks for the same sub i always get (double chicken breast on wheat). If I had a choice and if there were more food places nearby, I would most likely choose other place. However, I do know Subway has much more healthier food options.
2	Pretty same subs as every other location except they charge $2-3 more for the same thing. The staff was pretty stingy with the vegetables too. Save your money and drive 5 minutes to the mineral point location.
1	staff charge extra money  watch out ..!!
2	Agreed with other reviews... they try to nickel and dime you. I'm not sure if staff are told by management to be "skimpy" on the veggies, but they don't put a lot on. Then when you ask for more, I feel like it is a burden for them. Plus I feel like their selection of $5 subs are less then other locations (could be wrong because I haven't eaten at a subway in a long time). All in all, customer service is lacking to save a little money.
