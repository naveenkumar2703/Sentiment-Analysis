1	This place is always empty and with good reason. It's pricey, the guys are a bit skeesy and they do a terrible job! When they "washed" my car there were still dead bugs on the front....gross....and a plastic piece from the interior of my car was sitting on my passenger seat!! I asked where did that snap off from and why is it on my seat?? They replied with "I don't know".Mind you it's a new car and pieces tend not to fall off at random. It took three dudes but they finally figured out how to put it back on.....way to go car wash guys.
5	It's a little bit more pricey than some car wash alternatives, but the service here is second to none. I've had my car washed here a few times, but this review is for the window tinting service. The price was fair to remove old tint and apply new, darker tint. They threw in a $50 credit towards detailing my car, and since the inside hasn't really been cleaned in 2 years, I jumped at it.It took awhile, but there's free wifi. I spent the day sitting in the shop comfortably, watching movies on the TV, drinking good (and cheap) coffee, and playing poker. In the time I waited, I made enough money to pay for the tinting and the detailing, along with a couple of air fresheners and accessories :)I'd definitely recommend this place to friends. Definitely.
1	Expensively bad carwash.
5	I have been here a few times and they always do a great job!  The staff is friendly and the guys take their time and never seem to rush through the job.  They have a comfortable waiting area with a TV, wifi, and magazines.  You can also order coffee and gelato.
1	Really bad wash. Soap still on car and was still dirty. They barely have any scrubbers inside the wash its ridiculous. I should have just looked in the wash before I purchased wash. Never go here again. The car wash located in gas station has a more advanced wash than this place and does a much better job. No wonder this place is always empty.
