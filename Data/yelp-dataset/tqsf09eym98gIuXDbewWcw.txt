4	Stopped in this store on a whim, saw it while driving by.  So glad we stopped.Not only do they sell ice and water bottles that you can fill yourself, but they had a great selection of candy and snacks.  We got jawbreakers, sixlets, lemonheads and orangeheads!  I also found dill pickle flavored sunflower seeds.  They had a decent selection of different sodas from Jones, etc.They also serve Thrifty Ice Cream, Soft Serve Ice Cream, and Hawaiian Shave Ice.   The soft serve ice cream was terrific, and the chocolate dip had good chocolate flavor without being waxy and waxy tasting like I remember from childhood.The Shave Ice wasn't flaky like I remember it being when I had it somewhere else.  This was a cross between a snocone and shave ice.  They did have just about every flavor syrup you could imagine.I felt like a little kid when I left!
4	I must be a fan. This is the only place I go to get our water bottles filled. Real nice layout, plenty of facets for 5 gal bottles, friendly staff + ice cream. What isn't there to like.
