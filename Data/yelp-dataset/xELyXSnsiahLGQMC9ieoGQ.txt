1	If you're here for food/drinks/cigs/the usual convenience store stuff, you're fine. But NEVER BUY GAS HERE.This place DOES NOT have any sort of "lockout" on their pumps when they are being used by another customer, and this results in all kinds of problems if you come here to fill up your car. You insert your card and begin filling up like normal, only to have it stop prematurely. A salesperson comes out and tells you that you just pumped someone else's gas. Yeah, right. If the pump says "insert card" and there is no one parked there, to me that means no one else is using the pump.You then have to go into the building to pay for this, which is extremely time-consuming and annoying. And that isn't even the worst part.When you come back out to insert your card and fill the rest of your tank up, it WILL NOT ACCEPT YOUR CARD. This is complete bull, meaning you have to go to another gas station, and lose even more of your precious time.I have had this same problem THREE TIMES now. Even once would be unacceptable, but three!? I have finally complained about this on the company's website, so hopefully it will soon be a thing of the past. I have NEVER had this problem at any other gas station, not even any other 7-Eleven. Until this issue is for sure resolved, go get your gas somewhere else.
3	The worker who was working the day I dropped by for water and snacks was friendly and knowledgeable.This 7-Eleven is kept clean and I'm sure it has the same deals as other 7-Eleven locations. They have a gas station right outside which looks a little run down though.
3	I stop in here to get a coffee or donuts. The store is clean and the staff is friendly some of the time lol. The lines can be long in the morning with everyone else wanting coffee, donuts, and gas.The parking lot is odd shaped and it can be very busy at times making it hard to get a parking spot and when you do get one and try to leave it can be tricky getting out. The same goes for getting gas.
