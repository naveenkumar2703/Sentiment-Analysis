3	As far as post offices go...this place stacks up pretty well.  The staff has always been friendly and happy to help.  They do tend to get a bit busier towards closing time, but they do a real good job moving the line as efficiently as possible.  The only two downsides are, that this location isn't in the best part of El Mirage, and parking can be a bit of a challenge when they get busier.  The flip side of course is, how often do you really need to go to the post office nowadays???
5	Great, hardworking employees offer fast and friendly service. They are pleased to help with any inquiries and take their time, even if the line is getting long. The place is well maintained, with little to no trash lying about. The parking lot is tiny, and entering/exiting the parking lot can be a pain.
4	I wasn't aware that post offices could be reviewed on Yelp, but here it is. This place is great to send your mail, pick up your mail, and even get a P.O. Box. The staff are friendly and not in any hurry so you know that they will get your order right. As others have said (the two other reviews), the parking lot fits seven (7) cars (maybe nine [9] if you have a couple of those miniature cars) and the location is in a drearier part of El Mirage.
