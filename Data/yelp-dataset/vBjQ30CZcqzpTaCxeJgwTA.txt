4	John the owner took really good care of me and my car.  I'm so glad I went here instead of getting a $99 cheapie job.
1	Took our Accord here to get tinted.  While the tint color was as expected, we had some bubbles.  They did tell us to go back in 2 weeks if the bubbles didn't go away.  However, the tiny bubbles were not the biggest issue, the worst part of the tint is the back window - now we're seeing double out of the back window.  Not sure what happened, but I am sure that I don't want them to touch my windows anymore.
5	I had an easy time setting up my appointment. John said I could call the morning of and usually he'll be able to get my car done that day. He said it would take 1.5-2 hours, they were done in 1 hour 15 min, so that made me very pleased. He was clear on the pricing and after care instruction. He is a very knowledagble guy.
5	i have had several cars tinted as A Razors Edge and all have turned out fantastic.  i mistakenly took my mom's care to another place because it was closer and about $50 cheaper.  Boy did i get hosed.  the guy had apparently not being tinting long enough to really know what he was doing and the tint looked bad.  when i took it back he tried to blame my mom and i told him no that it looked like that from the start.  If you want a good deal go here.  if you have an issue like the one reviewer did, you should definitely take it back so that he can fix it as he has always told us that if there were any issues to bring it back and he would make it right.
5	Very great customer service with quick and affordable work. I would defiantly recommend Razors Edge to anyone!
