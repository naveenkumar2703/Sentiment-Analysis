4	Just got home from taking my dog to this location. I used to have to take him to the Ann location and am happy they have one closer to my home. They are a little expensive but they have a rewards program (however they didn't have cards at the time but was told that next time I go in I will get a double stamp). Did a good job and got done at the time they told me. Only thing I would have liked was if they had a little play area for the dogs to play in after they were done instead of sticking them in kennels. Also wish it was a little bit cheaper.
1	Took our Newfoundland here last week...after 6.5 hrs....apparently they weren't able to find how to trim one on Google...paid for furminator and didn't get it...maybe they're good with Chihuahuas....but don't recommend anything bigger than a Maltese going here...plus my dog was so stressed after being here, that she attacked our other dog, within 20 mins of being home( never happened before)....worst $80 ever spent....think I'll spend the $40 more for a trained groomer at petsmart
