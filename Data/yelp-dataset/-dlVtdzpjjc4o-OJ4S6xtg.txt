5	I love the oranges from The Orange Patch. Almost as good as the ones I used to pick from my aunts tree in Mesa, AZ. :) We usually get a box in January when the oranges are super perfect. Last year while on a road trip to AZ, we stopped in. Even in March the oranges were super yummy! They are super nice to work with and ship pretty much anywhere! Nothing like a bite of summer in snowy weather!
5	Orange Patch is very nice. Their oranges are to die for and the staff are very friendly. I will be purchasing fresh Arizona Citrus from Orange Patch for the rest of my life! These oranges are coming from trees that are over a 100 years old. Simply the best!
5	Of all the fruit stands in the valley this is the best.  The oranges are amazing!! This store not only has just oranges but lots for great local foods as well.  I highly recommend checking this place out.  Its well worth the drive if you don't live close by.  * helpful tip: The cost of the oranges, lemons, grapefruit and tangelos are very cheap.  The other food products are the same price as specialty stores  (excellent quality) you get what you pay for.
