5	I never write reviews, but I was so impressed with Lyndsy.  I called yesterday and she fit me into her schedule after hours.  She listened to what I wanted and I ended up with a hair style that she taught me how to manage.  The neck and hand massages made it feel like a mini spa day.  The prices are amazing for what you get.
5	This place is fantastic. Nicole and Lyndsy go out of their way to fit you into their schedule, listen well, take their time to make sure you're satisfied, and are willing to make your hair work with your actual level of daily maintenance, rather than giving you hairstyle homework. I go to Lyndsy, but would confidently go to either of them. The price is a solid deal.
5	I saw that the former Bohemian Bauble had turned into a tiny salon, and since I'd been thinking for some time about getting my terrible hippie hair properly cut, I took the plunge. Online booking made it easy for me to check my calendar. The salon feels uncluttered and relaxed.Co-owner Lyndsy greeted me as soon as I came in the door, listened carefully to my vague and probably completely unhelpful suggestions, then gave me exactly the cut I had been envisioning. I will be back!
