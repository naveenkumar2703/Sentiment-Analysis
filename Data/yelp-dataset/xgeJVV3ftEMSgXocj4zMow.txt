5	The pizza is amazing.  I love the deep dish stuff.  Don't ever tell me how many calories - but the stuff is amazing.Tried their salads and those were good too.  Typically, I say that most restaurants do one thing really well - however, they do many.
4	The double-decker Chicago-style pizza is a winner!  The sauce is fabulous and it's cooked beautifully.  Well done!
2	We decided stop in to have a slice or two.  The dining / waiting area was completely filthy.  The floor was covered with a variety of dead bugs and garbage and the two small tables were sticky.  I like their food at their other restaurants but will never go back to the Monona location.
