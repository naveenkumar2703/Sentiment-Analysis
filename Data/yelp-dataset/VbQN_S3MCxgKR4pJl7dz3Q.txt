4	I won a $100 gift card to this store last year. I really wasn't excited about it. I wasn't familiar with the brand  (and sizing for that matter) since junior high school. I require two different sizes. I am size 6/8 on top (thanks to genetics & swimming) and 2/4 on bottom. Finding clothing that fits me, is a challenge. Jeans are the hardest for me, by far. Add petite to the mix. (But I am able to fit the following: petite, misses, juniors, and sometimes children's clothing, depending on the maker/label.)I didn't really browse the clothing (mostly feminine career separates) at regular price- moderate. I went to the clearance sale racks, though. Imagine my surprise when I found some cute tops & bottoms. Since I wasn't familiar with the sizing, I grabbed a bunch of different sizes and went to the dressing room. What did I end up with? Two pairs of dressy shorts in navy and brown, four tops- a ruffled emerald green top, marine blue v-neck top, black tank with pretty design, and an orange basic top, plus a light aqua beaded necklace. I went over by $12. In other words, very pleasantly surprised. Now, whenever we're in the mall, I stop by and scan the sales racks- inexpensive.
4	I'm a fan of this store due to the clothes being professional. I always look on online for coupons or check my email for coupons. The first time I went in the store the girl refused to give me a discount because she wouldn't take my coupon off my cell phone. So I purchase my items and returned the next evening after class with more discount coupons. I had the manager price adjusted everything and I was able to receive my discounts as well as two free sweaters and a belt for free.
5	This place is the best. When it comes to women's fashion there is something for everywoman here. With a brand new store they're due to make some serious noise this year. My fav it is the staff. Very helpful, very genuine, and the prices are insanely reasonable.
