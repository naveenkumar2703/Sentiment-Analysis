5	My husband is an airman in the Airforce and needed emergency work done on his blues. Debra works out of her home but let me tell you this is no hinderance whatsoever on her outstanding work. Not only was the work done for a very reasonable price but we were able to have it done within a few hours. This woman is passionate about her work and without a doubt, she will do and amazing job on whatever you need to have done. I will be recommending friends to this place and taking my future business here.
5	Debra is AMAZING! One week before my best friends wedding (which I was the maid of honor in) I discovered I had gained weight and no longer fit into my dress. It was a floor length, all lace dress that every other place I took it to said there was nothing they could do. I brought it into Debra three days before I had to leave town for the wedding and she was able to change the zipper back to a corset back...in ONE DAY! The dress fit perfectly and it looked amazing. I still can't believe the quality work she did, and with such little time, too.Plus, while we were there, my friend had a dress in her car that she wanted to take in and Debra said she would have them both done the next day. And she did!She is super friendly, charges a fraction of what other places charge and loves what she does. I would recommend her to anyone!
5	I brought a pair of pants here and she perfectly hemmed them. I admit I was a little skeptical when I realized that she is running this business out of her apartment but don't let that fool you! She did an awesome job and I'll be sure to bring more items here when I need alterations. Also she is very affordable!
5	Deb is AWESOME!  She did a perfect job at HALF of what her competitors quoted...she also had it done in one day, her competition had told me it'd take a week!  Every time I wear the outfit she tailored for me I get tons of compliments!
