4	I have been here several times now.  Each time I've gotten a great pedicure and they have done exactly what I've asked.  The lady running the front desk can be a bit abrupt but she has also been nice enough to me.  The women that do the manis and pedis are all very pleasant and gentle.  I typically do a walk in and I have never waiting longer than about 10 mins on a busy Saturday.  The shop is clean and does not smell like chemicals like some nail salons.  I'm so happy this place is just down the street from me so if I need a quick polish change I can pop in. Prices are resonable too. If you live in the Chandler area give them a try.
