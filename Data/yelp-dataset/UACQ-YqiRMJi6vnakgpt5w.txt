5	The tour guide was incredible. He was very professional and gave us lectures on the area's history, botany, geology, and even some philosophy as we made the hour-long treks to and from the dam. I think his name was Michael. Anyways this wasn't some bubbly cliche-spouting bimbo but someone who had taken alot of time, concentration, and research into building a cohesive entertaining story for our drive. He isn't the only driver though, so I suggest you see if you can get him by name. Who knows, maybe the other guys are good too but Michael was excellent.The dam was great, and the brief stop at a chocolate factory for free samples was a worthwhile diversion. Instead of hanging out in the gift shop be sure to go to the big cactus garden outside for a nice sunny stroll before getting returned back to the grind of your local casino floor.
5	A smaller van picks up passengers all over the strip and brings them to the departure site at Miracle Mile. The tour bus is not overbooked so you'll enjoy the comfort of entire trip without having to worry about the overcrowding phenomenon, i.e. fight for oxygen or leg space.The driver is the tour guide; he was definitely knowledgable, very charismatic and entertaining. Along the way he gives history snippets, interesting stories, and fun facts about Boulder City and Hoover Dam. He touches on politics, and expansion, and how the Hoover Dam brought life to the west. It definitely brought out the inner patriot in me, and just made me fall in love with the United States of America all over again, forever and ever, and ever. At Hoover Dam, we were given plenty of time to explore. We took our time and still had plenty left to go souvenir shopping and take pictures all over the place. We got our package through a Vegas Power Pass, and it included access to the theatre wherein we saw a very cool simulation of the hoover dam processes. The pick-up location to leave is the same as where we were dropped us so it should not be a problem finding it. I love the little stop-over in the chocolate factory where there were free samples!!!!! There's also botanical garden next to it which is a really good place for photo ops. :DOverall, the hoover dam tour company took care of EVERYTHING from arrival to departure to ticketing to pick-up locations. It was very stress free, educational, and an opportunity every individual should experience.
5	If you want to do something for the day aside from the the Vegas strip, book a tour with these folks!On our recent trip to Vegas this past weekend we decided to take a tour of the Hoover Dam, so I researched companies for all of 2 minutes and decided to go with the Hoover Dam Tour Company and thankfully [and luckily] with my minimal research, they did not disappoint. First of all, their reservations team was very thorough and followed up with me several times [I had a busy week last week and was bad with returning missed calls], there was no way they were going to let my group of 4 miss our tour or any of the necessary details, and their diligence in getting ahold of me was most appreciated! The few staff members I spoke to as well were all very friendly. On the day of the tour you are picked up from your hotel by a nice little shuttle bus that brings you over to their main point at Planet Hollywood where you board a nice, large and comfortable tour coach. During the 50 minute drive down to the Hoover Dam, our driver and guide LaEva kept us entertained with interesting tidbits and facts, many of which were not your typical "touristy" things about Vegas, but rather info about the outlying areas, the industries there, average home and rental prices etc... She was also very thorough with the various instructions throughout the tour and never at any point were we confused or felt under-informed. In addition to touring the Hoover Dam, stops were made at two outlook points and the Ethel's Chocolate Factory [my favorite part!]. Upon arrival back in Vegas you are dropped back at your hotel, or one very close by should you choose to just walk a bit like we did. Thanks to all the staff at Hoover Dam Tours and LaEva, we had a great time!
1	OK so this tour was well organized they picked me up right on time and the driver who picked me up was very nice to bad he wasn't my actual tour bus driver. The actual tour at the dam was great because it is run by city/state workers who are professional and know what they are doing. However you are on a guided tour bus for at least an hour and it was horrible it was run by Steve who started off with reprimanding any "singles" that they must give up their seats to all couples because couples get priority. I thought that was very rude but it got better then he went on to tell us to turn off our cell phones and that we needed to be quite and not talk so that he could talk. He spoke to us as if we were riding on a kindergarten bus. But then it got even better besides his rudeness he also was speed talking and he had some sort of nasal issue and keeps slurping his mucus and hacking it literally every 60 seconds. It was disgusting it made me nauseous by the time I got there. He also went of script several time and repeated himself as well. He went on and on about how he was a chef and has traveled the world and about all the different places to eat and all about the chefs there and of course how he worked with them all. If this guy continues to be the driver/tour guide the company should look into investing into video's so people will not have to hear his disgusting nasal issues.
5	Just incredible a must see if you are in Nevada
2	We took the short tour and I'ma tell you the truth, while our tour guide was entertaining, the most interesting part was the 10 minute movie before the tour. I think you get access to parts of the dam that you wouldn't normally if you're just visiting the dam without a tour, but I'm still not sure that it's worth it.
4	The tour was great for the most part. The tour bus arrived on time for pick up and the tour guide was entertaining and funny. We actually got a tour inside the dam and got to see what goes on underneath it. There was a museum which shows how the dam was created. The tour was very informative and interesting. My favorite was walking across the dam. I have a fear of heights, so looking down was a problem! Part of the tour that I went on included a visit to a nearby chocolate factory. The factory was ok, there wasn't any chocolate being made that day, so I was kinda bummed. I did get a free sample though. But I felt the factory tour wasn't necessary. I would rather just visit the dam and nothing else. But I got a package that include other tours beside the dam. So if you want to visit the dam, either go on your own or try to get a tour where you just visit the dam.
2	I'm just reviewing the tour company not the actual dam tour. After reading other reviews I booked this hoping not to get Steve the bus driver. Oh man!! Our bus was driven by Steve & he is obviously not a great pick to operate a tour. He constantly coughs, snorts & swallows large amounts of phlem while speaking over the mic. I thought I was going to get ill. On top of the congestion he talks so fast the sentences all get slurred together & you can only pick up on certain words.I just closed my eyes & tried to zone out on the ride there so wouldn't have to hear Steve talk. I really wish I had just spent $20-$30 more & booked a better company.
5	We loved our trip to the Hoover Dam. We had a super awesome bus driver. I can't remember his name and it was not this "Steve" guy. Whoever he was, he was very entertaining the entire way to there and back. The bus was clean, and while it was packed with people I didn't get that airplane feeling. I won't comment much on the tour as this is a review for the bus operator. The tour was fun and it was amazing to see the iconic structure that is the Hoover Dam. Speaking of Dam, I loved all the "damn" jokes.
1	First, they pick up at only select hotels. I was picked up at a hotel not too terribly far from my location, but walking 15 minutes in the Las Vegas heat can seem too long. Then on the way back, my pick-up point was not an option as a drop-off point. I had to get out at another hotel that added some minutes to my walk back.I took the "premium express tour" which did not include two full hours at the dam as advertised. We were at the dam two full hours but most of it was spent at an out-lot because the driver didn't want to hassle with the other tour buses that came in before him. Therefore, I had about 45 minutes total to do all the things at the dam this company advertises. Clearly not enough time, as I barely completed the tour and had to leave. You literally didn't even have time for a bathroom stop before having to leave.For what I paid for the tour, I wish I would have rented a car and explored Hoover dam and Bolder City on my own.I would not recommend this tour!!!
1	If I could rate this lower than a single star, then I definitely would. Money NOT well spent, to say the least. I purchased two Premium Express Bus Tours from this company through Groupon a few months ago. Oct. 22nd is my parent's 29th wedding anniversary and my mother has been wanting to go on a tour of the Hoover Dam ever since I can remember. I thought this tour would be the perfect gift for their anniversary, but unfortunately my assumption was terribly wrong.    My parents do not go to Las Vegas very often because they do not know their way around so the hotel pick up option made them decide to plan their entire anniversary weekend in Vegas so they would not get lost. They were supposed to be picked up in front of the Embassy Suites Hotel on Saturday the 20th at 9:15 a.m. They went to the front of the hotel at 9:10 a.m so they would be there before their bus arrived to pick them up. They waited out front until 9:20 and no one had arrived. They asked the valet who was out front and were informed that the driver showed up at 9:08 and then left. So my parents would have still been left behind if they had showed up at the 9:15 pick up time. After they learned that the driver had left, they called the company and were told that the bus was to arrive at the hotel Planet Hollywood by 10 a.m. and to take a cab over there so that they could catch it. They were also told that they were called to see where they were, but my parents both had their phones with them and they had received no missed calls all morning. They were also told that when they arrived at Planet Hollywood that the hotel clerk would reimburse them for their cab fare; needless to say the hotel clerk had no idea what they were talking about. They arrived at Planet Hollywood at 9:45 and waited out front near the sign that said busses. At 10:10 a.m. no one had shown up and they called the company yet again. They were then instructed to wait at the entrance of the Miracle Mile Shops. My parents have no idea what The Miracle Mile Shops are, nor do they have an idea of where they are. My parents were also not given clear instructions as to where the entrance was and where the busses were supposed to arrive in front of it. After this whole rat race, it is needless to say that they were never picked up and never went on a tour of the Hoover Dam. They also had to pay a second cab fare to return to their hotel.   I do not understand why it is so difficult for a driver to wait until his pick up time to make sure that even early arrivers are able to get on the bus; especially when he had a whole 45 minutes to be somewhere else that is only 10 minutes away, maximum. If there is a scheduling error then this definitely needs to be looked into and corrected immediately. Sending my parents around the strip on a wild goose chase for a tour bus is very poor customer service, and by far the worst customer service I have ever heard of. Upon hearing that their driver made a mistake, and left before his pick up time, an offer should have been made to come back and pick my parents up; especially since he obviously had time to spare since he was ahead of schedule. My parents wanted a guided tour of the Hoover Dam that I had already paid for, not a frantic tour of the Las Vegas strip at their own expense that they had not planned for. After being left behind, without a care, my mother tearfully called me from her cab back to her hotel and informed me of her and my father's terrible experience with this company. She said that her anniversary was ruined.
5	What a fantastic tour guide! A much older gentleman that had a wickedly funny sense of humor! I mean, I laughed the entire trip, got lots of great information....and truly appreciated a "dam" good tour! I purchased my tickets through Groupon and had no problem once in Vegas redeeming them for my actual tickets. To be honest, it looked like over half of the people in line had Groupon!The tour guides at the Hoover Dam were equally as hilarious! By far out of the trip (gambling, drinking, club hopping), the tour was the BEST! I would do this tour every visit to sin city!* Note, the previous reviews are probably regarding a different tour bus operator that is no longer doing the Hoover Dam Tours....or they just went on a bad day :/
5	Great trip with a tour guide rich in history and a good sense of humor! It was great to get a good history lesson before you get there so you are a lot more "awe" out of the Dam when you get there! The ride back was a great lesson on Vegas history! I would do it again if I go back to Vegas..which I intend to!
3	I'd say this tour was worth it. Two people got to see the Hoover Dam for $58 with a groupon. Not bad. But I really would have appreciated the following:1) A heads up that the tour guide would not stop talking for the entire drive. He repeated himself a lot. From reading other reviews it sounds like some people appreciated his incessant anecdotes and opinions, but I was disappointed that I didn't bring any headphones or ear plugs to drown him out sometimes.2) A heads up that security on this bus is extremely tight. No luggage, even small luggage, is allowed on the bus. You also cannot bring food into the Hoover Dam site, but you can bring it on the bus. And there is food on the Hoover Dam site available for sale.
1	Wish it was better. Wasn't sure the shuttle was going to show. It arrived 15 mins late. Guide did not top talking the entire trip. Spent to much time in lines.
4	I would like to start by saying that I researched this tour and its reviews before booking so I knew what to expect. Now I know that there are a good number of bad reviews and alot of them are about Steve who supposedly babbles on and on and constantly coughs into the microphone for the entire 50 minute ride to the dam. Well I can now confirm for you that this is true.I found a deal on Groupon where the tickets were half price. with that being said I paid $29 each ticket. At first I was unsure weather to make the purchase, but despite the negative reviews I read about this tour company I figured I would be on vacation so why not. Best case it would be an great tour and worst case it would be a memorable experience. I think that because I went with an open mind this set the stage for my experience. CUSTOMER SERVICE:Before arriving in Vegas I called the tour company, gave them my groupon purchase confirmation and reserved the date. The phone operator instructed me to go to the west wing at the MGM grand (where we were staying) where they would pick us up for our tour. The phone operator was helpful, friendly, and accommodating and helped to plan our tour.TOUR DAY! Fast forward to the morning of the tour. We made our way to the west wing at the MGM as instructed and were somewhat confused to if we going the right way as the MGM is a very large hotel. (asking for directions from hotel staff is advised). We made our way to the west wing tour lobby. We walked out the door (still confused if we were in the right area) and a guy asks if we were going to a tour. I respond yes (expecting the guy to be some kind of promoter trying to sell me something like everyone else in Vegas) but to my surprise he pulled out his list and greeted me by name and then pointed over and said "That's the dam bus, we will be leaving shortly". Our pickup driver was great! very personable and had a great sense of humor. Overall It was a good start and certainly set the stage of what to expect.REGISTRATION:After being picked up from our hotel, we stopped at a couple other hotels before being dropped off at registration at the miracle mile shops where we signed in, picked up our name badge, and were assigned a bus. THE TOUR:We were assigned to "Bus1" and immediately upon climbing into the coach I saw the driver's name tag on the driver's shirt that read "Steve". Based on the reviews I have read online, my initial reaction was "Oh god, Here we go" So we climbed on to the bus. The driver, Steve, closed the door, stood up in the isle way and over the microphone started to instruct everyone on what not to do and how we should keep our voices down while he was talking over the microphone. He then began to start talking about the bus and how old and elaborated about how bad it was (the bus was average, it had AC and was clean). So with that interesting start, we began our 50 minute trip from the las vegas strip to Hoover dam. Steve talked continuously and he did not pause between his sentences for the entire 50 Minute ride there. Steve loved to ramble about random topics and would then ask rhetorical questions such as "Well Steve, how did that happen" to which he would answer himself with an even longer explanation. The best part is that Steve spent our entire 50 Minute ride to the dam hacking and coughing mid sentence. He literally never stops talking and maybe that is why he is always clearing his throat as other reviews suggest. Either way it was hilarious. Once we got to the dam, we offloaded and were given 2.5 hours to do the tour and wander the dam, I was interested in taking the power plant tour however the lines inside the dam tour were ridiculous (Run by a different company, please read my hoover dam review for more information) after waiting in line for over an hour we decided to cut our losses where we went back outside, walked the dam, did the tourist thing and grabbed lunch at the dam cafe before heading back to the bus. we took another bus ride this time for about 40 minutes where we stopped at a chocolate and going to our hotel. Steve our driver, while he talked non-stop, was loaded with information about vegas history. You can ask him questions and he will tell you a story, and he has a wicked sense of humor that kept me laughing almost the entire ride.  CLOSING:Simply put, if you have a planned agenda, high expectations, like to be in control, are hung over, or are an overall boring person, then I'd suggest you not be on bus1.If you are adventurous, whimsical, and have fun with whatever comes along then I highly recommend you take Steve's tour bus as it is hilarious.As for myself, I know that I will have to take this tour again the next time I am in vegas.
4	I have taken this tour two different times. Some parts of it seem a little dated, mostly the dialogue in the beginning video, but the facts are still very interesting and the tour is amazing because of the structures. I would recommend this tour to anyone that is not claustrophobic because at one point in the tour, you take an elevator to the lower levels and it can be a bit much for people with those sensitivities.
4	I just want mimic Josh O's review. As funny as it sounds that guy is spot on. I too got on the bus and saw the guy's name was Steve and a leaned over and told my girlfriend "this is the guy!" And sure enough Steve started babbling your ears off. What took me by surprise is that Steve is both the tour guide AND the bus driver. So it seemed kinda unsafe to navigate a 50ft bus in Vegas while holding a mic in one hand and talking like an auctioneer. If your native language is not English there is no way you can understand this guy. But off we went on the 50min ride, Steve hacking and all. (But to the guys' credit, he has a lot off neat info if you pay attention)We went on a Monday so 2.5hrs was enough time to take the power plant tour and see everything at the Dam. But I wouldn't say enough time to lolly-gag around. I would suggest bringing some sandwiches. You can't take them off the bus, but you can eat them when you board to leave. The snack bar at the dam is a long line and over priced. On the ride back you stop at a chocolate factory where you can buy a single chocolate for about $5. So this was about a 30 min waste. The choc factory "tour" took all of 45 seconds to see. Then Steve takes you back to your hotels. Along the way home he actually gives some useful tips on where to eat and what to do in Vegas, so that was nice for me since this was my first time to Vegas. For us he started at the south end of the strip and zig-zagged his way back to the north end. I guess from here it depends who is on the bus and where you stay. We stayed at the Circus Circus (c'mon I had a free room offer) and it took forever to get back. We left the dam at 1:15 and got at the hotel at 4:00. (This includes the choc de-"tour"). If you have $15 to spare I would hop off at Mandalay Bay and take a cab north and save yourself and herky-jerky hour in a charter bus. Overall I still say 3.5-4 stars. It wasn't bad or terrible. I'd say it's worth the money to see the Hoover Dam. If you have a warped sense of humor and a little patience, you won't be disappointed. If you are kinda uptight and have no patience, I can see this tour being quite frustrating for you.
1	You can do it on your own it is easy to doyou do not have to do it with yourIt is great place to visit but do it on your own
1	We lived in LVH, a hotel in Paradise. They just ignore people who do not live on the strip. We were supposed to leave at 10am and return by 3pm. The shuttle didn't show up on time and we waited more than half an hour. After several calls, the shuttle finally shown up and drove us to the bus. And when we returned, the bus driver spent 1.5 hrs on the strip and dropped us off after all the other clients. I'll never try their service in the future.
1	Most stressful experience of my Vegas trip!!!Had reservations to be picked up at 9am.  After waiting outside the hotel for 15 mins we called the company asking where our ride was.  They said they already picked up at our hotel and we weren't there.  I'm a workforce planner who grew up military, "if you're on time your 5 mins late, if you're 5 mins early you're on time".  You can probably imagine my disbelief when they said we were late and it was our fault we missed the shuttle.  We then had to pay to take a taxi to planet hollywood (which we were not reimbursed for), and then mis directed multiple times until we finally found the tour meet up location on our own.  The highlight of the morning was the lady who answered my call at the Hoover Dam Company who kept asking me questions about where I was and then would talk over me every time I tried to answer.  The tour itself was satisfactory, but this poorly run operation had a horrible start which elevated my stress level to an unreasonable level so early in the day.My overall recommendation, find a different company to go through or rent a car and drive out on your own.
2	I saw my life flash before my eyes at least twice on this Dam Tour.  Let's start at the beginning: they were late picking me up. They said they would arrive at 9, but they didn't show until close to 9:30. The bus driver was really nice, but something was either wrong with him or the bus, because the bus stalled many, many times. Including on a steep hill near the dam. And the bus started rolling backwards. I not only found the dam that day, but I also found religion. The tour guide was nice, but not spectacular. I appreciated his "dam" humor, and he seemed pretty knowledgeable. We had a couple on our bus who had paid for a rafting part of the tour, and neither the guide nor the driver had any idea where they were supposed to drop them off. The whole thing was kind of a hot mess, and I was pretty happy that I only paid half price thanks to Groupon.
1	This was a horrible experience! We purchased tickets for the 9:30 AM shuttle, we arrived at the tour lobby by 9:10, the  bus, however didn't get there till about 9:40, no big deal. We then headed over to the mall where we would be transferred onto a more comfortable and larger bus. We made a line, they processed us and gave us an ID sticker and we proceeded to make the line to enter the new bus. We were probably 9th or 10th in line, we picked our seats, felt comfortable and settled in. After the bus is about 90% full, our name is called and we get pulled off. For what reason? A different party brought an unexpected guest, therefore OUR accommodations were hindered to make way for other individuals who did not plan accordingly. After we de-bus, we're taken to a van that has already been cramped with people. Upon inspection, my partner and I notice that we would not even be able to sit together, rather we would be expected to sit next to random strangers for a pretty lengthy ride. Furthermore, the seats were fit for a first grader, not a grown man. When we took this to the manager, he stated "oh! you want to sit together??" Um... YES. We didn't realize that was such a shocking request. Ultimately, he was unwilling to accommodate us, so that was a day completely wasted. Sadly, they didn't even offer us a lift back after all the hassle they put us through. So be warned, you probably don't want to waste your money on this tour unless you want to be treated like a third-rate human being.
1	Worst customer experience!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!We were told to meet in front of the El Cortez casino at 8:45. We were there at 8:30 when 9 rolled around and not one bus had drove by I called the company. The lady told me we missed the bus and we would have to take a cab to planet hollywood to make the tour. To make this short save your money this is a complete scam. Thankfully Groupon showed how a company should treat a customer and refunded the money.
1	HORRIBLE!!No, just don't bother. You should just drive yourself and get the better tour at the Hoover Dam on your own. The bus broke down, the company doesn't care about you after they have their money and it was an expensive terrible bad experience. for my parents, brother and I.If you have at least 2 people going it is cheaper, and I guarantee a better experience to rent a car and drive there yourself. The drive itself is beautiful but on the bus you don't get to decide when and where you can take pics. Also you don't drive over the high suspension bridge or get to walk that to get the amazing upper aerial view. With the Hoover Dam Tour Company you get the small tour, but most people will tell you to do the larger dam tour at the Dam. YOu are not able to upgrade at the Dam. This was a waste of money and I had even gotten a Groupon for it so it was about 1/2 price. Still way too much money. When I emailed the company for a refund or some sort of damages they pointed out that they make everyone sign a contract negating them from liability of their buses breaking down. For the extra hours of sitting out in the heat and having to spend more money there on lunch because we were delayed so long this was a very terrible waste of money. The Dam itself is amazing though and worth the trip to, just use any other company or drive there yourself.
