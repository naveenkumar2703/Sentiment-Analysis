4	A welcome addition to the area. Overall, this store seemed small but has the essentials. I expected more produce and freshly made food like Fresh and Easy. This store is way better though than visiting the big Walmart near Gilbert Rd.
4	This Walmart is new so obviously is in clean and looks immaculate in comparison to neighboring Walmarts. For people who like to night shop it is a welcome change coming here and not having to deal with stockers in your way in every aisle. This Walmart basically sells everything the big Walmarts sell except electronics, home goods and clothes. The staff seemed friendly enough for working at midnight. I will come here over the big Walmarts for now on for food.
5	Visited this Wal-Mart for the 1st time today. In and out without having to deal with all of the craziness. I dealt with Chelsea from the deli today and she was so pleasant and very helpful! I never get that kind of customer service from Wal-Mart, ever! Thank you for your help today, Chelsea!
