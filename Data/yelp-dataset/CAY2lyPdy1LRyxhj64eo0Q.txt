3	Cable is ok, but on an older tv. Wireless is hopelessly slow. But, rooms are adequate, and the owners are nice. Plus the ac works well. Overall, a decent room for a reasonable price.
1	Owner would not provide confirmation numbers so we cancelled room after 10 phone calls - 4 months in advance of the intended stay date. He called my wife a liar on the phone. I bet anybody who stays here for any reason would enjoy it a lot....
4	Great place!
