4	This place is just around the corner from work-- it has been recently redecorated. It looks very nice now. Prices are pretty good, but I come here because Linda does an outstanding job on my pedicure!  You can find me here every two weeks!
1	One of the issues I have overlooked was the way a walk in is greeted. 99%of the time is Can you come back in an hour?If getting a pedicure they will always pacify you to have your feet soaking.Have you ever had an issue with your nails and then returned to have them fix it??? Yikes! The owner who is the male that greets you asks you what is wrong ,while working on a patron.There is dead silence and everyone turns around and stares at you.  He then belittles you in front of everyone. In the end he will even charge you to fix the mistake..Where is the customer service? I was so embarrassed!
3	When I walk in, everyone turns around & stares at you.  It also seems they try to up charge you on pedicures every time~ they charge you extra to exfoliate & remove roughness from the bottom of your feet!  Isn't that part if a pedicure? They also try to up charge you in telling you that you need to have your acrylic removed from your nails with new acrylic  Every 3 months! That is $50.00 for new acrylic, fill & gel polish.  Who can afford that every 90 days.
5	They do a wonderful job and are very friendly.  My husband and I stop in for a pedicure whenever we are in town and we have always been pleased with the services.
