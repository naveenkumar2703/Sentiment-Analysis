3	I came here few years ago after the wait at Rain was incredibly long-we decided to drive accross the street. I just had a ok time here...the music was alright but the crowd was lil bit older.   I didnt really mind it much though for $10 cover.
3	4 to 5 stars based all upon the view.  The top of the Rio bar has the best view of Vegas, and on a warm May evening, was a perfect place to go dancing on the bachelorette party outing.  It was just gorgeous and we all had a blast.  Drinks were more expensive and not as strong as I would like.  Music was top 40 dance.  Lots of levels and room to move around.  One Level had a pole in the middle.  Yes, we made the bride to be dance on it!  What else are your friends for except to torture you!
4	I'm not a club goer but this place was so cool...51 stories up, partying on the roof with multiple level dance floors and different music on each!  And some ofmthe Go Go dancers can really go and are fun to watch.  Only downside is that all the seating is reserved so come here to get the night started right then find another place to chill some.
