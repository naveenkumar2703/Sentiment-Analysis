4	I had a long wait to see Dr. Lomax, but he and the other staff were exceptional. They were all friendly and apologetic for the wait. Dr. Lomax spent more time talking with me than most doctors do, and was happy to answer any questions I had.
4	Went to see Dr. Lomax for a ear problem.  Although the wait was a little bit long and I was finally seen after about 30 minutes after my original appt time, the staff was very professional and let me know of the delay before hand.  Dr. Lomax was also very friendly and easy to talk to, took time to answer the many questions i had that day even though the office was a bit busy.  Nice and clean office with a kids play area, that's a big plus too.  I would highly recommend Dr. Lomax!
4	I came to Advanced EN&T for a hearing test. The staff was welcoming, friendly, and thorough. The doctor did an initial exam of my ears after asking me about my concerns, then I met with a technician who performed a hearing test. She discussed the outcome with me and then I also spoke with the doctor about the outcome of my test. The overall time of my visit was 1 hour and 36 minutes- the place got busy. There is a play area for small children, a tv and plenty of up-to-date magazines to read to help you pass the time. I left feeling like my concerns were addressed and handled in a professional way.
