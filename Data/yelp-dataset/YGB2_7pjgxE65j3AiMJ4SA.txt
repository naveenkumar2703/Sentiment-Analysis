4	I came here with some co-workers on a work trip. Didn't buy anything but it was fun to browse! One of the employees was this super cute and funny gay guy. One of my associates was dancing to one of the songs in the store and he wanted to challenge her to a dance-off! He was super fun and we ended up seeing him around after we left the store and started dancing with us! I just love people like that :)
4	A lot of selections and really good sales. Customer service is great.
3	You would think it's the forum shops and people visit here from all over the world, and they would keep every size in stock. Well, no they don't.
