3	Fairly clean. Very busy and was definitely understaffed. The girl with large gauge ear piercings was keeping it moving pretty well though. Our ice cream and corn dog was good and came out quickly.
3	This place was good. We got 4 dipped cones and the mediums are quite big! They were quick as we were in the drive through. Good place for a quick snack.
2	Hubby and I stopped in for ice cream after getting back from Wickenburg. We hadn't been here for awhile. Ordered 2 medium Blizzards and to our surprise the cost was over $8.  They were made well, making sure the candy was mixed well and not all on top or bottom. However, Sonic's is cheaper, and McDonald's is even cheaper. Sorry not gonna repeat-times are tough.
1	Used drive thru and when trying to explain my order a very rude and snobby teenage girl wouldn't let me finish speaking. You sell a service at least put on a fake smile and be pleasant to talk to . A lot of people need a job be grateful you have one
