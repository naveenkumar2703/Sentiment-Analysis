4	This was a perfect start to a night that went on to include a Feist concert just down the street.  I had Fantastic kabuli murgh chicken in brown rice with raisins and almonds.  The food was perfect for me fitting my healthy choosiness.  The other guests were big fans of the sambosa appetizer which was like a better Indian samosa.And what?- They have my favorite German beer Optimator?  Are you kidding? YES!
5	Fantastic food!I've eaten here a couple of times and never been disappointed. Very cozy tables outside in the summer. Try the Lamb Kabuli Pulao...delishhhhhhhhhh
4	They have pretty good food and the price is about state-street-average (places outside of downtown is about $1-3 cheaper).  The service is medium--a bit slow. I'm now sure of the "bread" policy for Afghanistan food.  I mean, when you go to Italian restaurants, theoretically, they'll supply you dinner bread before your entree as much as you want. Here, there's a limit and it is quite little. They charge you afterwards.The food is pretty good though.
2	Given the proximity to other very similar restaurants on this block, pick the other restaurants over this one.  Owned by the kids of Kabul (across the street), Maza is just a mediocre version of Kabul and only $1-3 cheaper.  The service was terrible (though I went only a month or two after it opened, so that may have improved), they charge for a very small amount of bread, which is a bummer when you have a larger group of people, and the food is pretty average.  If you are in the mood for this kind of food, go across the street to Kabul where the food is reliably very delicious.
2	I wasn't very impressed with Maza's food.  The pasta in the soup I had was really overcooked, and the kinda-bland, muddy-flavored entree didn't nearly compare to those at Kabul across the street.  Maybe they've gotten better since they opened, but there are too many excellent restaurants on State St. to choose from so it will be a while before I try it again.
