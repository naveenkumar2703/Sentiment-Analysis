5	Great storage place and excellent staff. Super secure, and easy to get in and out of.  I looked at a number of storage places in the area and in terms of service, staff, location, facilities and price, Maximum Security Storage wins hands down.
4	Really nice facility, the staff are really helpful and easy going. The storage units are clean and climate controlled ( which is a plus living in the desert... Gets hot here in the summer ) also reasonable prices! All in all it's a nice storage facility, with great amenities. I would recommend this place!
5	I have been using Maximum Security since 2005 and am so very happy with my choice to use them for my storage needs!  The unit is clean and climate controlled.  The customer service is great, I love that they recognize me when I come in every few months :D.  It is a fantastic value and I would recommend them to anyone who needs to store their belongings on the West Side!
