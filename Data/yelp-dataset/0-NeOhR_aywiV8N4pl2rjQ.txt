5	This is a new store and has several sales going on at any given time. They carry a great collection for little girls but for boys it is a challenge to find things that are cute but boyish and still pocket friendly. The customer service at this store is average but they try hard to be friendly. One bad thing, they do not give you a small shopping cart to push around so if you have a toddler, either you are carrying them the whole time, or you can bring in your stroller and shop or you can let the kid go wild in the store. This store is near the Chandler mall but not IN the mall. It is its own separate thing.  I bought five outfits the other day for $25! Not bad.
5	All things for baby, Great prices on all clothing and toys. Nicely divided by boys and girls down the middle of the store.
