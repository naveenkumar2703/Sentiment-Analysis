2	Vision Express is a chain opticians operating in pretty much every town center. You would imagine they are all the same but the customer service in this branch is beyond disappointing.I had my eyes tested in Vision Express in Perth and was given a prescription. Due to my poor student status, the nice lady gave me a form to fill out to receive a NHS discount. For that reason I couldn't pick my glasses that day, but the optician told me it would be fine for me to fill my prescription at any Vision Express branch.So once I received my money off coupon I toddled on down to Vision Express in the St James Centre. Well according to the rather scary woman behind the counter there was no way in hell I could fill my prescription at any other store and it had to be the store I had my eyes tested in. We argued back and forth for a good 20 minutes before she turned me away. Poor show, you don't want my money? FINE. I will take it elsewhere. Thanks for the inconvenience. Funny how apparently I could only get my glasses at the one Vision Express branch where I had my eyes tested yet Tesco's opticians were happy enough to sell me some. Next time I won't use Vision Express.
