2	Was very quiet for a Saturday night. Food ok, staff lovely.
4	Songkran, housed in a quirky property on the corner of India Place in Stockbridge, served me very good soup and more than decent trout. The service was smiling and friendly, and a lot more relaxed than many Thai places, which I appreciated.Overall, we said: "Songkran struck me as a rather good little Thai place. I was in desperate need of a good Thai meal to blank the horror of Chaophraya from my mind, and Songkran managed this task very nicely. I'd be delighted to come back and would happily recommend that you pay it a visit."
5	We came to Edinburgh on vacation expecting to eat great food as well as great VARIETIES of food, including Thai & so we did!  Song Kran's dishes delight your epicurian senses & leave you feeling amazingly satisfied as well. The owner is a lovely lady who does all the cooking & is so sweet & friendly. Her son Matthew waits the tables & he's a delight too. The atmosphere is also very pleasant & attractive. I HIGHLY recommend this wonderful Thai restaurant & wouldn't hesitate to go back. A real find!  APOLOGIES FOR POSTING AN INCORRECT PHOTO!
