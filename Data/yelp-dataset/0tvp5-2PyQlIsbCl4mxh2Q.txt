5	Carters Bar offers a range of excellent home made food and drinks at very reasonable prices. Personally, I would recommend visiting Carters Bar to sample their Soup and Toastie deals, which you can get for just 3 pounds. When I was last there I had a bowl of Vegetarian Chilli with a Toastie for this amazing price and couldn't even manage the whole lot as the portions are so generous.Situated conveniently next to Haymarket Station, it always has a pleasant atmosphere with friendly regulars and barstaff. Although the pub is quite small it has two levels and outside there is a solitary table where you can enjoy a cigarette with a drink if you so choose. There are also weekly live music nights, pub quizzes etc. Even if slightly out of the way for those who live more centrally, Carters Bar is definitely well worth the trip.
4	I visited Carters for the first time last night with one of my fellow 'tweeps'.  I have to say that was pleasantly surprised.  I did not expect such a nice wee pub on that part on Morrison st.  The bar is quite small but there is a mezzanine upstairs with plenty of seating and you can 'lurk' at the customers downstairs.  I did not check the ales selection as we opted straight away for the Japanese lager, which is very drinkable! The locals are quite friendly and there are 2 big tellies for the football fans.  Nice atmosphere overall. A good discovery.
2	I went there on a Saturday night with two friends and experienced a drunk football fan seating at our table and calling us "a**holes" all night. The bouncer spotted him but was probably too busy doing nothing and didn't lift a finger.Otherwise we had a nice chat with a few other local customers, but this "event" kinda ruined our evening there.
