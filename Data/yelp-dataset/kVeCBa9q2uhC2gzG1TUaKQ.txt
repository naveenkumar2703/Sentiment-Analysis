3	A Subway is a Subway. Some are in strip malls, some are in truckstops. Some, like this one are stuck out in Hendertucky, next to the railroad tracks and sharing a funky, hard to get in and out of parking lot with a mini-strip mall and a McDonalds with a drive through from ****. Getting to this Subway if you're heading East on Horizon Drive requires U-Turns and typically some brisk acceleration that a Formula 1 driver would appreciate. Once inside it's your typical Subway with a collection of tattooed teenagers working the counter, slightly burnt cookies, and they all have a listening problem when you tell them Extra Jalapenos for the 4th time. But otherwise...a Chicken & Bacon Ranch made at this Subway is the same as if you got it at the Subway at Flying J in Big Cabin, Nebraska along I-80 in the middle of nowhere. 3 Stars. (So why review a Subway? Some of them seriously suck. This one when I first moved to Vegas was one that was horrible. They've gotent better, except for that tendency to not give extra jalapenos.)(Yelp 100 in 2013 Challenge #7)
4	I got my sandwich. Who cares about customer service, do half of you guys that reviewed this subway complaining about customer service tipped any subway even if they gave good customer service?
