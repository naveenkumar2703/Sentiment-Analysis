3	I haven't been inside in so long. Went to the Jason Mraz concert here. The old Colisseum is still holding up after all these years.
3	Fighting Bob Fest 2011 was held here. Solid sports stadium.
4	Huge amount of space and clean facilities--great for big conventions. Parking is only $3 and pretty big parking lots on top of that! It's RIGHT off the highway which is so convenient!
3	The upside? This place is huge.The downside? This place is huge.I would say the experience is determined by how the vendors use the space and how they try to make the guests feel.  Both times I've been here (Food & Wine and Well Expo) it was hard to relax and feel casual.  Cement floors, no music, and fluorescent lighting definitely makes you feel too convention-y.  That being said, they can fit a ton of people and vendors, so that's great.  However, if someone has a band playing, maybe some table cloths with color, and some different lighting, this might be nice!Parking was $6 for me, even when my husband was only dropping me off.  :/AND cash only.  Srsly.
4	This was our third year for the annual "Istmas beer and cheese" - I really like the festival but this year there were too many people.  I didn't get to sample much beer and I think I only sampled 2 cheese.  The lines getting in were terribly organized and the coat check was ridiculous.  They really should have that figured out by now.  The event itself is great and we will probably go again - I was just disaapointed that I didn't get around as much this year because of the crowds.
4	I've only been inside here for the roller derby. The place was great for that, but I could see disliking it for some of the other events they host. The place is big, the parking is over priced, and the rest is what I imagine you'd except. I'll be back for the lovely and fantastic roller derby girls~
