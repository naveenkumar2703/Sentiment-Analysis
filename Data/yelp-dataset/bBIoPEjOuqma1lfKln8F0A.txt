4	I recently moved and just started going to this location.  As I am a creature of habit, I resisted going and kept going out of my way to my old hair stylist that had been cutting my hair of the last 5 years. So, I finally broke down and decided to give this place a try. I a pleased to say that the stylists here are very friendly and most importantly, can cut hair very well. I have gotten my hair cut here a few times now, and have yet to be disappointed.
1	please avoid this place. Rude and unfriendly hair dressers. They need to learn and take classes on how to welcome customers. As long as the two ladies who were there the day I took a visit still employed there I will not go back. May 7 2012
4	First time ever getting my haircut at great clips. Good experience overall. Was greeted & seated promptly. Michelle cut my hair & did a very good job. My last haircut was at a salon & I paid $35. The $12 cut from Michelle was better than the $35 cut. I will definitely be going back every 4 weeks. Great cut especially for the price.
5	I was in bad need of a haircut and beard trimming and my experience at great clips was nothing short of amazing. Latasha was fantastic and trimmed me up right. Will def go back again!
