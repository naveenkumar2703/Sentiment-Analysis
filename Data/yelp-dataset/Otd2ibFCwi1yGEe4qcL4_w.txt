5	My entire family has been going to Dr. Burke for about 20 years. He used to have an office in the Superstition Springs area but we all followed him here when he moved. If you need a veteranarian, this is the place! The office is clean, pleasant, welcoming, and all the staff are always wonderful. Dr. Burke and the other vets in the office are all amazing with the animals. I have brought dogs and cats to him over the years but I also see people in the office with birds and reptiles. His prices are fair and there are usually appointments the same day if you are willing to take any of the providers. I wouldn't take my animals anywhere else and Dr. Burke can never retire!!!
5	I have been taking my two dogs to Dr. Burke for 4 years now and he is the best vet I have found in the valley. My beagle is older and has a lot of issues, but Dr. Burke always suggests an alternative to the expensive therapies. I never feel pressured to buy more treatments than are necessary. Also, he is always patient with me after check ups and answers all of my questions thoroughly. He made my baby healthy again so he gets 5 stars.
5	they were able to squeeze me in, have affordable prices and they don't try to up-sell you or make you feel like a horrible owner for not wanting to do every single stupid thing vets try to sell these days. in fact, they actually agreed with me on not doing certain things that other vets try to make me do. anyway, enough of my rant. trustworthy, friendly and affordable.
5	Dr. Burke was the best caring for my cockatiel. His love of birds is obvious, and when I'm ready for a new feathered friend I will use Cornerstone.
5	Absolutely the best Vet in Arizona. The staff actually loves the patients and goes out of their way to make both your pet and yourself feel comfortable.  We have 4 dogs that we trust to Dr. BURKE and the staff. I highly recommend them where ever in the valley you may live....well worth any drive.
