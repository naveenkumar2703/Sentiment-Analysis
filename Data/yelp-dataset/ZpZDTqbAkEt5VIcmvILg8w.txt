4	I like the idea of having the same hairstylist each and every time. Unfortunately with some places, the stylist come and go so quickly they don't get to learn what you like and all.The Augusta Ranch Hair Studio is different, they cater to people and the staff has been then for a long time. Angie does my color and cuts! Which I love! She is friendly and very knowledgeable about products. Isn't pushy on selling you items you don't need either.Pam (owner) has done a straightening technique on my hair and also my daughters. She does a great job and it is SO much cheaper than a Brazilian. I do wish the prices were lower. I think a hair cut alone is $23.00 but knowing that you have the same stylist each visit does out weight the price.
1	I called ahead and made a 3:30 appointment for a haircut so I wouldn't have to wait. I arrived on time and told the receptionist that I had an appointment with Kelli. Rather than tell Kelli I was there waiting, this arrogant woman ignored me and continued to talk on the phone for maybe 10 minutes before I got angry and left. No way would I go back to this business. They are obviously unable to hire front-desk employees with a minimum level of competence.
