5	My flatmate plays for the Edinburgh University rugby team and this is the place he picks up all of his accessories. I have been there a couple of times with him and they really do seem to have everything you could want if you play rugby, or if you are an avid supporter of rugby.They have a huge selection of rugby boots that high street shops simply wouldn't be able to compete with. They also do a good selection of rugby shirts, both international and domestic, and even offer you with the chance to get a name and number printed on the back of it. Every rugby accessory imaginable is also on offer here- rugby balls, tees, gum shields, headgear, shoulder padding etc. The staff look really knowledgeable and was even able to identify what position my flatmate played just by looking at him.
4	A great store for rugger tragics and Antipodean lost souls like me...if only they poured a pint as well I'd never leave!
