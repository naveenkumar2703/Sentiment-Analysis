5	After having a hip that was 'locked' finding Doc Dearth was a miracle.  He was gentle but effective and with three visits I feel amazing.  I was always one to run to Urgent Care and treat symptoms but having this experience has now made me realize there are other ways (and safer ways) to care for our bodies.  I'm very grateful for the Doc.
5	I found Dr. Dearth by way of referral from a different chiropractor. Dr. Dearth is the doctor that other chiropractors go to.  I saw him for several years and then moved away. In trying to find another dr like him is how I figured out what a gem Dr. Dearth is.  Our family decided to move back to Mesa because the quality of our doctors in AZ was superior to what we could find where we were living.  I have been in pain due to a back and hip issue for 7 months.  One adjustment from Dr. Dearth and I can move again. I'm seeing him weekly to maintain mobility.  My insurance does not cover him but I gladly pay cash.  It's worth the $45.00 a visit.  Dr. Dearth is funny and quirky and exceptionally talented.  I highly recommend him as a chiropractor.
