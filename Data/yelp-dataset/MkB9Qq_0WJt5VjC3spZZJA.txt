4	I like going to this gym as opposed to the other LA Fitness's, because it's clean and everything is in working order.  The staff are friendly and the personal trainers are approachable.  I just wish the upstairs was bigger, so it could have more treadmills/ellipticals.
5	Clean location. Very nice. Loves.
4	I'm a fan of this location. For the most part, the staff greet you when you walk in (the signal butte gym they didn't even look at you), it's pretty clean (I think), and it's close to home. They have a good variety of classes that give you a pretty good workout. My only complaint is that the director of the classes is ALWAYS 15 min late to teach class which is super annoying. But, even though she is never on time, she will kick your butt. I take my son to the dayacare here, and the ladies that work there are all really nice. They remember my son's name and always gives him a sticker when we leave. They seem very attentive. The body works instructor (I think her name is Jolene) is awesome!
5	This has a better pool than any of the other gyms, even my favorite on Bell Rd. This is my second favorite LA fitness gym in the valley. The gym itself is fantastic and interior design is one of the better ones. To take classes, especially cycle, make sure you arrive early. The room where classes are being held is small, but this still deserves five stars because the pool is the best. In a great location and usually not occupied.
4	I really love going to this LA Fitness on Greenfield. Of the few LA Fitness gyms that I've been in the area it seems to be the most open, bright, and clean. It's great to have the gym divided into the different areas. Treadmills, elliptical, bikes, and stair climbers upstairs, circuit training in the "big" area, free weights towards the back. Just trying to give you a little visual.I feel comfortable at the gym. I'm not some massive weightlifter by any means (although my picture may deceive you... haha) but I feel like there's a really good mix of people there to make anyone feel comfortable.I've just had some issues with the administrative side of the gym. My roommate was getting charged for a while since it didn't switch over to my card when I signed up with him and I've just never felt like the staff was friendly toward me... I know it's not always their job to say "Hi" when I walk into the gym or as I'm leaving but when they have conversations with a lot of other people, or I almost always have to scan my card by myself just isn't the greatest. (These are really nit picky things by the way - just a few of my experiences.)
1	I used to love going to the gym here. good working machines, and great classes... ALTHOUGH when they bought out PUREFITNESS, my husband had canceled his membership at that time... he sent in the forms like told to do.. and it STILL CONTINUED coming out of our account for 5 months!! each month it came out i would talk to a front desk person/trainer and they said it would be taken care of.. so again it happend the next month and so on.. which i continued to talk to them each month, until i finally called corporate, which the RUDE corporate lady explained to me that the paperwork must have gotten LOST when they took over PUREFITNESS, which is not her (their) fault... WELL EXCUSE ME!! but it surley not MY FAULT you lost the paperwork in transistion, as a huge corporation you would think they would credit me back the $120 that was continuously taken out. considering i spend $300 or MORE a month in the gym, including my membership,kids care, and personal training 2x a week. i would NEVER reccomend this gym to anyone... for the LACK of customer service, lack of knowledge, and lack of responsibility!!!! when i have been a member for over 2 years spending $300 a month and they cant credit me $120 one time for THEIR mistake??? ridiculous!!! HERE I COME LIFETIME FITNESS!!!!!!!!!! :)
3	My first venture to LA fitness outside my Chicago gym: same open, bright space and positive atmosphere, more diverse range of people (nice to see people with disabilities, including the man with seeping elephantiasis).  Strange arrangement of the ellipticals on a floating elevated strip with not that great a view.   Staff a little impersonal or icy, one I flagged down their attention to ask about towels, they directed me to the juice stand lady that was selling them.   Guess I should have brought my own......
4	Of All the L.A. fitnesses I've been to, I like this one the best. Very open, modern and well maintained. Ever since they have closed 2 other gyms in mesa, the gym has been a bit crowded but other than that, great!
2	Overall clean and modern facility, with the following issues: They do not open until 8am on saturday and sunday (which makes a difference in the summer when it's very hot by this time or you're training for an event). They don't have a regular abdominal crunch machines. (they only have matrix ab crunch machines that can usually only be used by guys since they require more weight to be lifted.) The stair climbers have a time limit of 30 minutes, and are usually taken up.
5	I go to two locations regularly and this location always has the friendliest people working, looks clean, and has a great variety of classes. It doesn't seem as closed in or dark as some of the other locations. No complaints :) The women at the front desk on the evenings I go always seems to be wiping down the doors, windows, desk etc. Which when you consider all the sweating on the machines it is nice to at least have the illusion that everything is being cleaned all the time!
4	This LA Fitness is just like all other locations. Cardio kickboxing class with Andrea is awesome!!!I don't like how packed it gets during the 5-7 hour. And they hold the body fat percentage calculator hostage and make you sign up for training for it.
3	When I started coming to this location a couple years back I was so excited, it was never super packed like the Scottsdale location and it was really clean with fairly new equipment, I always felt comfortable there. It's slowly but surely going downhill. They haven't updated ANYTHING in this place in forever. The cardio machines are often broken. I'm a spinner and this location is still using bikes from like 6 years ago. It's impossible to find one that's in full working order. It's like musical bikes for the first 15 min of class.  I will say I love the instructors for their  group fitness classes here. Most all of them are awesome.  If they would just update some of the equipment this place would be 5 stars in my book again.
3	Nice facility, pretty clean for a gym. It is super packed and hard to get on the machine you want. The hours are not very convenient.
2	phone call: hey, do you guys have a STEAM room? "please hold, let me check...yep we have one!" FAIL, no they dont. but they do have a Sauna...yet, Arizona weather is a Sauna...never understood why fitness clubs put Sauna's in when its free outside.hours are not the most convenient, but arent so bad. I never get the gallery of "managers and reps" sitting over in the office areas, what a cost maximizer for the corporation. geez, I wonder what my monthly fee would be if they had 1 mgr/sales rep per shift, which really is all thats needed. kids club is nice, but what they want to charge you is not worth it.Those that give this place 5 stars have most likely never been to a gym before ever and have no clue what to expect. bottom line, they can do better, they just choose not to.
4	Just wanted everyone to know...the THURSDAY NIGHT ***ZUMBA** class at 5:45pm is AWESOME!I sure hope they DON't close this location, because it's conveniently located, just off the 60 frwy. & Greenfield (Across from Walmart)     (Even though the equipment & club is OLD! bummer :(I'm a HUGE fan of ZUMBA! It's a** FUN workout** & very motivating On Thursday night, the instructor, BEATRIZ really rocks the house!She's a GREAT instructor because she takes time to show you the moves in the beginning, slows down if the class is NOT "getting it" & her ENERGY is INCREDIBLE!so, if you're tired of the same old DULL routine,check out a class..I DON't think you have to be a member, you can pay $15 just to take a class..it's well worth it for the FREE 'Endorphin' boost & FAT burning factor!See you there!!! :)
1	I left LA Fitness today for good, the staff mainly Mr Gordon, is very rude and the cleaning lady is a stocker, she loves gossip and she tries to be friends with the members instead of cleaning, she has very low manners and doesn't do her job well.I was accused for something I didn't do like breaking the knob in the sauna. They claimed I broke it when the cleaning lady did and they have scared people away. Several friends of mine left to go back to Mountainside Fitness where they really know how to treat members well.Don't go to LA Fitness Las Sendas.
1	Hayden Hidalgo...stop leaving your crap flyers in unwanted sections of stores. Your gym sucks and you make it almost impossible for someone to cancel their membership.
2	I was a member here for 2 years. I canceled my membership about a year ago.  It was overpriced and I would be mid run and a "personal trainer" would approach me to talk about his sales pitch.  I really dislike stopping my run to tell them I am not interested.  It got to the point that when they asked me how my fitness goals are gonig I would tell them I have lost 100 lbs so far!  That shut them up real quick.  Since I canceled my membership I have recieved weekly "we want you back!" emails that offer me a special deal of a monthly price that is MORE than what I was paying when I canceled my membership.  I have called their local AND corporate offices to get myself removed from this mailing list, to no avail.  Overall the facilities were nice.  I was just highly disappointed in the service.
1	I've been a member for over 3 years but this place has really, really gone downhill. The trash and mess isn't cleaned up until approximately 7 a.m., unfortunately, they're open 3 hours before that and the place is a pit. I just couldn't stand it anymore.
4	I've been an LA Fitness customer since 2004, I like their gyms.  I don't say this to brag, but I've lifted the 125lb dumbbells for bench press.  The way they have the benches set up in front of the heavy dumbbells completely defies common sense.  They have a chair, not a bench, a chair in front of the heaviest weights.  What do you use a chair for when it comes to db?  db Curls, seated db tricep extension, db military press, db seated shoulder press, maybe some bent over db rows... most of those are not going to require anywhere near the heaviest weight in the gym, and you can do bent over db rows on a flat bench.  Come on LA Fitness! Get your head in the game!
1	Typical gym. Overpriced and under cleaned. There are a few reasons I give it one star.They get pissed if you work out with anyone because there is no "personal training" (I guess talking to my brother every once in a while at the gym is personal training)........unless of course you buy it from them. The sauna only worked about half the time.The music was freaking horrible and so damn loud. "Regulars" (I don't know what else to call them I went enough to be called a regular I guess) would hang by the front desk and try to flirt with the late night receptionist. It was super annoying when I was trying to check in and by the look on her face most nights I'm sure it was even more annoying to her.Now the policiesI paid cash in advance for a year so I wouldn't have to give them cc info but even that was a joke. I asked about a partial refund because some things in my life had changed (mostly having a daughter) and I wasn't going to the gym that much anymore. It wasn't a huge deal just something I was wondering about. I was told there are only 2 ways to get a partial refund.1. Proof of death (I swear I'm not lying)2. Proof you have moved to a place that doesn't have a LA fitness within 100 miles. Yea ok....well whatever. It's a gym so they are always going to try and get every dime they can. But my problem was mostly with the gym and the employees.
3	The gym is perfectly located right off the 60 and 5 minutes away from my home. The gym is always clean and is never fully packed. Now the washrooms are horribly disgusting I hate how they have the sauna next to the restrooms. I can only imagine the fungus growing in there.  Now the machines usually work fine for me except the occasional few that are broken, maybe one day they'll update the machines.  Now if you want a Personal Trainer  DO NOT GET ONE FROM HERE. Way overpriced I'm so mad at myself for signing that damn contract. Gold's Gym and Lifetime fitness have much better trainers and they give you plan on what to do when you are not with a PT. As soon as the contract ends I'm canceling and going back to gold's.
4	Pretty solid crew, solid gym!Only thing is I understand they like to keep the gym clean, but it seems like every machine I'm  on is constantly getting cleaned Hard to get a solid workout in with someone in your shoulder the whole time.Other than that, awesome.
5	This is my favorite LA fitness, It's very clean and the staff are so nice here, their yoga classes instructors are the best and the personal trainers are always so helpful when I ask them questions. Very motivating atmosphere :)
