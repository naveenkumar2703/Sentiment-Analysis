5	I have been visiting Allen Equipment for years. Allen Equipment is where I buy all my carpet cleaning chemicals, and have my equipment repaired as needed. Consistent quality service, very friendly and conservative pricing keep me coming back. I recommend to all my friends, family, and clients to think of Allen Equipment as their one stop shop for carpet & tile cleaning needs.
