5	The grand opening of Riverview Park was excellent. More to come as hotels and shops are planned. Super open, clean, and better than before. The stadium is huge!
5	This is a really nice park.  Couple jungle gyms that are really neat.  One is really tall with ropes all around it. The other is like a wave with ropes to climb on.  There is a splash pad with lots of spraying water. Very nice.  Hope it stays that way.
5	Very nice looking park so far with the Cubs Spring Training stadium nearby.  Can't wait for more shops and hotels to come in the near future.
5	This is an awesome park! It is the best park I think I have ever been to. The play structures are great and new. It has a small kids area, and a big kids area. The big kids area has a zipline, and a tunnel spinner as well as an awesome climbing structure. The park also has a nice size splash pad to cool off. The most interesting part of this park is the 50 foot high rope climbing structure! I was afraid to climb all the way up! The park is clean and has nice walking paths, a small lake and lots of grass to run in. The only negative I noticed was that the small children's playground had no shade and the slides were too hot to play on. Also because it is such a great park it was a bit crowded (though I did go on a Sunday afternoon). Overall excellent park and I will return :)
