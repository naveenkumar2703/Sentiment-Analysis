5	I was pulling a U-Haul trailer from Michigan when my van started to lose power on I-90 in Madison.  I saw that I was leaking transmission fluid and began to look for a nearby transmission service garage.  When I got to Eastside Transmission the first thing I noticed is they keep a very clean shop.  There were only two techs on duty and were busy.  Dan quickly looked at the two vehicles ahead of me then came over to look at my car within minutes.  He took time look it over well and determined that the transmission was getting hot and discharging fluid out the overflow line.  He said I needed to let it cool and take it out of over-drive and I should be fine.  I was on my way in 20 minutes and didn't even charge me for the diagnosis.  We made it home without further problems.  It's nice to find a good honest shop when you're away from home and need immediate service!

1	My car was no completed on time.  Even after I picked it up 5 days late I had to take it back twice.  East side never fixed the problem but they were glad to keep my money.Ended up getting a used transmission from Schmidt's so I could drive my car.Make sure to get paperwork if you have the misfortune of dropping your car of there.  Make sure the paperwork reflects what they told you they were going to do.

I called East Side, and they were very up front saying that they would be able to drive it around, check my fluid levels, and let me know what they thought.Everywhere else I had contacted was booked, and these guys came through!Very Helpful!
