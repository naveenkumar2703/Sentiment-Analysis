1	One of the worst nail places that I've been too. I went in to get a simple gel take off since I was too lazy to do it myself. They soaked fingers in some pink solution... It literally dyed my nails, cuticles and finger tips PINK!! It wouldn't wash off for days! She broke two of my natural grown nails in the process. I was especially pissed at that because it too me forever to grow them! The lady also rushed my take off... But for what? I'm the only one in there! Will never be coming back. Service and customer service was HORRIBLE.
