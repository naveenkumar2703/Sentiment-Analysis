5	One word "A-mazing!" The staff at little tykes is phenomenal! Dr. Carmichael and his staff will go out of their way to make sure you concerns are addressed. They are very accommodating and professional. My 4 year old loves going.  Thank you all!
5	Dr. Carmichael is an amazing pediatric dentist!
2	Really loved the Dr. but the hygenist we saw (both times with my older daughter-age 6) highly encouraged me to "wait in the waiting room" while she took her away for procedures because "kids do better when parents aren't around". I wouldn't allow it- but think some parents may not know that they can and should ask to be present during medical exams/procedures involving their children. The hygenist's here need a little training on "family centered care" and need to put their own conveniences to the side and not act as if parents are in the way. Cute, kid friendly environment- but the staff needs to match the decor.
