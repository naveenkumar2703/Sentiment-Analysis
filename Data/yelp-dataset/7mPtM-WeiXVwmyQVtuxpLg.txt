3	I like the owner, we race each other regularly. Always has what I need in a pinch, and is the  closest to hendertucky.
4	My husband will sometimes have me stop into Champion Motorsports to pick up parts he needs to fix one of our dirtbikes. I work nearby, so it's more convenient for me to do so then for him to do so. I never mind doing so because the staff is always so friendly and helpful. The prices are very fair and Eric, the owner, is very knowledgeable.
4	Good service, VERY knowledgeable, friendly to talk to, no attitude either. Champion is also a Vespa dealer, and if you have Piaggio / Vespa scooter questions you will get straight answers here. The fact that they have the patience to deal with the Italians on your behalf automatically gains them 3 Stars, and I'll tack on Star #4 for the great attitude I encountered.
