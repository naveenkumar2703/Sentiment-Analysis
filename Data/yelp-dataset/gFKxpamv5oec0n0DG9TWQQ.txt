5	Its a living Etsy and really worth checking out.  On Dec 1st they are having a Hogwarts party so get your handmade Harry Potter on.  There are many great things from penny bracelets, mustached creations, toys, hand painted furniture, and your random mixed of hand made amazing.  The staff is absolutely lovely and the local artists they support are worth every penny.  I plan on spending lots of time hanging out here.  Plus the garden at Art Square is so calming.
