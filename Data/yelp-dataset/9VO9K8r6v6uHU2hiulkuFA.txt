4	I'm really a big fan of this place. Located in the Las Vegas Outlet Center, this is a bright spot in an average location. I'd make the trip out here just to go to Van Heusen, but to be fair, it isn't very far from the house. Super friendly staff that knows their stuff, great prices, tons of different styles. Before I went here I shopped pretty much exclusively at Express for clothing, but the Van Heusen outlet is my new back up. Plus, they have the fan forum online for the 2010 Pro Football Hall of Fame selections.  Great clothes and football passion. Nice.
5	This is my go-to place in the Las Vegas Premium Outlets: South. Prices are great and if you are patient enough, you WILL find something worth buying! Staff are friendly and pretty helpful when you are looking for something specific.The prices at this store are better than its Northern counterpart (e.g. I found a tie here 70% off that was just 50% off in the original Premium Outlets). She may not be the prettiest of stores, but she definitely has the best personality.
1	Worst customer service ever.  Staff is either inexperienced in customer service or just doesn't care.  Management is rude and gives the impression that they just don't want to be there.  This place is the prime example of how not to treat customers.  How hard is it to smile and ask your customers if they need help finding something?  Finally, staff spends way too much time putting items back instead of helping customers.  I will not be back.
