5	One can see this massive tower from miles away but it's helpful to know that there's actually a bank here and it's not just an office building! I'm new to the area and don't know anyone so it was especially refreshing when the greeter smiled and welcomed me to Wells Fargo. The teller was equally friendly and helped me through a slightly tedious banking issue. It's nice to know that people are friendly wherever you go. Will definitely come back to this branch as it's very close to my new apartment. :)
3	They take extremely long! Being the only bank near the strip they should be fully staffed. As a Merchant I'm expected to be in the merchant line but its always closed and they never say who is available to help. So one stands in the regular line but gets told to move to another line. Get it together Wells Fargo! Have clear signs and a designated area.
5	This has to be the most courtiest people in here.  Everybody is overly nice and very warm.  Love the service!  Will be back here next time I'm here.
