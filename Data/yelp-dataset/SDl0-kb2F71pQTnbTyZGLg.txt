4	A friend bought me flowers from this shop three weeks ago and they are still in wonderful condition and nowhere near done. The shop sells a mixture of floral gifts (bouquets, plants etc), scented candles, cards, jewellery and trendy but tasteful nick nacks. Owner is welcoming and offers friendly advice. On the quality of floristry alone I would recommend this shop to anyone in the centre/East of Edinburgh.
