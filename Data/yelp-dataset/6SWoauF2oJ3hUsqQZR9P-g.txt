3	There used to be a time when this was a 5 star Store. As of July of 2011, under new ownership it quickly has turned into a 1 star store. there is ALWAYS a wait to get helped as they have reduced the number of staff on hand, and I now have to wait and sign for packages or letters that I NEVER had to over a 3 year period because they don't think they will fit in my box, I have they largest box they offer. They are to lazy to know what size box a customer has so now I have to sign for anything that is over 5x5 when my box is like 10"x12" . Very Frustrating. If I weren't paid thru 2012 I would be looking for a new UPS Store! So sad!
5	The previous review for this location is sad.  The staff is very friendly, we have never had any issues with the store.  We have been using this location for 5 years now and we are very happy customers.
5	I love this store. Even during the busiest time of the year, everyone is still smiling and making you feel comfortable. I usually come in to send fax. You wouldn't believe how unpleasant experience that can be, especially when store is busy. I've never experienced any sort of discomfort, wait, or anything negative in this store. Definitely recommended.
4	This store is great all the shipping supplies you would ever need. Super cute boxes to mail presents and cute cards. Very friendly and helpful staff. Convenient location and hours. I would recommend for any shipping needs.
1	I will never again go to this franchise chain store the service was very poor hidden sign for the Internet to be used with a minimum charge of $2.50. And that's fine I guess I should have been paying attention to them to  get me wherever they can.But golly gee the lady at the front desk that was assisting me uncaring, trying to rush me because there were other people. well that's not my fault YOU are slow...... TOO BAD I COULDN'T PUT LESS STARS                  *****SAD PANDA****
