3	How do they stay open?Located in the back of the Sahara Hotel and Casino, one has to wonder when they get business here.Trying to grab a quick bite before our show on a weekday afternoon, only a handful of parties were present.  Standard cafe fare like burgers, pizza, salads, etc.  We got the Spinach & Artichoke Dip, "a creamy, cheesy blend of artichoke hearts, spinach, onion, parmesan, a hint of bacon and tortilla chips.  Served in a sourdough bowl." for $7.25 and the Nascar Burger, "a classic Black Angus 10 oz juicy flame-broiled burger." for $9.25.First off, the spinach & artichoke dip were tasty, but too small of a portion for the price.  And I wasn't too fond of the soft sourdough bowl - what's up with soft bread?  On the menu, it says, "place in the center of the table and dive in!"  Well, it's definitely not big enough to share.We asked for the burger to be medium well, but it came out more well done.  There's a problem when you can't even get the burger right.  It had a decent flavor it in though, and it was also on a soft bun too.  The fries had a deep color that reminded me of Arby's curly fries, but without the seasoning.  Service was a bit slow, not on our waitress's part, but on how long it took for the food to come out.  (Were they killing the cow in the back?)  The place needs some better lighting, maybe they are trying to save on the electric bill because I found it to be too dark for my tastes during the day.Overall, spend your money elsewhere.  When you're hungry on the strip, don't get sucked into bad casino cafes 'cuz you'll feel even more ripped off.2.5 stars.(Pics of our lunch posted!)
2	So horribly misplaced in this classic casino.  I so hope the new owners make efforts to rip it out and reorganize this whole (large) section of the casino.
1	After attending the 2008 NASCAR race (at Las Vegas Motor Speedway), my nephew and I decided to check out the NASCAR Cafe.  We could not tell you how the food was because we left after forty minutes of waiting.  Bottom line...this place sucks!
3	I went to the NASCAR Cafe during a NASCAR race, figuring that would be the only time the place would really be interesting. Based on my experience, I'm probably right. It was a lot of fun to be in there with the race going on and the joint packed with other NASCAR fans. There was an emcee at the bar keeping the excitement level pretty high. The service was a little on the slow side, but that was okay. It just meant I got to watch more of the race. The food was fine. I'd compare it to what you can get at Applebees or Chili's. If you park at the Sahara garage, you have to walk all the way back to the front of the casino to get to the cafe. I don't think I'd come back unless it was to watch another NASCAR race with some of my racing fans.
1	Just dreadful.
2	A lot of the food here is sold by the pound or half pound.  We went for lunch during a break between seminars at a convention and they service was abysmal.  The place was not very busy, but it took 5-10 minutes after being seated before a server showed up.  I got the fish and chips (they shouldn't call curly fries "chips") and the fish wasn't bad, actually it was pretty good (saved the review from a single star).  There was a mountain of curly fries that came along with it that I didn't feel I even put a dent in.  When we got the bill, our server disappeared for over 15 minutes, and we ended up tracking her down at the bar and asking if we could please pay so we could leave.  She then asked the bartender to take care of us and she went back to the kitchen.  I'll never return and this kind of experience it the type that makes me warn others away.
4	Fox 5 Vegas has a bit with a cute reported named "Extreme Amy."  This morning she was at Nascar Cafe trying to eat the B3 Burrito.  Six pounds, 24 inches long and if you can finish it, it's free.  Well Amy got me, she got me, I had to go.  My husband and I left the burrito to the experts but the food we did order was really good.  We started off with a funny mix of curly chocolate covered pineapple fries.  Yeah it sounds odd, but mixed together it is really good.  The chocolate has got a bit of a spice to it and mixed with the juice of the pineapple it's an interesting explosion of sweet, salty and spice.       I got the double hot dog meal.  While the regular dog was good and the bun was fresh, the polish dog was not edible.  It came with cole slaw, which was really crunchy and had a spicy after taste to it.  The iced tea was really strong, just how I like it.  Service was good, we were checked on several times.  When we arrived we were sent to a counter height table and when I asked for a short one, it wasn't a problem.  This would be a great place to take all those out-of town guests.  I'm not a big drinker but the bar prices seemed fair, actually all the prices seemed decent.  Someday we will be back to conquer the B3.
2	OK, so my business partner and I are at some catered event in the Golden Room at the Sahara.  Dinner was so so, but it was a meet and greet with an important vendor and we got toasted beforehand making the bad food slide down more easily.  Afterwards, we wanted to gamble on the cheap so we decided to head downstairs thinking it would be easier to find a $10 table here than back at the Mirage.  We were kind of right.  All of the tables in this part of the Sahara were not $10....they were a buck.  $1 blackjack & roulette....... and penny slots.  The funny thing about penny slots here was that they only take bills, not coins.  OK, so I thought it was funny.Anyway, we are not big gamblers....my partner especially.  In fact, I had to give him some quick pointers when he put $2 on black and $2 on red on the same roulette spin.  Classic.  You can't make this stuff up.(Hey Mickey, what about the Nascar Cafe!!!!).  OK, OK....While playing, we see a huge sign about the 3 Pound Burrito at the Nascar Cafe just a few feet away.  "Eat it all and it's free!!"  (See the photo....No, that is not me.)  They make you sit in the middle of the room, under a spotlight, with a velvet rope around the table.  It's actually $19.95 if you don't finish.  I would actually pay $19.95 to see a good buddy attempt the feat, but I would not drive him home.  I value my car's interior too much.I tell you what, people say you get a huge ego boost by walking through Walmart and seeing the collection of people.......You gotta try this place.
4	A BLT with 1lb of bacon...what else is there to say, I had the BLT and it was AMAZING!!!I am not a fan of most of the toppings on the B3 Burrito so this was my eating challenge. $11.99 might be a little high but it was well worth it. The Bacon was delicious, the sourdough was toasted to perfection and the slaw on the side was really good, plus come in it's 1lb of bacon on a BLT...who isn't going to love that???
2	We came here b/c of my cousins who watches man vs. food. They wanted to try the B3 burrito, but unfortunetly they had that only for competition. My boyfriend tried the baby b3 but said it tasted like a burrito you would heat up in the microwave, not good. I got the clam chowder in a bread bowl and also fries covered with chocolate and pineapples, not bad and not great. We primarily came here b/c of the man vs. food hype of burrito, but turns out to be a thumbs down.
1	Let me get this right... It's called the NASCAR Cafe and Sunday is race day, right? So why in the heck would I go to watch AND hear the race at the NASCAR Cafe when all but one of the 15 TVs you have on is the race and the other 14 have football on including the audio blaring from some game I don't care about.Dale Senior must be rolling over in his grave.
4	The summary: Adorable decor and genuinely nice staff.The story: Darling is a huge NASCAR fan so we made the 3 mile hike to Sahara from Paris.  Showed up at 8pm on a Tuesday evening and the place was pretty empty.  First impressions were that everything is dirt cheap (Especially after Excalibur and Paris.)  I ordered the two hot dog entree with curly fries and chili for $8-9.  The fries came out naked but I mentioned it to the server and he promptly returned with two huge tubs of chili.  They were really good (both at the restaurant and as a cold midnight snack later) and very close to Jack in the Box curly fries.I was unfortunately only able to finish 1 hotdog and a few of the giant mountain of fries (think McDonald's Super Size).  Our waitress was really warm and sweet.   She took the initiative to offer me a box and bag, lids for all my sauces/dressings/chili, and a set of plastic cutlery (probably realizing we were going home to a hotel room.)  And somehow she managed to do all of this without seeming pushy or tip-grubbing.  We felt really really taken care of and left the establishment in a great mood, which helped lead to an awesome Vegas night overall.
3	After watching the Warrior's game at the Terrible Casino and still being early, I've decided to drive straight down Paradise Blvd and check out the other casinos that is located at the tail-end of the strip and only 10 minutes away from the Terrible Casino and my room at the Platinum Hotel. After inducing a large amount of cloud of second-hand smoke, I was a little hungry and decided to check out the NASCAR Cafe, inside the Sahara Hotel and Casino. The gift shop is located next to the restaurant and bar. Also displays of NASCAR's memorablia's showcased on the lobby including my pose with the late Dale Earnhardt's #3 Mr. Goodwrench car. You can tell Las Vegas is big on NASCAR. I was sitting at the bar. While reading the menu and refreshing my memory on a past episode from the Man v Food, the restaurant is best known for their B3 Burrito; a 6lb, 24 in. burrito. But since it was late at night, "I couldn't do it!" So I ordered the Fish and chips for $10.00. The dish has four halibut-fillets battered with beer and cooked to a golden brown with a side of curly fries. Nothing too fancy about the fish dish.  I also had two Cranberry and Vodka drinks for $8.00 each. The price of the cocktails seems questionable. I hope the bartender uses good vodka for my drinks. The bar also have a special on a 144 oz pitcher of beer starting at $20.00 for domestic beer and more for imported. With a huge selection of beers, I might try that one day to along with that B3 burrito, in which many of you are disappointed that I didn't try. This review is incomplete untill I try that huge burrito.
4	Relaxed, fun, and unique atmosphere!  Located in the Sahara hotel, one that I had not been at since I was a little girl, I was curious at what this place would be like in an older hotel.  Nascar Cafe was surely unique, and FUN!Love Mexican food? Think you can finish a huge burrito, the size of a baby, in 90 min? You are probably thinking what?!! Yep, its like I said, a 6 pound Big Baddass Burger. Do you think you could be up for the challenge?  If you eat all of it in 90 min, its free, but I am sure you still have to "pay" for what you eat, and might get sick!  I saw one guy start his venture, but shortly had to leave after. Did great a pic of it :)Love beer? Order a 120 oz maybe it is beer stick. Choose your fav beer on tap and share with your friends, or try to do it all on your own. Fun places, didn't get to try the food though :)Also....
1	Years ago when the Sahara Hotel & Casino 1st added the Nascar Cafe & Speed the Ride I came here for a burger and for the life of me I can't recall if it was good or bad.I decided to bring my son here for some video game fun and a bite to eat. When we arrived a B3 challenge was getting started and a crowd quickly gathered to take photos and videos. Before we left 2 people had tried and failed the Challenge.We ordered some soft drinks to start. (they serve PEPSI) but the popular drink seemed to be the 180oz Tower of Beer. Almost every table had one.The menu is just bar food with American & Mexican options(Burgers & Burritos). We ordered Chicken Fingers and a MONSTER 1 pound BLT sandwich both with fries.It took awhile for the food to come out and when it did it was not impressive at all:(The chicken fingers were clearly overcooked. They almost snapped they were so dry and crisp. NO seasoning and The fries were cheap frozen fries with no salt or seasoning.The BLT had ALOT of bacon but it was the cheap stuff not fully cooked NOT crisp like a BLT should be. VERY little tomato and lettuce -definitely disproportionate to the sandwich and the bacon-mayo(GROSS!!!) The fries cheap frozen curly fries with NO salt.Just plain bad bar food and VERY pricy-$35 for 1 adult 1 kid. Neither of us ate 1/2 our meals and the service was sketchy at best.NOTE: The B3 challenge ONLY cost $20 if you FAIL + you get a T-shirt. IT would be worth it if the FOOD wasnt so damn BAD:(
1	Oh boy. I cant say one good thing about this place. Thats really sad. The service was horrible. Is this one of those restaurants that encourages bad service? That sure is what it felt like.We waited patiently for our table and were seated after 45 minutes. That was ok, as its not their fault that their were packed. But then, we sat there with no menus for 15 minutes. We tried to get the servers attention but they did a really good job of avoiding us. Servers were just walking around and werent really making themselves useful. Finally, my sisters boyfriend walked over to where the menus were and brought them to us himself. Ok, at this point we are a little irritated, but its nothing that can't be fixed with I dont know...an apology, acknowledgement of their crappy service, or good food. However, we got none of the above. Heck, we didnt ever get a smile.We sat there for a total of 25 minutes before they decided to stop by our table to take our drink order. At that point we were also prepared to order our food. I tried ordering the 6lbs burrito which is what we came here to try. But, I was told it was for competition only and I couldnt order it unless I was competing. i asked if I could just pay the $20 for the burrito, but was told I couldnt. So, I ordered the small version of it. We ordered chili-cheese fries, jalapeno poppers, and the polish and italian dogs. I also ordered beer and birthday shots, but I never got the shots, which sucked because it was my birthday and our last opportunity to celebrate as a group in Vegas.Anyway, the burrito was really gross, tasted really processed and just plain nasty. How can you screw up a burrito? No flavor at all except processed cheese...ugh! The fries were burned and the dogs were too. It was just a crappy experience over all.
1	If I could give negative stars I would. We came to see if we could order the B3 and share the burrito. They said no, but they had a small version of the burrito.... stupid. So a few of the people we were with were vegetarian, including my GF. I realize they don't have many items on the menu for vegetarians but they were not willing to compromise... we were told that the 'Spinach dip" was vegetarian.... not a good item for dinner.... The Beans their have meat in them so be careful if you are vegetarian. My GF asked for a salad with no meat, but they were gonna charge her for the $13 dollar salad minus meat. We told them we should not have to pay that if we are only getting veggies... no veggie salad option at all. No grilled Cheese, Veggie Burgers or anything of the sort. we finally ordered some items. 45-55 minutes later no food... there was only two other groups. we decided to leave before the food came out. The Server was very nice and I felt so bad for her but we will NEVER be back. Her Boss on duty has no Customer Service skills... Avoid this place.... The Worst.
2	Damn you Man v. Food for taking us to this crappy restaurant for lunch.The only reason my friends and I came here was so we could try to convince one of our friends to try the B3 Burrito challenge.  It's 6 lbs. of burrito that needs to be consumed entirely within 1.5 hour, otherwise it will cost a bit over $20 to pay for it.So needless to say, we were all stoked when we entered.  The decor was decent, and the menu itself was really limited to American bar foods, and is definitely not vegetarian friendly (my friend ended up getting the pineapple chocolate covered fries, which surprisingly works).  Our server was genuinely nice and welcomed us warmly, but unfortunately, the rest of our experience really sucked.1. The food took over twenty minutes to come out.  The restaurant wasn't even that busy, so I didn't get why it would take so much time.2. Once we got our food, we realized 3/4 of  the curly fries we ordered were no longer appetizing.  Something about them made us really uneasy to eat them.3. The burrito challenge took us over thirty minutes of waiting because not only does it take 15 minutes to prepare one, but some douche took our friend's spot and started eating the damn thing, even after coming later.  Our server apologized, and we definitely sent bad karma along his way (he didn't succeed btw, not even close).4. Some snobby group of middle-age men kept talking smack about our friend during his burrito challenge.  Booo.The food was expensive and not even good.  We threw all of our fries away, and ended up just watching out friend tackle the challenge.  Unfortunately, he was owned by the burrito, but for being hella hungover and ending up throwing up in the nearby trash can, he got a lot further than the guy that took his burrito.HA!  Karma sucks huh?  Oh well, at least my friend left with a hot pink weenie shirt.  He's forever in Vegas now... unless they decide to revamp this restaurant.In short, only go for the burrito challenge commodity (which btw, is pretty gross from what my friend said... shredded pork = no bueno).  Although one star for the kind waitress, you were pretty tight!
2	Three words: BIG. BADASS. BURRITO.Really, that's the only reason to venture to the Nascar Cafe... that and if you're already in the Sahara to take advantage of $3 blackjack.I ordered the BLT - man-sized portion.  Not gonna lie, the man-sized portions are enough for at least 3 people - 2 if you're really hungry.  Sadly enough, you have almost half left over and don't feel like it's worth saving, AT ALL.  My friends and I had so many curly fries and half-sandwiches left over that (even in our drunken munchies stage) we didn't dare touch again.  They are definitely NOT vegetarian friendly.  My friend couldn't order ANYTHING.  There wasn't even anything that you could ask for without meat that would still be semi-decent.  One of my friends decided to do the B3 challenge that we saw on Man v. Food.  6lbs of burrito, filled with beans (lots of it), shredded beef, guacamole, sour cream, and just a lot of shit basically.  You get 90 minutes to try.  If you do - you not only get the burrito for free, but you also get unlimited rides at the Sahara rollercoaster.  Not my idea of fun, but an interesting novelty nonetheless.  I thought that the food challenge would be more exciting, but it wasn't, and I was almost relieved when my friend began to heave because it meant we could finally get on with our Vegas trip. Overall, not really worth our time, and probably not worth yours - unless YOU can take on the B3... but trust, it is nasty looking as hell.
3	Food was decent and the tower of brew is a must. Haven't been man enough to try the big burrito challenge or any of the other all you can eat treats they have. With many TVs this was going to be the place to watch the 2010 Super Bowl with their all you can eat and drink party. Unfortunately, no one from the restaurant of casino or hotel told us we had to prepay for tickets for the event, which would have been helpful to know before we waited in line for an hour. An hour we could have used to infuse our livers with beer from another bar.
1	YUCK.After seeing this place on Man vs Food, i wanted to go there and try the Burrito, so i got the miniture $10 one. One of the Worst Burritos I've ever had! Im so glad i decided not to take the challenge...The hot wongs were dry and didnt have flavor. It took forever to get our food. I think the best part was the Curly fries, those were very good thats why they piled them on!! cuz they know their food sucks...NEVER AGAIN!..Should've just gone to the Bellagio Buffet!
1	Shame on you Adam Richmond for having this place featured on Man Vs. Food.  This is the only reason I went there a little while back.  The place is horrible.  No good food to speak of.  Fast food burritos and chili taste better.It's Yelp rating is well earned.  Spread the word.  I'd give it 0 stars if I could.  Hope it closes!
3	This review is for 3.5 stars, all things considered. This is one of the places (casinos) in which my mom can use her points to pay for the food (essentially, a comp) so we just take care of the tip. This is a better place to eat in this casino (the caravan cafe's just ok), except they don't offer milkshakes on the simple menu (my nephew loves milkshakes). I should mention that we did eat here once before because my MIL worked at the casino for so long (before coming here somewhat regularly with my family). This is a popular crowded place so there will always be a wait for the food. Service depends on your server- we've had both ends of the spectrum. Gratuity is automatically added when you have a party of 6- however, when my toddler nephew was counted as an adult, the manager took it off. There are two prices listed on the menu- club holders get a discount. Fun atmosphere for Nascar fans, with many tv's all around for the spectators.Here's the skinny on the food: the clam chowder bowl is enormous- big enough to share, the philly cheese steak is very messy to eat (on the gloppy side), the burgers are iffy (sometimes not cooked as ordered), the nachos is perfect for a large group to share- ginormous (ordered it once and it didn't even look like I ate it), the fish and chips- large portions, fries tend to be on the excessive side, the onion rings are pretty good and served in a stack, the chicken fingers (not heavily battered, BTW) can be ordered in two sizes. There is a really good appetizer combo that is nice to share with a crowd (Group Food Idea: nachos & appetizer combo). The burrito is as huge as it appears on "Man Vs. Food" (my sister was on that episode, for a few seconds)- didn't have it, but seen it many times- many people lose.
3	The food here is actually good in my opinion, despite other reviews. The portions are pretty big and the prices are decent. I got the spinach & artichoke bread bowl, which was huge! I barely made a dent in it, but I thought it was really tasty. We also got the chocolate pineapple fries, because we were curious about them. Well, they were delicious!! What a great combination! While the food is good here, it isn't great. It's just typical bar food. Also, I don't really like the atmosphere of this place. It's pretty old, cheap, and cheesy looking. Nonetheless, I would probably come back here if I was in the Sahara. Overall, it's just alright.
2	Ok so this place's claim to fame is that they have this oversized burrito that was featured on the Man vs. Food TV show.  Not only does that burrito look disgusting but seeing someone actually try to eat the stupid thing in person really makes me excited to eat here.  Not.Anyway, I was hungry and hungover so what a better cure than to have a beer with a cheeseburger.  Well, the beer was cold...Burger sucked.  Overcooked, no seasoning, I couldn't finish the thing.  Service was courteous and not too slow - we sat at the bar.They should really have a private viewing area for that damn burrito because I do wonder if having it right there when you walk in, if it actually makes people turn away from eating here...
1	Breakfast service was bad, French Toast isn't great.  Omelettes were good.
2	What brought my group of friends out to the Nascar Cafe was the Man Vs. Food show on the Travel Channel. We were watching it while getting ready and deciding where to eat in our hotel room. It so happened to show Vegas spots and a burrito sounded good at the moment so we took a cab out the the Sahara and then to find out that our guy friends weren't able to order the huge burrito to eat at our table.To our disappointment, they told us that they would have to go up to the counter and eat it there.. YEAH where EVERYONE in the restaurant can watch. Very awkward. So no one ended up doing the burrito challenge. Most of us ordered the burger and curly fries, which was okay, pretty big portions of everything, curly fries were good, sadly better than the burger itself. Two of the guys got the regular sized burrito which was decent, and better than expected.Beware: we asked for ranch sauce thinking it'd be on the house, but they charge for it, I guess like any other restaurant... especially in Vegas.
1	darn it, wish I would have looked at this before sitting down to eat here. It took an hour for us to get our food served. Food was ok if you like a pound of curly fries served with everything. Mine was ok, ordered fish and chips but looked like the kind you buy at the frozen food section. But I was so hungry I ate them all. Prices seemed overly high considering the wait time and the quality. Also, had some crappy service from the nearby arcade people after buying some ride tickets for virtual nascar, had to get a refund after waiting an hour there. Thats why we chose the cafe cuz we were tired and hungry. Would definitely advise NOT to eat here or use the arcade services.
3	I've had the prime rib special at the NASCAR Cafe twice, and both were really good.  The last time was on December 2nd or 3rd, and the first time was back in November of 2010.  The most recent time I asked for the mashed potatos and they were really good.  Mixed vegetables plus the slice of prime rib.  For $9.99 it is a good value.  You have to have a Club Sahara card to get the discount.I've had the fish and chips there as well, and they were good.  That was a while back.. September or October of 2010.OK, so the place isn't fancy, and the beers can get pricey ($6.00 for the Guiness I had - recommend playing a bar slot machine to skip the beer fees; or grab a $1 beer before you reach the Cafe) but its next door to $1 Black Jack and some of the other attractions that are at Sahara.  I generally don't visit other Strip-based casinos... I visit the Sahara since my wife and I were married at Sahara back in 2006, and overall the hotel and NASCAR Cafe are a good value.
1	The Nascar Cafe delivers exactly what you would expect from such an establishment. We walked in and seated ourselves as there was no one at the front desk to help us. The hostess arrived eventually and explained to us that our waitress was on "an errand" and would be back in 10 or 15 minutes. As we waited with no service and not even a water, we took turns guessing where our dear waitress may have absconded to. Perhaps she was running off to buy cigarettes? Maybe a trip to pick up her child from daycare? Who knows what urgent errand could have been so pressing as to drag her away from her important job as a waitress at Nascar Cafe. Eventually another waitress came up to the table and introduced her sunny self with a "Did you want to order something?" How pleasant. We were charmed. Unfortunately we did order the 180 oz. Beer Tower. This took approximately 30 minutes to arrive at our table. However at 34$ it was a great deal and we were reasonably pleased with the new acquisition. However this pleasure was most assuredly derived from the thrill of waiting 45+ minutes and FINALLY having something show up at the table. I will say the Tower itself was grimy and looked as if it had never been washed. After about another 20 minutes of watching waitresses and staff members walk by our table, our waitress with the mysterious errand showed up. She was actually very sweet and a solid B+ server. Things had begun to turn around. We managed to corral her and place our order. Jalapeno Poppers were fresh-tasting, piping hot and exactly what you would expect. No complaints here. We polished them off with gusto. Of course at this point we were starving. The food eventually arrived about 30 minutes after the appetizer and it was nothing special. Not noticeably bad but nothing to write home about either. Clam Chowder was thick and tasty with almost no actual clams present. 1 lb. "Baby B3" was full of toppings but nothing you couldn't get at a standard Mexican place. Coleslaw was surprisingly tasty and crunchy with a nice amount of dressing. We were looking for a fun, kitschy theme-restaurant experience and got the worst version of this industry staple. We will never go here and again. It may be the absolute worst service for the least amount of pay off we have ever experienced.
3	It's our first day in Las Vegas for my best friend's 21st birthday. We spent a solid five hours walking down the Strip, mingling with the crowd, and popping inside the casinos/bars. While walking to the Sahara we both felt that untimely rumble in our stomachs. It was that rumble that happens when you're about to die of hunger. While walking through the casino we stumbled upon the Nascar Cafe and I immediately remembered it from Man V. Food. Adam Richmond attempted the B3 (Big Badass Burrito) Challenge. It's a six pound, twenty-four inch burrito. When we walked inside we passed the window display that proudly presents the challenge in all of its glory.We told our server that we both wanted to attempt the challenge. We then told him that we knew we weren't going to finish so we didn't want to make a big deal about it. He then told us "We have to make a big deal." Awesome. We were then escorted over to the "Challenge area" where two tables we waiting for us (one had a Man V. Food cover displaying the challenge).After about ten minutes of waiting and sweating bullets, out of nowhere we were blind sided. We heard over the loud speaker the voice of our server. Great. "Attention everyone! We have two men that are attempting the B3 Challenge. They have ninety minutes to finish a six pound, twenty-four inch burrito. It's made with four extra large tortillas, shredded beef, beans, rice, jalapenos, sour cream, guacamole, cheese, chives, olives, nacho cheese, and covered in an enchilada sauce." Whoa whoa whoa! My friend and I were then bombarded with all of the other diners gathering around us, taking tons of photos, and joking about how crazy we were. Then came the burritos. My god. They were ginormous. No, wait, ginormous doesn't do them justice (see photos).The pitchers of water and seemingly minuscule forks were all we had to help us tackle these mammoth burritos. For the first seventeen minutes we ate continuously. After that we had the feeling that Adam Richmond describes as the "food wall". We couldn't take another bite. Now remember, we have ninety minutes to finish the entire thing. After these first few minutes we took about four or five bites before the time ran out. Even those bites were near impossible to swallow. The ninety minutes seemed to fly by though especially because people were constantly coming up to us and asking us about the burritos. Each and every one of them were in complete amazement in regards to the size and also at our sheer stupidity for even trying to complete the thing. We were also constantly bombarded with flashes from the tourists' cameras. We were almost like celebrities!After the ninety minutes were up, we held our heads in shame while also holding in our puke. I don't mean to be graphic, but it's definitely justified. Our server came by and handed us our shameful T-shirts (The front says "Certified Weenie" and the back says "I was defeated by the B3 Burrito") and again, our picture was taken. This time it was different though. It wasn't a passing tourist or one of the many people cheering us on from the bar (thanks guys if you're reading this!). No, instead it was our server taking our Wall of Shame photo. Ugh.The burrito itself was actually really good. Although the shredded beef and enchilada sauce were pretty salty. This review is slightly biased because now every time I think of the burrito I get sick to my stomach. The experience, the meeting of tons of random strangers, as well as the millions of laughs we had during the ninety minutes is definitely a 5/5 star rating. However, the burrito itself is only a 1/5 rating. The burrito was extremely tasty and a normal human-sized serving would probably have a higher rating. But as I said before, just the thought of the burrito brings back my shameful failure as well as the nauseating feeling I had for the rest of the day.
2	The Nascar Cafe has one redeeming quality--a decent beer selection. They've got a few microbrews on tap like Rogue, Sam Adams, and Sierra Nevada in addition to the standard fare. For a Northeasterner like myself, this warms my heart.The food and service doesn't warm anything. It makes my heart return to its cold, frigid Boston temperature. Soon, I will remember that I'm sitting in one of the worst hotels in Vegas, in a cafe with a namesake that stems from the worst sport in history. Not even the four guys competing in the 8-pound burrito contest will make me smile.
1	This place does not deserve a star!  We drove out there specifically to watch our friend eat the B3 burrito from the Man vs Food challenge.  The day before, another friend specifically went to the manager and asked what needed to be done to accomodate the 3 would be challengers and the 20 people prepared to watch.  They said, "Nothing.  Just show up".  Which we did!We were told that they were too busy to make the 3 burritos and that we could check back in 1/2 hour.  Too busy?  Half the tables were empty and yet, they weren't too busy to try and take food orders for the 20 of us that went there to support our friends!   By the way, 1/2 hour later, they weren't any busier but still could not make the burritos.I will never go back there and tell all my friends to avoid it like the plague!  What a waste!
2	Definitely a crappy bar. I didn't expect much and that is what I got.
2	I had a rueben that tasted old. My friend did the 6lb burrito challenge and couldn't finish it.. he said it was too junky. The customer service there is amazing but the food is just nasty.
3	Coming back from LA we decided to stop by here and try the B3 burrito but you can only order it if you try to do the challenge and eat the entire 6lb burrito. They do offer miniature B3's that weigh 1lb each. It's the same ingredients and toppings just smaller. I thought it was really good. It did seem like the service was slow and it's was in the middle of the afternoon on a Sunday so they were not busy but did enjoy the food. Our waitress was very nice and did take care of us eventually. I would eat here again. Thought the food was good.
1	We wanted a quick bite, didnt want to go to a restaurant for a sit down so we chose to eat here.   13 minutes later, no waiter or even just a busboy to take our drinks or even just to say hi.  We finally get our food, I ordered a chicken fried steak, I figured hard to get a chicken fried steak wrong.  Wrong!  Defenitely not worth the bill we paid for here.
4	Lotta haters on here but every time I've been to the Nascar my experience has been pretty good.  They've got Newcastle which was cool and the food is more than decent.  It's a bar, they're going out of business and it's the Sahara so why does everyone on here expect EXCELLENT food?!  Come on you've either never been to Vegas or you're just flat out ignorant.  The wait and bar staff are both very nice and didn't have a problem separating my checks for alcohol and food (I have to expense the food only).  A lot of people complain about the rules of the B3 Burrito but IT'S A COMPETITION EATING CHALLENGE!  You're not supposed to share it, Adam Richmond didn't pull that business...of course he didn't finish it but some people have!  If you can't man up and eat this massive burrito yourself, just order the 1 pounder bet you can't even finish that haha.  Saw another complaint about being forced to eat it at the bar, once again, it's an eating challenge it's meant to make a spectacle of whoever is eating it.  You really think you're going to eat a 6lb burrito quietly over in the corner in Vegas?  No sir.  Anyways, I stayed right at the Hilton GV for 25 days and I frequented this place because I knew they were shutting down along with Sahara soon so I wanted to get my time in, especially since it's so close.  Don't believe every review you see on here, check it out for yourself and get a Sahara cup to take home cuz on the 16th of May, you won't be able to do that any more.  Check out the BLT I loooved it!
1	WOW...Service was slow, but nice at least.  There was really no one there when we went, I have no clue what took so long.  The menu isnt that impressive, I got a tuna sandwich with fries.  I make WAY better tuna salad then that and the fries were cold and tasted like they were made 10 hours before I ordered.  I only took a few bites and my stomach hurt later that night, no good!They have this burrito challange if you can eat a 6 pound burrito you get it free, otherwise it is $20 bucks, a few people tried while we were there, no winners. lol  Anyway, this place sucks, way too expensive too.  Try someplace else.
3	Stopped for dinner and it was slow time and service was still slow. The food on the other hand was plentiful and delicious. Had a Ruben with some yummy almost 1/2 pound of meat on it, and the curly fries were yum too. The price was fair too.
2	Sat down and was checking out everyones food. Looks ok, yeah we'll eat here. So my husband orders a beer, they don't have it. Ok he'll have this other beer on tap, NOPE don't have that either. wth? The handles are on the tap thingy. So they lady unscrews all the ones that are out. 4 out of 5 were out. wth? So my hubby got stuck with bud light. Then I order a hot chocolate. She walked around the corner still stirring it. Yuck tastes like chalky water. So I send that back and ask for a pineapple juice. They lady once again comes around the corner, this time licking her lips. Hands me my drink and says yeap that's good. My husband and I look at eachother. So I grab another straw and yep it's good but kind of hard to mess up pineapple juice. Now to the food, no untensils no condiments, had to ask for everything! So I ordered a short stack of pancakes (2) with a side of ham. Pancakes were just ok, I can do bisquick better. Ham steak was cooked on the same grill as the regular steak so had a charbroiled steak taste. Yuck.My husband ordered a chicken sandwich which came with curly fries. He truely believes the fries were frozen and the chicken sandwich too. He ate it but only because starvation kicked in. Which I would have went back to the BACKSTAGE DELI @ THE LUXOR_yum!Skip this place not worth the time or money. Hit a food court if you're that desperate.
3	I stopped here for dinner on 4/16 after riding Speed with fellow Yelpers.  I had the Reuben sandwich.  It came with curly fries.  Service was top notch.  Everyone was very pleasant, very competent, and they stopped by to see if I needed some more iced tea or anything else.  Service was prompt!The sandwich was quite good.  The corned beef tasted good.  If anything, it could have used a bit more sauerkraut.I'm glad I took the time to try this place before it closes.
4	I'm actually surprised by the NASCAR Cafe.I'm not a NASCAR fan.  At all.  I was generally like "Pfft, whatever" about trying this place out, though they do serve 6 pound burritos.  Think about it: It's like you would be consuming a small child.  You know what?  Scratch that.  It's probably best that you don't, as it's a little creepy to conceptualize.But since the Sahara is closing, I figured that I should be open-minded and give it a try.  They specialize in "Big" food.  Six pound burritos, one pound burgers, stupidly huge beer towers.... You get the point.I ordered the hot open-faced turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes.  Wow.  Really?  That thing was GOOD.  Like really, really good.  Paolo D. looked at my plate and told the waitress "I'll have what he's having".They also serve 1 pound versions of their child-sized burrito (I had to put THAT image back in your head, didn't I?).  I think I'll be trying that.  Of 4,000+ people to take the burrito challenge, apparently only 34 people have ever completed it.So I've been "Pfft, whatever" about this place for years, and it's sad that I only discovered the food here a month before it closes, but I'm glad that I got over myself enough to try it.Still doesn't get me to do anything about being interested in NASCAR, but I'm sure I'll pull through somehow.
1	Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me!As Seen On TV. Have you ever been f***ed over by an informal that turned out to be a scam? Not me. Have you ever religiously vowed to try out Man Vs Food locations with out yelping them first? I have.. :(. Seriously!?! WTF was I thinking!!!! As a Yelp a Elite, I was questioning my status. I thought I should simply resign from Elite for what I did. Had I read one or two reviews. I could have save myself heartache and pain. **WARNING RANDOM RANT AHEAD!! Viewers discretion is advised.**STUPID TV! There's a reason I Netflix, so I don't get sucked in to stupid shows and stupid commercials. I wanted to punch someone so bad more than I hate the Verizon "Can you hear me now guy" and the Stupid retarded I'm a Mac commercials with equally as stupid Apple consumers that religious follow the Steve Jobs cult. Adam Richman, men across the nation look at you for inspiration. You are not an Guy Fieri, Andrew Zimmerman, or Anthony Bourndain, but we trust that you are one of us and not caught up in mainstream BS! I have watched your show seeing all these wonderful places on the East Coast and in Texas. My quest for Man Vs Food starts on the West Coast. Los Angeles was a disappointment nothing spectacular like LA traffic, smog, and the Lakers going to lose this year's Finals (or not make it) =). Las Vegas my second home... How could you pick this place?**Back to the Review**When you first walk in to Nascar Cafe you will see a line. You will hear little murmurs like "Wow, I can't believe I'm here..... MvF" "blah blah B3 or Big Ass Burrito". Two things come to mind when you see this place... Is Nascar really a sport? King of the Hill just came to life! I was waiting for some to say Propane and Propane accessories, but someone did say my favorite Hank Hill line... "I tell you WHat". I felt very very very out of place. Arlington, Texas is alive! I'm surprised I was not mistake for Kan. Okay Okay. I'm being harsh in a joking way of course. I did not drink too much Hater-aid and no one was raciest towards me. I apologize for being a little bitter... but please read on.After a 45 minute waiting with very very impatient people behind me, I was finally seated. Yeah! This is a long time to wait with only maybe 3 small parties in front of me. I did not see any burritos on the menu. What the deuce? I wanted a 1 lb size of the B3. (I found out later you can ask for it, thank you yelp) Instead I ordered a guacamole bacon burger. A Carl's Jr commercial was never more dead on! While eating a "fancy" 13 dollar burger I was wondering why I wasn't eating a 4 or 5 dollar Carl's Jr burger instead. Portions are big but even if I was drunk, I'd much rather hit up the cheaper local Denny's. The curl fries were slightly better than the burger. My friend ordered frozen buffalo wings. Okay, she didn't mean to get them frozen, but they came out almost that way. The chef did replace her half pound order of wings with a fresh HOT plate of 1 lb of wings. Nice up grade for an honest mistake. I tried the wings... Too bad I'm a wing specialist. The wings were hot on the outside, but still slightly under cooked on the inside. I didn't notice this until the wings became cold over time. Come on how hard are wings to make? 10-12 minutes in a fryer and add maybe 5 minutes more if frozen. My burger fell apart while I was eating it. Not in a good mouth watering way, but in a nasty way. If this ever happens to you, that means that the bread is older and the meat was not cooked correctly. I'm not sure how it was cooked... Maybe grilled, baked and boiled?....The PROS... There's always a bright side. Despite the slow slow service. My server was actually nice and in a good mood :). I appreciate that. The employee was dragging his or her feet and clearing dishes like they were the bomb squad. I heard a customer say, "They should fire everyone and hire new people." Thank you to my server. I applaud you :). This place is seriously Nascar Heaven with millions of TV playing only Nascar (and one soccer game). Or the opposite of heaven if you aren't in to Nascar. I could only image what Top Gear has to say about Nascar and driving in circles. I wish I never set foot inside of Sahara or Nascar Cafe again. If you are a guest of Sahara, I do think you should give this place try. Call me crazy, but the quality is kind of like cafeteria food. Its not great, but its decent enough that you could eat there. I think my review is a tad bias and if your food is cooked by a different chef than today I'm sure you will be fine. Thank goodness I didn't get sick. I'm writing this from my Wynn Suite and I know tomorrow is another day. Hot N Juicy and Hash House A Go Go are next. I think I saved the best for last. *I accepted any hate mail this uncensored review might have caused. Just know.. please read this review with a light heart and know I was pissed and don't take me too seriously.*
3	Surprisingly not bad. After riding the coaster a couple of times, Guy C got hungry and so we decided to get a bite at the cafe. I wasn't going to get anything. That is, until his open faced hot turkey sandwich showed up. It was huge and looked delicious! I immediately asked the lady to get me the same thing.It's certainly not the best open faced hot turkey sandwich I've ever had. That title belongs to the 24 Seven Cafe at the Palms. Still, it looked and tasted like pure comfort food. It was the perfect meal to fill my stomach in preparation for the night ahead.And of course, it also prepared my stomach for one more ride on the coaster for old times sake.
3	ok - had to go after seeing it on TV.  It was ok - got a burger and fries (no - didn't get the gigantic burrito..).  It was ok  - got lots of fries with it as well.  But nothing special; I'd expected char-broil flavor, but this was just fried.Our server was great - fast service, no problem getting refills on drinks.  While I won't go out of my way to recommend it, I don't have anything bad to say about it.  Since the Sahara is closing, not sure if this place will close or move... anyway, good but nothing special.
2	Poor, poor Nascar Cafe.  Closing down in the last month of the Sahara, an out-of-character tumor on the 60's swinging Sahara.   Their food was fast at the cost of tasting like being under a heat lamp for three hours.  For being mostly empty, it was mostly under-served.  Even the TVs were on the fritz.    Worst of all, most of the cafe is shut down!  Not that I really like NASCAR, I'm just saying.  That the Sahara is now known more for a baby-sized burrito than Louie Prima makes me a sad person.
1	Dead and should have closed wks ago. Our group of 8 thought it would be fun to eat at the Nascar Cafe. Because closure is only 5 days away they are out of everything. Two of us ordered $12.95 Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches but the meat was so salty we could not eat as they almost burned our mouth w/salt. When we complained the waitress brushed us off completely. I asked for the manager who said they did not add salt to anything and it must be their supplier. We were not offered any alternative. Flatly told us they would not make any adjustment at all in the bill. At $13 I could have had a nice lunch at many places. DON'T GO THERE!  P.S. 2 of our group were nauseous and 1 actually sick all night. Coincidence?
1	We went there specifically for the damn B3 Burrito & they said they WEREN'T HAVING IT THAT DAY. Came back the next day AND THEY SAID THE SAME THING. we were pretty upset... why advertise it if your not even going to make it. Also the burger that I ordered was Extremely OVER cooked... like Charcoal taste nasty. Although the nice waiter we had took it off our bill... it seemed like they were way to busy to really remember people who needed refills, ranch ect.... got annoying.  won't be going back ever...
