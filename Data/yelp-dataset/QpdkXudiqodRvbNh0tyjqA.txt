2	It seem that eating at the Arrowhead Mall food court is just not meant for me. My daughter & I picked this restaurant because the menu looked decent & they had the shortest line. Turns out the line was short for a reason :( They take FOREVER. I literally could have passed out, died, been reborn & gotten back to the ripe old age I am now & I'd still have been waiting for another 15 minutes! OK, so maybe it wasn't THAT long, but we were there for quite a while. The guy taking the orders kept asking me what I wanted & when I opened my mouth to tell him he'd look away & start restocking something or another,,,,, it might be me, but when you ask me a question, look at me & stay in one place. I'm just picky like that I guess. The guys cooking up the food seemed overwhelmed & they were not getting the orders out in 'order', so I was really peeved that the person who ordered AFTER me got their order before us when we basically ordered the same thing. I had to remind the guy what I was waiting for. Maybe they were new? Maybe the holiday rush just got to them? Maybe I should just never eat there again? Who knows! The maybes are infinite :)
5	Very good food and fresh. They make the food to order and it's fast. I've tried the steak teriyaki and the chicken teriyaki and both are amazing. Also, need to have the potstickers and the spicy sauce it comes with. That is a must. Will be back again.
4	I was out with my family at arrowhead mall and we grabbed a quick bite to eat.  Had a combo plate with shrimp, beef and sauteed mushrooms.  It also came with fried rice.  Everything was really good, but what I liked was the mushrooms!  Well seasoned and tender.  Will eat here again.
3	Food is decent. They cook it fresh in front of you. They are not as busy as their neighbor the panda. They have mediocre sushi, but hey it's a mall what do you expect for 6 bucks. Staff is efficient and friendly.
