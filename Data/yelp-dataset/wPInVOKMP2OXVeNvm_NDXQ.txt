5	We've ordered from Slide and Bounce Around a couple of times... We love what they offer and had a Blast every time!!
5	This year marks the 4th time we have used Slide and Bounce Around for a kids party.  The people are very responsive, they arrive when they say they will, they have everything that could possibly be needed for set up (tarps, electrical cords etc), and the equipment is always in good shape.  The setup team was very understanding and engaging when my very excited 8 year old is talking their ear off about the upcoming birthday party and they're trying to set up a 12 foot tall water slide.  I wouldn't even consider calling someone else.
