3	I went to this establishment a few years ago after a looooooooong night of debauchery during my buddies bachelor party. It's an Asian massage parlor....in Las Vegas....and it's open 24 hours a day. Bingo!To my surprise, these beautiful babies actually gave me and my buddies a pretty descent massage. Granted, it was 4:30 in the morning and we were completely plastered, but it totally relieved my sore shoulder from pulling those slot machines all weekend.....uh, yeah....I cannot confirm, nor deny any naughty activity within my group of drunk 20-somethings that morning...but I will tell you that my masseuse offered me something called a "body shampoo" for an additional $30 at the end of my rub down. I think I blacked out, because that's the last thing I remember before waking up naked in my hotel room at the Luxor. Gotta love Vegas.
3	Yup I got a massage here. It was epic and I had no idea it was an alleged "brothel." I can't believe Ruggy has been here too. I feel weird about it, but ultimately indifferent.I haven't been there in about 5 years but I thought about it today for some reason and learned it's part of a string of happy ending and unlicensed goodness. Probably won't be back ever but oh those Las Vegas memories.
5	hey...after losing a few black chips on damn BJ table and downing about 25 shots of Patron, my buddies and I (well actually just me) was feeling lonely.  so the cure for this? oh ya! it's Vegas so i headed over to this place just expecting the usual Happy Ending...well i be damn!!  i got much more than that! i cant tell u what because I dont want to get my self arrested since i have a job i need to keep.  anyways this is a cool place. okbye
