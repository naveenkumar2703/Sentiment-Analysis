3	Did a detail there, they did a good, but not oustanding job, but for a reasonable price (like $150).  Tons better than Danny's would ever do!I've had other, better, details in the area, but they were closer to $250... so comparing the quality of the work versus the price, Airpark was a good/very good value.
4	I've been here a couple times for a car wash.  Fair prices, good work.  Pretty much streak and swirl free on my black car.  Will have to give them a try on a full detail sometime.
5	They do an awesome job. Brought my black vehicle to them to buff out and detail the exterior. The car when done looked just like a brand new vehicle that I drove off the lot.Vern the owner was very friendly and very professional. I highly recommend their services.
4	Super pleased with my first time using Airpark Auto Detailing.  Fantastic job on my Jeep, it hasn't gleamed like this in a decade.  And since they share a space with the Rayco service shop, walked 10 feet to the counter and arranged for an oil change and tire rotation same day.  One-stop-shopping for me, very convenient!
