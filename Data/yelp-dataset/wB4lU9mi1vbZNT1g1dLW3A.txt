2	I used to love this bar when they had karoke!!  we went on a sat night and it looked as if it were a week day it was so dead.I hear there's a new owner which kinda explains the drastic changes. Thats not the bar i remember at all!! A bar should be full of people & have some good ol" loud music. I hope they give karoke another shot or at least a D.j.  Not sure im going back again!   :(   Romans oasis in the far west valley is were I'll go from now on!!!!
5	Great bar! Natasha makes the BEST bloody marys I've ever tasted! This bar is awesome to go to if you want to hang out and relax. Prices are more than reasonable. My favorite place to go during the early afternoon. Lot of regulars and fun friendly servers.
