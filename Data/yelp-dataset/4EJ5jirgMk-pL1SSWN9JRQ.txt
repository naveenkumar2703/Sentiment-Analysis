3	This Dunkin Donuts is one of the first to open around the Madison area.  It's located on the corner of Hwy Q and Hwy 19 in Waunakee, and is attached to the BP Gas Station that's on that same corner.  The staff was super friendly and helpful, the donuts were decent.  If you're in the area and craving a donut, give these guys a shot.

4	I've been here twice in the last week (go ahead and judge). The first time was a Sunday morning. I got donuts for the kids and a coffee for myself. Interestingly, they put in the cream and sugar for me without asking how much (to clarify, they did ask if I wanted that before putting it in). They guessed right, which was great, and the bites of donut that I mooched were very good (rainbow sprinkles and Boston Kreme).  On the second trip we got donuts for the whole family at around 9pm on a Thursday. The young man working there was very friendly (same thing on the Sunday visit though a different young person) and obliging while my kids stood there admiring the donuts instead of actively trying to pick which ones they wanted.  This location has a drive-through, though I didn't use it either time.
