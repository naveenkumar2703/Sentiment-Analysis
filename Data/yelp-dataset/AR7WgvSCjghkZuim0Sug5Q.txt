5	As a pastor, I encounter people facing great difficulty on a daily basis. Many of them wrestle with emotional, psychological and mental health issues. I recognize the limitations of my ability to address issues in short-term pastoral counseling situations and often look to more qualified professionals to assist my people in moving toward wholeness. I appreciate having someone with the professional training and personal character that Dr. Melissa Estavillo embodies to refer out to when I recognize I'm out of my expertise. I heartily recommend her to you, for your personal needs or for your list of community resources.

5	Dr. Estavillo was key in connecting us to a pre-marital counselor in our area.
5	Dr. Estavillo presented at our workshop for healthcare providers.  She was very articulate, personable, knowledgeable and helpful.  She did not require that we market her in any way.  She spoke from the heart and wanted nothing in terms of referrals in return.  She is a true professional.
