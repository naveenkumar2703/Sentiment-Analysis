5	Eric is a pool guru! My pool had not been maintained for months and was so green and thick, it was disgusting! I honestly thought that it was beyond help. Eric scheduled an appointment to look at it, showed up on time and went through various options with me. I opted to have the pool drained. He went right to work! Once it was drained he and his team scrubbed, scrubbed and scrubbed some more until the pool looked brand new! I cannot believe how sparkling it is! I might add that he worked on my pool over Memorial Day weekend so that he could take advantage of the cooler temps needed to drain the pool. I found him to be friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and reliable. He was upfront regarding prices and there were no cost surprises when he was done. I have now hired Eric to service my pool on a weekly basis. I highly recommend Four Seasons Pool Service!
5	I have been with Four Seasons Pool for over 3 years.  Eric was awesome from my initial call inquiring about  the service.  Eric is very informative, professional, and reliable.  Four Seasons pool keeps you informed of the condition of your pool with an email after every service, you will receive a personal call if there is something that needs your immediate attention.  Eric never recommends unnecessary equipment or maintenance.  My pool sparkles all year around and I have never had a problem.  I highly recommend Four Season Pool service if you are looking for quality service and fairness at a great price.
1	Called in morning on Thursday July 3, left a message. Answering machine didn't say anything about being closed for holiday, today is Monday July 7th, still haven't received a return call. Called another pool service on 3rd, they answered right away & sent someone out that day.
