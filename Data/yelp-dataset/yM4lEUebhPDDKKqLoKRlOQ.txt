5	Swimming pools... NOT CHEAP!  You find this out the hard way when you buy a foreclosed home!  Leslie's Pools have been great to me.  I've become "Norm" every time I go into there!Phil (the manager) has been GREAT!  He has been EXTREMELY helpful (just short of coming out to the house and doing it for me). ;P
4	go their for their sales/rebates!
5	I have been in this locations a couple times, they have always provided excellent service. I took my pool sweep to them, after I got it back from Checker Pool Supply and it still wasn't working. Corey the customer service rep took it apart at the counter, replaced a couple parts and had me out of the store in less than 20 minutes. They are my new pool store. They understand the importance of service
5	I grew up swimming pools in AZ, but never maintaining them.  We just moved into a house with a pool 6 months back, and Leslie's has been super helpful in teaching me the systems, balancing the water, and making small repairs to get my pool summer-ready!
5	What a wonderful place! The workers are so helpful! They were able to resize my wedding ring (bc after I gained all my baby weight it didn't really fit anymore) Thanks guys! Keep it up!
