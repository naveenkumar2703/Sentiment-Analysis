4	Quick friendly service. Very accomodating w special requests (vegan). Great egg rolls that are actually home made and hand rolled not the usual frozen sysco fare most places serve.  The food was all delicious and service was impeccable.  Very prompt and extremely polite servers.  Food was prepared quickly but at a comfortable pace, we did not feel rushed.
4	Just ate here since they re-opened.  Under new management. Food was wonderful.  Service was great!  If not on menu -- ask -- they will most likely make it.  Not much available for chinese food here in Fountain Hills and this is a nice change.  Not sure what happened with previous customers as it looks like they had a bad experience. It's too bad as we had different experience.  If not happy let them know as they will try to make it right.  Try them as I am sure you will enjoy.
4	Recently ate here, takeout, and was very pleased with food.  The orange chicken was slightly spicy and still crunchy, the brown rice was very yummy and the crab puffs have actual crab in the cream cheese - unassuming building but spectacular food.
1	I've written some reviews before, but they've always been positive.  That's not the case with this one.  We had take-out, so I can't speak to the level of service, but the food (sesame chicken, happy family, pork-fried rice) was less than mediocre -- tasteless, oily  and pricey.  We won't be giving it a second chance!
