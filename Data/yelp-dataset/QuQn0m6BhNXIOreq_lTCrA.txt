2	This place is gone but it was a decent rest stop before getting to Primm.  cheap penny arcade and slots that still paid with change not slips.  Not sure if there are plans to build a new Nevada Landing but it would be a good idea.
2	Back in the 90's to mid 00's, this was my favorite hotel with the lights chasing around the fake boat and the lights on the water wheel was just fun to watch as if it were moving. It was total a dive just like it's sister hotel across the 15, Gold Strike but it was nice pit stop and some cheap eats.The casino and hotel staff would be in cruise uniforms and the casino was always packed and full of action. Sadly this demolished in 2007 to make way for a modern and hip resort by MGM but the economy had axed out that plan.
4	I feel sorry for Nevada Landing. It is slowly withering away. It used to be a fun little stop to stretch ones legs or get a bite to eat before Vegas. Now it looks like it is dying.I hope someone does something to save this little gem.
