3	Pupusas for $1.50.  $1 only if you order at least 6 of them.  Served with a mixed greens type of salsa.  Very delicious and the salsa/sauce really gives it some dimensions.  Great deal for pupusas.
4	Delicious homemade ice cream! My favorites are the rose, cheese, and pistachio flavors. Their service is always great and they'll let you sample as many flavors as you'd like. I was very impressed by how nice they are!Their aguas frescas are also very, very good. I tried their pupusas and they were just OK, not my favorite. I will definitely be back for some sweets though!
5	The owner/chef is very friendly! The tacos are absolutely bomb especially their Al pastor and tripa. They make it really crispy and juicy so you could taste the full flavor. They have a mini food cart every Wednesday to Saturday and it makes it more authentic. Inside, they have homemade ice cream with tons of flavors! Our favorite in the office is the STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE ice cream. It's a definitely must try.
