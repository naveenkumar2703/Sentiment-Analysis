4	Situated near start pf Princess Street , large shop front with well advertised deals on offer. Had eyes tested which was done very professionaly (took 45mins).Staff very attentive and thorough to make sure i was happy with any deals on offer.
3	I have come to realise that quite a few of the chain stores I frequent all host their larger branches in the West End, and on Shandwick Place. I'm registered with the Specsavers on North Bridge, and if you were to look up that review, you'd know I'm not overly enamoured with the customer service.Once again I went in to get new contact lenses there and they had none in stock. Again. So I ordered some in. They didn't come in on time. So I asked for my prescription so I could get them elsewhere as I needed them for an upcoming 2 week trip. I was told they could phone the other Specsavers branch and they had some in stock. Voila.So down I popped to Shandwick Place and wow, it's bigger. Far bigger. Bigger selection of glasses, more staff, different desks for different requirements. The staff were really friendly and efficient too. I can't say I spent long enough in the shop to give it a fair review, but I already think I prefer this branch to the other one and despite that it's further away from my flat than the other one I think I might switch. Clarity of vision!
4	My favourite eye care place in Edinburgh. Always has super friendly service and great deals on contacts and glasses. I think they might be the cheapest as well. So for you four-eyes like me go here or any of the companies store chains all around the city!
