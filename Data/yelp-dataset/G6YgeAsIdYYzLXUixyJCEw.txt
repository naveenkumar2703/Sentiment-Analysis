1	Wow!  Dirty room.  Not vucuumed.  Extremely indifferent service.  Room smelled moldy.  Never again!
3	I would have rated the hotel a 2.5, but giving it a 3 for the price. Rooms are not suites, more like a motel with rooms having outdoor access. We stayed here Superbowl weekend, had a room on the first level by the pool, very noisy. Used the rooms fan to drown out the noise slightly. Can hear guests in the rooms connecting, running water for their shower. Can also here voices outside as they walk by and hang by the pool. Workers started sawing and drilling outside at 8am. Maybe the stay here is nicer when there aren't as many people here. Breakfast area is nice, but not enough seating for guests, go early or bring food back to your room. Food is adequate.Pros: price, comfy bed, location isn't bad. Shopping across the street. WIFI.Cons: noisy, not necessarily suites, old motel feel, slightly run down. Was a bit tricky to find, free breakfast is basic, not enough seating.
1	Customer service was mediocre.  Our guest suite had a nice set up, however, our room was hot as hell!  AC in hotel is turned off in all rooms so it took a few hours just to get it cool.  There is no elevator so we had to lug all of our stuff up and down the stairs.  We had coffee but no coffee maker?!  Ugh OK.  We asked for three extra towels but only got two... you get the picture.Lots of things turned out to be a nuisance.  Would never stay here again.
2	This hotel gets a 2 for the room being clean. It is a motel, with  outside walkways. Extremely noisy, built as a courtyard around the pool and every squeal comes right into your room ,  the common areas were filthy, trash cans overflowing. The breakfast was okay, but the staff were rude. We would not stay here again even for the price.
