3	Located on 67th ave. just north of Deer Valley, on west side of street.  This place is normally fairly clean, has a lot of customers, and has a good selection of stuff.  Only complaint is the darn loitering kids from the nearby school who dress like homeless hipster types.
1	I received an email stating that my photo order was ready for pickup at Walgreens store #4434. On arrival, I was told that the order was not yet ready and that I would have to wait 20 mins because there was a large order being printed ahead of mine. The photo clerk was very nonchalant and unapologetic about the situation. When I spoke to 2 managers on duty, the only compensation I was offered was a 10% discount on my $2.90. My time spent waiting was worth 29 cents to Walgreens. Talk about adding insult to injury. I will never shop at store #4434 ever again and I'm moving my prescription refills to a competitor.I took the time to contact Walgreens' customer service about my experience and was told to expect a call back in 2 business days. That never happened.
4	Great walgreens location with some of the friendliest staff. Zino in the cosmetics section is the bomb.Conveniently located near sprouts and a few other shops right on Deer Valley and 67th Ave.
