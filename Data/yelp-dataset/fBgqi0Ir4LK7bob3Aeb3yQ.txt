2	Callie really messed up my hair.  Places like these are like most discount hair places.... they have people who are good and those who are bad.  Gabby really does a good job.  They did take care of me when my hair got messed up and gave me the haircut for free (which I would expect).  They should give the bad haircut for free as well as the next haircut where they can fix the mess they (as a salon) created.  Will I go back.... i'll go see Gabby, but won't let Callie go near my hair.
4	I've been here twice now, and I think this is my favorite Sport Clips location.Yes, yes, it's only a haircut...  But if it isn't a decent haircut, you have to wait 3 weeks to attempt to fix it.  Anyway, Michelle did a great job.  Plus, it's conveniently located on the same corner as Dunkin Donuts...  If you have to wait in line for a haircut, it's better to wait with an iced coffee and a chocolate cream donut.
5	Lee Ann is a great professional. Haircut is excellent. Salon is spotless. Highly recommend!!
