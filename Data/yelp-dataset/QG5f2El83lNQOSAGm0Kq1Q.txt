5	Clean inside. Friendly employees. Parking lot is easy in and out. Nicely layed out and wide aisles, with good markings so you find what your looking for.
5	The best service from the pharmacy staff!!!!!
1	Today after work I stopped in to buy a bday card, I saw a few makeup items on clearance.  I pay and walk out, I realize just paid $34 and reach for the receipt, my receipt flies out of the bag and is gone.  I go back in store and ask if I could a copy of the receipt.  They print one out, yep the mascara I purchased was marked $3.99 but rang up $7.99, I ask for a refund, I'm told that's the price is correct so I decide to return the item.  At this point I'm told I can only get store credit because I don't have the original receipt (lmao at this point). Even though the receipt they printed has my debit card info and the clerk who cashed me out is vouching for me I'm not getting my money back ( I must really look like a crack whore...not even close).  The person in charge (baby talk Angela) is not trained in common sense or customer service. I chose to leave the store without any of the items and disputed the charge with my bank who are awesome. so guess what baby talk I got my money back and I won't spend one more $ in your store.
1	Came by at 9:57  wouldn't let me in even though it showed they close at 10 pm. Horrible customer service. Just drove ten min to get here
