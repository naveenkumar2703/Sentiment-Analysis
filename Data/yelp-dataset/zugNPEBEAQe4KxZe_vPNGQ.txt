4	Thank goodness for Valley Self Storage.  I have tons of stuff crammed into lockers at their facility.  The place is cooled, so your heat sensitive things aren't completely destroyed.  I have never seen a spider or any kind of bug for that matter.  I'm sure they do regular pest control which is huge.... no one wants to open a box and find something that bites or stings has crawled in and made it home.  They are extremely nice.  If you are late, or something happens to your automatic payment (happened to me) they call and make sure you are aware.  I was very happy that they did.  It would have been upsetting if they just assumed I was flaking on my contract and sold my stuff like I have heard that other storage places have done.I've been a customer there for about 6 years.  I'm very happy with them.
4	Clean and climate controlled. I have had a unit here for 10 years and they have never raised the rate. Nice owners as well.
4	I've used the storage for years. Haven't had any issues! Highly recommend going here for those looking to store stuff
5	Really nice people.  Made my move with less worries.  I recommend them to all my friends.  Valley Self Storage is my choice.
