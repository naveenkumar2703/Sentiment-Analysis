4	I usually stop off here in the morning for the occasional breakfast sandwich and coffee.The egg, cheese and sausage croissant is pretty tasty for a convenience store breakfast sandwich. Their coffees are fresh and hot and there are plenty of flavor syrups and creamers for you to use.
4	Clean store. Good-intentioned franchise operator trying to make a go of it. Hot dog condiments always stocked (onion, jalepeno, relish...but NO SAUERKRAUT for months now?), never a problem with the soda machines or nacho cheese/chili machines being empty.A revolving door of employees, sadly.  Always good variety and selection stocked, though.
2	For a 7-11, this one is very clean, fast and friendly.  I can't complain too much, but in general it seems like the other quick stop shops have better deals on drinks and other items.  I like this one because it's conveniently close to my work, but other than that I would rather hit up Chevron, Am/pm etc.
5	Ida is so damn friendly and hard working. She works her ass off with a smile. On her own, she earns five #F00 stars from me.
2	Bathroom broken. Almost nothing for condiments for hot dogs, only relish and packaged mustard and a few jalapenos. No onions, no sauerkraut, nothing. No cheese for nachos, not enough jalapenos for the nachos. Cheese machine was empty. About the only thing these days this store is good for is stuff that comes off the truck...but they have slot machines and energy drinks! If you need to use the bathroom, or are hungry, go somewhere else.
4	I like this location a lot.  The older woman who works in the morning is super nice, and very efficiant. They have a good selection here, and the store is ALWAYS clean.  The owner/manager has a huge ego though, and has been condescending to customers and employees.  that's the onlyl reason for a 4 star instead of 5.
5	This place has some new owner. Fully stocked and has some great pizza. Highly recommend you give it a second try.
