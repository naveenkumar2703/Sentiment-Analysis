1	Worst Storage Unit ever! Don't store here, and if already, VACATE IMMEDIATELY!!! Managers are rude, Owner  has the worst business skills. Customers word means nothing. Extremely Selfish, and unwilling to compromise! Apparently have never heard about "customer always being right" instead they argue with the customer and simply don't care!! I will post this everyday till the word gets out!!! VACATE, & DO NOT CONSIDER, OR THINK TWICE!!!!
1	Was shopping around for a storage space for some furniture of mine before rent a center comes and takes it away... This place just sucks. Got more for my dollar somewhere else
5	GREAT service and location. They have indoor units as well as outdoor units available. They have a 17" moving truck for you to use upon move in. They also had an awesome move in deal. I would highly recommend for your storage needs.
