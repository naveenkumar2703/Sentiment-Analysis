4	Lived here until May 2012.  One of the best communities I've experienced living at.  My apt unit was great. Parking was never an issue. I really like that this community is a small one. I've lived in other bigger communities and notice the office doesn't remember residents and are more like sales people. Here, the office staff are polite and personable.  maintenance team are fast and efficient! Paying rent was as easy as going online. Service requests can also be submitted online. My only issue had to do with a noisy downstairs neighbor that lived like zoo animals but she moved out and new normal neighbors moved in. :)
4	Nice clean grounds...always feel at home here.
5	I lived here for a year and have to say it was the best experience I have ever had living in an apartment. The common areas are always clean, there is plenty of parking available, the staff is friendly and dogs are very welcome... even Grate Danes. My neighboring tenants were all extremely friendly and I always felt safe. All in all, if I ever have to live in an apartment again I would move back in a heartbeat!
