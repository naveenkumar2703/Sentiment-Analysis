5	Dr. Longwill and his staff are top notch. I have never felt more comfortable at a dentist's office than I do here. They are very friendly and are sure to explain everything thoroughly. I live about 45 minutes from the office and I don't mind the drive, they are worth it! Sarah at the front desk always brightens my day and that is saying something when one finds themselves at a dentist's office!
5	I have been going to Dr. Longwill's office since I was in middle school...I am now in my 30s!  There is NO ONE ELSE I will go to, except Dr. Longwill and his staff, until he retires.  I've told Dr. Longwill that he better have a plan for me once he retires :).  Sara at the front desk is wonderful, Judy - one of the hygenists - is superb, and the other hygenests - who I know, but don't see as often - are amazing, as well.  Dr's assistant, Chris, is so gentle and sweet.  Dr. makes the experience of going to the dentist one that I actually do NOT dread, and I know he will take perfect care of me each and every time.  He's got great stories and will make you smile!
5	I found this dentist about 2 yrs ago. He is a great dentist - a nice guy - and good conversation between numbing and drilling (lol).
