3	It is not often that I am rendered speechless (ask my mum) but walking into the Bruntsfield Bistro, the restaurant of the Bruntsfield Hotel, I was indeed, speechless. The decor was so chic and on-trend I was literally flabbergasted. And it's not often I use that word, as I'm sure it's not often you hear it.Getting past the initial shock, the menu selection was great. My first visit was for a brunch (a particularly good time to visit the bistro) and was pleasantly surprised by their contemporary selections. The main meals are good too, not the best but still very good. I had duck and found it a bitty tough, but I didn't mind too much. The surroundings made up for what lacked in the food. Indeed, I felt thoroughly cool sitting there, despite the fact that nobody other than other diners could appreciate it.Definitely worth a visit - Sunday brunch in particular.
