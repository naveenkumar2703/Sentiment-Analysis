5	The crew was great. They gave me a good price and took care of my vehicle in a timely manner.
2	Took way too long for just an oil change. They acted as if bringing in 2 cars (which we had made 2 separate appointments for well in advance, AND arrived ~30 min. early) was a major inconvenience. They kept trying to get us to take one and drive around in it, then come back with the other one after the first was done. LOL? Oh, and the price wasn't too great either, but it was nearby and convenient.The advantage to waiting so long was that we got to try out Black Bear Diner for the first time.
4	I had my brakes done today. They were done right when they said they would be and didn't try to sell me repairs I didn't need.
1	Took my truck in last Saturday for an oil change. Found out the next day that my debit card was charged twice. $81.00 for an oil change. Was told to bring in bank statement as proof of double charge. When I did I was told that it was a bank error and not on their end. It wasn't until I called their corporate office did they confirm that yes I was charged twice for the oil change. So I was lied to by the store manager and now I have to wait 10-14 days to get the $41.00 I'm owed back.
4	Got an oil change here and had an honest experience. The service was fast and they didn't try to push anything on me that I didn't need. I will probably go back for my next oil change.
