4	David has been cutting my hair at his shop in Carefree, for well over ten years. He's a pro; pleasant, meticulous, always reliable. HIGHLY recommended.
5	After staying Carefree for the month of April ,2012 I looked for a barber shop and have to say that this is one I would love to bring home to Boston.Dave gave me two cuts in April, he is just  an excellent barber and very reasonably priced. I usually go to my barber every six weeks or so.But I had to have one to go!!!!!!! Thank You Dave ,and hope to see you next time I am in town. Five stars and two thumbs up, Mark
5	David is a first rate barber!  He and Tanya provide super service and fantastic cuts!  Getting your haircut there is always full of laughter along with a great cut.  I highly recommend you pay Little Barber Shop a haircut.
5	I am new to the Carefree area and wanted to find a good barber. I searched on Yelp and found David at the Little Barber Shop. He is an excellent barber with reasonable rates. Be sure to call ahead as an appointment is usually needed.
5	Coming from the midwest I had a great barber and was concerned whether I would ever find one in North Scottsdale but I did! David does a great job and is reasonably priced. Takes his time with every cut. I'm now a regular customer.
5	David is a great barber, very accommodating with appointments, I've recently moved and have been thru 3 barbers and still can't find anyone as good as david ..david pls move to LA
