3	An OK kinda joint. Was empty when i walked in. Humm... Not necessary a good sign. Alright, screw it i'll do it, its just hair, it'll grow back right? So, i hop in a chair right away and some dude starts hacking away, mostly using a buzzer. Bzzzrr, bzzzrrrr. 20 or so min later i am done. Military style, huh? Not exactly my cup o tea, but what could i expect when i asked for a short haircut?
4	This is a guys place. Sit down and talk about sports. Heck even the owner Tanya can hang in the conversation. Manny is who I go to and either one of them has the fade down to a science. Then you will enjoy a straight razor shave on your neck. This barber shop is reasonable and your cut will be on everytime. no hack jobs here I have been going to this shop for more than 5 years. Excellent
4	This is a wonderful barbershop with great prices . It's staffed with only two barbers who've been in the business for nearly 20 years. They have an extensive and loyal customer base and are on a first name basis with all their regulars, gives it that neighborhood feel that you don't get at the chain cutters or over priced mega salons. I've been a customer since the early '90s and always look forward to chewing the fat with the other regulars. Watch out what you say about the Dallas Cowboys, the owner is a huge fan.
5	My boyfriend gets his haircut here and so I am writing the review for him.  He went back to this place after a few years of being gone and he had forgotten how great this place is.  He said he wouldn't go anywhere else again.  Highly recommend!
