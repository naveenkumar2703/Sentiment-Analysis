2	BEWARE! This place adds 15% tip WITHOUT telling you! So for the late night gamblers high on drinks, they are very much likely to add their own 15% tip in the "tip" line!! Unless they were like me, after leaving tip, went back to check the bill and found out the waiter already sneaked in the tip, yet still left the "tip" line empty for you to add and sign!And i would left double tip had i been serviced well... BUT at this place you had to get up and get your own side dish! Yup, i wouldnt even want to leave 15% if i serviced myself half of the time!Food was okay, there were two flies flying around in the restaurant.. Burger King is cleaner.
1	My family and I went to this restaurant today. There were bunch of traveler from travel agency. They didn't even to come to our table even after pushing call button 5 times. Meat wasn't good as it was before. Not going back again.
5	Though I didn't care for her cooking our food for us, and we're not accustomed to korean bbq being so very expensive ($30+/ person for the seafood inclusive ayce option), this place was great!  Very loud, there was some kind of party/karaoke thing going on.  There is a bar where you go and get all your little banchan, there were several things to choose from, all of the banchan were good thankfully.  I recommend springing for the seafood inclusive option mostly because it is delicious lol.  The shrimp are big and plump, you get butter which makes the already delicious salmon smooth and yummy - the meats were delicious, i think they even had ribeye!  Which I havent always gotten when eating ayce korean bbq.  I can't wait to eat here again next time we're in town, it was a really welcome change from
