2	I was really unhappy with the customer service here. I was trying to exchange something, and it took 10 minutes. The guy took two phone calls while he was working on my exchange. He wandered off to look for a part for someone who was on the phone. Then he started pricing hoses for another caller. He only got serious about helping me when I said, "If you can't finish this transaction in the next two minutes, I would like to return these for a refund immediately." He was done in 45 seconds. Rule of customer service - pay attention to the person standing in front of you.
2	Generally love me some O'Reilly, but I have to agree with Sarah...This store is sooooooooooooooooo slow. There's usually only one person working, and whomever is working will *always* drop *everything* to answer the phone. WTF? Why do phone calls take complete precedence over someone who's in the store?! To make matters worse, they usually are out of whatever type of filter or part I'm looking for, which means I have to run to another store.Done with this place.
5	I experienced great customer service on my first visit.  I simply needed wiper blades and the employee quickly looked up my car model, got my blades for me from the isle, and quickly checked out. On top of that,  the employee offered to walk with me to my car in the parking lot and replace the wipers for me. Within minutes, I had my new blades purchased and installed. Quick and easy! Compared to the other reviews that mentioned slow service, I may have picked the right time to go because it wasn't very busy. Would they have offered to change my blades if it was busy?  Maybe not... but if I had to rate my only experience with them,  they definitely went beyond my expectations.
