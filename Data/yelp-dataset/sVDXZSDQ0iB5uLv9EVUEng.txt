4	I visit this nail salon whenever I have have extra money to go out with my girlfriends. The technicians are always very friendly and able to accommodate us. In fact, one night they stayed past closing to do our appointments last minute!
5	I have been coming to this nail salon for six years now. I've tried many other places and they just don't compare. Very laid back atmosphere, friendly staff and unbeatable prices. This is a family owned spot so if you're more into the chain type places this probably isn't for you. As for me, I wouldn't go anywhere else (:
2	Went here yesterday because of the good reviews and I must admit I am very disappointed. I don't know if it was a miscommunication or what but I wanted the gel nails and I did get acrylic but whatever I let that go. Then she then the gel topcoat I asked her to put on my nails are all bumpy. I pointed it out before I left and she had me put my hands in the uv light thing again and they are even worse. I think only one nail is smooth like it is supposed to be. And also i am pretty sure my thump nail is a little crooked but I am done complaining.I won't ever be back here again.
