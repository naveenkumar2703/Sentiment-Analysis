4	We have used LMP a few times and have always received reasonable bids and good quality work.  I've had them remove a Mesquite tree, remove shrubs and trim other shrubs, and trim all the front yard shrubs at my new home.  They are not punctual and have come later than the scheduled time on each of three visits, but for their reasonable price and good quality work, I can deal with the wait.
1	I am not sure why this company does not seem to want my business.  I first requested online for an estimate.  Was contacted almost immediately and scheduled an estimate within a couple of days.  The gentleman who came out was great.  Very knowledgeable and I was feeling good--finally maybe a lawn service would do what they say and show up!  Well, he made a pretty big deal about staying on a 4 week schedule, which was OK with me. They arrived as scheduled and did my initial work.  This, of course, was at a higher price than the regular monthly maintenance will be.  They did a pretty good job, although did not do some things that I had requested.  They came back and corrected those.  I was told that I would receive an email when my 4 week visit would occur.  5 or 6 weeks later I called and, of course, had to leave a message.  When they called back, I was told that I was never placed on a "maintenance" schedule.  So, I asked to please be put on one.  I was told that they could not come until the following week since that is when they are in this neighborhood.  I got a recorded confirmation call on the next Tuesday saying they would be here on Wednesday--they give you a time frame--you can call morning of to see where you fall on the schedule.  I called and left a message asking when they might arrive.  No return call and they never showed up!  Sent an email--no response.SO, I will need to try and find someone else--they are all unreliable it seems--and probably pay another "initial fee".  I can not recommend this company.
