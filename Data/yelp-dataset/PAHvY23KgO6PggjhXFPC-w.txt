1	I generally try to avoid this location, mostly late at night.  It seems like there are always hoodlums hanging around outside, and the store itself is run down and old.  I've heard that Circle K plans to replace this building soon, which is an excellent idea.  But when the QT opens across the street, I will likely try to go there instead anyhow.  I wonder if others will do the same, and thus help speed up the decision to demolish and rebuild.
1	I for one have a general dislike for ALL circle K's! Everyone I have ever been to including this one has been filthy, with people full of tattoos and piercings and bandaids covering up their hickeys working there.I have nothing against tattoos or piercings but , come on you are working cover that up! It always takes forever and their customer service sucks! Circle K you need to make some major changes if you want your company not to be overrun by the more customer oriented convenience stores!
2	Card reader at the pump doesn't work to well.  Plus they have only 4 pumps. Dont stop if you are in a rush to get gas because you need cash and time.
