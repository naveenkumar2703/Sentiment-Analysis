2	Used a mail-in coupon for smog check because this location offered free car wash with purchase. However, this location sent you to another one to get your free car wash. Inconvenient. I could've just went to that one! Good points: it was fast, no line, and they accept competitor's coupons for $14.99 smog. With car wash $18.99.
4	I have seen this little drive-thru go through a couple different businesses.. hot dog shop, coffee shop.. And It seems like Jiffy Smog has lasted the longest so far..Fast, convenient and cheap.. It took me 15 minutes to be in and out of there and that's with a customer in front of me too.. It's $19.99 for a smog check and they give you a free car wash too.. which is great because that's actually the car wash I go to when I need a quick wash.. It's at the Shells on Durango near Rhodes Ranch.. You can also price match if you bring in a coupon from another business.. can go all the way down to $14.99 I believe.. but if you do that you don't get a free car wash.. I also love the fact that they will renew your registration for you at the DMV for $10... which really isn't that much because I think if you, yourself, go to the kiosk at the DMV they charge you a service charge.. The guy who helped me was very friendly and seemed to know a lot about cars ...TIP: don't forget to tip LOL
5	It's time. SMOG CHECK. This spot is in the parking lot near Hunnie Bunnie's dance school so why the hell not! Plus the Flamingo DMV is nearby too and apparently that DMV location isn't as bad as all the other ones. Anyway, I pull up, dude comes out. He checks a few things and hands me my receipt. I'm good to go.
5	$20 smog check with free drive in car wash. Cant go wrong.  Dmv services. Super friendly staff. Getting my truck washed as I write this review. Dmv down the road.  In and out within 5 min
