4	This is a small Smart & Final location. The employees are always very helpful and nice.I come here because this is the only place that I've found that sells Crystal Geyser Sparkling Mineral Water in a variety pack. It was on sale this week for $13.79 which includes 28 - 18 oz bottles. 8 Lime, 8 Lemon, 8 Orange, and 4 Very Berry
3	I've driven by this store a couple dozen times before stopping in and I have to say I was impressed; great selection of food and household goods; wasn't expecting to much as they are crammed into a small strip mall and parking is very limited but I still walked out with two full grocery carts (glad my bank was right next store so I could grab some more cash) The store was laid out nice, it was bright and items were easy to see and read the expiration dates/etc; I've said this before and I will say it again never come to one of these stores without a list and stick to it or you will end up with two carts full of groceries of stuff you don't need at the time but will eventually get around to using/eating.
3	S&F specializes in bulk food. If you like things like a giant sack of frozen chicken wings, then get your tush down to S&F. Most of the products are cheap or off brands, but there is also stuff like Pierre water (in bulk) and the like. Some of their prices on booze cannot be beat. They have some produce, but it is not of the highest quality, and I would only get it in a pinch. The store is clean and the staff is friendly. But be prepared to wait in line a little while as the person in front of you buys enough food for a small army.
