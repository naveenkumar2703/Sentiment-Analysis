5	Had the lunch special (fish, shrimp, hush puppies, sides).  Fried catfish was finely breaded, tasty and not too greasy.  Macaroni salad and coleslaw definitely homemade with a nice light flavor and texture, a good balance to the fried meal.  Loved the hole-in-the-wall, family-run feel.
5	Lunch specials for $5.95! 3pc fish, 3pc shrimp, 2 hush puppies AND 2 side orders.This all seafood restaurant is my pescetarian dream come true. They offer snapper, catfish, tilapia, trout, buffalo, whiting shrimp, and even oysters. Great food at great prices.Not open Sundays.
5	They also have Gumbo! and Po'Boys! The number to this place is 602-268-7022...call in order is the way to go because no wait!Address is: 1638 E Southern Ave., Phoenix, AZ
2	Okay lunch special.   Get what you pay for.  Too much breading, hush puppies were a bit tiny, salads were soso
