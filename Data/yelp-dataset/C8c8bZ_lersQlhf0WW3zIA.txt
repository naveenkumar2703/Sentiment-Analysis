5	Very professional and best prices in town. You will never meet anyone with more compassion for animals than Andrea. Honest, trustworthy and worry free pet sitting. I would never use anyone else and my pets agree!
5	Would absolutely recommend Andrea's Quality Pet Care. She takes wonderful care of the animals in her charge. Very reasonable prices also.
5	We have 2 Mutts. One is 16 years old and the other is a crazy emotional dog. Andrea's Quality Pet Care provides the kind of personal service and love that really makes it possible to leave our "pups" without worrying that they will get their meds and be safe. Thank you Andrea for a super service at a great price!!!
