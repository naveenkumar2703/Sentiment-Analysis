5	Very expensive, but also very romantic for those "special nights".Food is great, everything is fondue (if you couldn't guess by the name)Friendly staff, very attentive.
5	This is a wonderful location for a romantic evening with your special someone.  My wife and I love to go to The Melting Pot, but it is not something you can do all that often, unless you are rolling in cash.  But, you are getting great fondue and wonderful ambiance for the price, so don't let a little expense steer you away.I remember one year, for my wedding anniversary, I took my wife to The Melting Pot for dinner, then surprised her with a night in a suite at the hotel we spent our wedding night.  It was very romantic.  We even got one of the cool booths that has a privacy curtain.But, you don't just have to go for romance - take some friends and just go for cheese and chocolate!  That is a bit more reasonable, and absolutely, sinfully delicious.The beef, chicken and fish are all top quality cuts, and the vegetables and fruits are bright and delicious - at the peak of ripeness.I cannot recommend this place enough.  Remember, you are going to drop some dough, but you aren't going to care once you eat the food.You go now!!
5	When I get the privilege of "dinner anywhere I want" from the hubby, this Melting Pot is at the top of my list!  Sophisticated, intimate, romantic atmosphere and attentive staff.  The cheese and chocolate fondues are delicious and the "dippables" are of the highest quality.  The whole experience is decadent and worth every penny.  And yes, bring lots and lots of pennies.  It's expensive.
5	Choc-a-holics Unite!!  (Always wanted to say that, hee-hee!)But seriously, if you love chocolate like I do, then the Melting Pot is perfect For you!MP is famous for it's fondue style dinners but for me the star of the show is their desserts! Give me melted chocolate and strawberries and it's ALL GOOD! No seriously....this is my numero uno place for dessert! But I'll get back to that in a moment...Dinner there is more like an experience...first and foremost it will take you at least an hour and a half (depending upon when and what time you go) to get through a typical 4 course dinner (cheese fondue appetizer, salad, main course fondue and of course, dessert). You don't have to have 4 courses but if you're looking to be full going for the full courses will take care of that! (I recommend the fiesta cheese fondue that is custom blended at your table for the appetizer...it's served with blocks of light and dark breads, chucks of cauliflower and carrots and apple slices, YUM!) The main course is chunks of your choice of meats and fish accompanied by several different dipping sauces to try after they are cooked according to your likeness in either hot broth or oil (again your choice of cooking styles)NOW ON TO DESSERT!My fav has got to be the Flaming Turtle..Sounds a Lil suspect I know...but trust me it is fabulous! It's basically milk chocolate, caramel, pecans and a shot of 151 (don't worry its more for show and gets burned off as they light it into the mixture) all melted together to form a little pot of melty chocolate heaven! With this you get strawberries, bananas, pineapples, crushed coconut and Oreo covered marshmallows, chewy fudge brownie bites, and even a Lil slice of cheesecake to dip into your chocolate creation! MY OH MY...every time I get to this part I feel like I'm having an org......OK never mind....let's just say it's over the top DELISH!  ;)My only caveat here at this location is the service is hit or miss... granted the servers here have a lot on their plates and probably do much more than the average but I'm sure the tips are making up for this....my last visit a few weeks ago with my hubs for our anniversary was a perfect example...GREAT food...service (and they knew we were celebrating something) was under par (dude was from like Jersey /NY/Boston or something and had that "ttude..). The hostesses here need an attitude adjustment...all of them...so don't get too put off by them before you get to sit down and experience the fondue....I would give this plae a 4 star because of the bad attitudes that come out of the hostesses on a consistant basis but the dessert is so good it trumps them!TIP: Call and make a reservation in advance and request a booth with the curtains...it's a little more private and makes you feel like your a Lil more exclusive!  ;D
2	Great place for a date or small group but the food and service is a bit overrated! Its also pricey for what you get. I think I paid about $120 for a table of 3 the last time there.
2	What a sub-par dining experience! I bought my husband a $100 gift card to the Melting Pot for his last birthday; we love fondue and make it frequently at home, but it's always a lot of work, and I thought it would be fun to sit back and let someone else stir the pot, if you will. Well, 2 valuable Friday-night hours and $150 (including the gift card) later, I wished we had stayed at home and created shredded mountains of Gruyere and Fontina ourselves. We selected the "Perfect Night Out" (ha!) menu, which allowed you to choose a cheese fondue, a salad, types of meat, style of broth fondue (for cooking the meat) and a dessert fondue. We both had dirty martinis with Absolut, which were $8.50 - so overpriced. We could have gotten Gray Goose martinis for that price elsewhere. Anyway, the cheese fondue fixings arrived, and our server (who was really, really nice and pretty much the only good thing about our dining experience) threw them all in the pot, gave them a quick stir, and Voila!, the worst fondue ever was born. It tasted like melted cheddar, and that's it! There was no complexity or richness at all. The bread cubes for dipping were stale, the mixed veggies just contained cauliflower and baby carrots. The Granny Smith apples were decent, but we finished the first course totally unimpressed (and already staring at our watches!). Next up were the salads. They may have been the worst salads we've ever had. The mushroom spinach salad was drenched in jaw-numbingly sweet dressing, and the Caesar salad dressing was sweet too (?!).  At this point, the meat course arrived, and our server mixed up the "Coq Au Vin" broth (this was an $8 upgrade from the regular bouillon broth), dumping an entire carafe of burgundy wine into the fondue pot. After we began eating this course, my husband correctly pointed out that that was wine we could have drunk instead of sending to a flavorless fate in that pot, and I wholeheartedly agree. The meat was either really overseasoned or underseasoned - as an example, the sirloin cubes were coated in stale, dry herbs, but the chicken, which was supposed to have a vanilla essence, tasted just like dr y chicken. To be fair, the shrimp and lobster tail were decent, but I would have rather gone to Red Lobster and had a lifetime supply of shrimp and lobster tail for much less than we paid for this meal. The dipping sauces that came with this course were also confusing - there were like 8 of them, and except for the melted herb butter, they all tasted totally unappealing. The teriyaki glaze and sweet and sour were the worst - they reminded me of sauces that come on a Yoshinoya rice bowl. Whew, ok, so at this point, we were ready to just get the check and leave before dessert. I am glad that we decided to stick around, since the dessert was the only good part of the meal. We ordered the dark chocolate and Disaronno Amaretto fondue, and we really enjoyed the bananas, rice krispie treats, and strawberries coated with the perfectly melted sauce. The coated marshmellows were strange, though, and we left them on the plate. Based on the taste, quality, and value of this food, I wanted to give this place one star. The incredibly attentive service (don't kill the messenger or, in this case, the deliverer, right?) and dessert made me throw a star back on. If you have $150 to blow, you could have a great meal at Durant's or Elements (or a FEAST at tons of other places); why spend it on an over-hyped and flavorless Melting Pot dinner?
5	OkI hate doing thisI really wish I didn't love a chain fondue restaurant more than the independant fondue places in AZ...But Melting Pot does fondue very well.  Better than the other fondue options.I'm not a fan of their cheeseHowever, their Yin Yang chocolate fondue is SO FREAKING GOODSo yeah.Darn.  I love the Melting Pot.
5	Paul Fratella (General Manager of Melting Pot) knows the meaning of extraordinary customer care.  I took today off from work to take my daughter, who had always wanted try fondue, to Shabu Fondue (they are the closest to our home).  Their website said they were open as of 11 a.m. M-F.  My daughter was so disappointed when we arrived to see that they were closed.  My heart sank.  I called The Melting Pot in Ahwatukee & Paul stated they didn't open until 5 p.m.  We had to pick up my other daughter by 5:30 p.m.  We were so bummed that our special fondue day wasn't going to happen.  Paul sensed the disappointment in my voice and kindly offered to open his doors for us to enjoy lunch.  I was shocked.  My daughter looked as though we had won free tickets to Disneyland.  The rest of the experience just got better & better.  Paul, the General Manager, served us and made us feel special.  It was thrilling to see a big smile on my daughter's face.  Paul transformed our dismal day into a dynamic one.  The food was delicious (fresh, flavorful and filling) and the variety was incredible.  To top it off, they took a picture of us & framed it in a Melting Pot silver frame.  We were impressed and WILL be back!
5	I wish that I could give The Melting Pot more than 5 stars because they made our company holiday party stress free and absolutely perfect!!I have put together a number of company parties and they are always stressful and something horrific normally goes on. Tracy (rest manager) made the entire process a breeze, from start to finish. She even let me taste test the wines we were serving. That was a fun afternoon ;-)The food was amazing, as usual, and the service was outstanding. I would highly recommend the spinach artichoke cheese fondue and the yin and yang chocolate fondue! Amazing!!!!I would highly recommend The Melting Pot to anyone looking to host a holiday party or really any type of party for that matter. It is also a really intimate and romantic place to take someone on a date.
4	WOW!  This place is kind of expensive, but it is good food, great atmosphere and just plain fun.  We went there for my g/f's bday and we had a blast.  The sauces that they give you when you start eating your meats and veggies are sooooo good.  The drinks were not that expensive from what I could tell...I paid $5 for a beer...which is not too bad.  So if you want to go somewhere for a special occasion, then you can't go wrong here.  Just remember to figure, it'll be about $100 per couple...
3	I love fondue.  I love sitting in the private booths with curtains.  I love the idea of dining in privacy.  The Melting Pot also has a nice program called "club fondue" that gives you coupons for a free dessert on your birthday/anniversary.  They have seasonal selections/specialities that can be exciting to try.  But damn if that "I'm too cool for this job" waiter didn't let me down on the service.  It's standard etiquette to knock before opening the curtains and then shut them when leaving.  But the waiter wasn't really interested in doing either.  And then, I promise you, when it came time for the dessert, he didn't bother to stir/mix the ingredients for the chocolate fondue.  Can you actually forget to do that??Still, I love the fondue.
5	The Melting Pot is a great place to eat for special occasions.  The food was really good and the dessert at the end was probably the best part of eating there.  Now before you go you have to look at the menu (it's on their website) to see the prices and what you are getting into.  After you accept the prices sit back, relax, and have fun.  I went there with my wife for our anniversary and it was the perfect place to celebrate.  The atmosphere is very fun and different.  I would definitely anyone who is going for a special occasion to at the very least try it.  You would have a difficult time not having fun.  Anyone who is going here HAS to get the dessert.  If you miss the dessert then you missed the best part!Tips:  Sign up for their "Club Fondue" on their website and you will receive a free dessert for 2 (I believe it's like $16 normally).  They also say they will send you free stuff for birthdays and anniversaries, but I haven't confirmed this.  Also the 3 and 4 course meals (for 2) are a LOT of food.  There was no way we could eat it all, so don't feel like you have to finish everything that comes out and whatever you do, save room for dessert!In summary, great place once you get over the cost, ideal of special occasions, and get the dessert (I swear it's the last time I will say that :) ).
5	Ok, it is probably very rare that I will be handing out 5 stars that much because I'm just like that but this place really deserves it!!!!! Can I say heeelllllllloooooo heaven!!! I might have to say this is the first time I cleaned my plate (and pot). This place has just the right atmosphere for a good night out. The food was excellent and so was our waiter! I would be in trouble if they ever put one closer to me!!! Some people may say that their portions are too small but I have to differ, I never go home hungry and I never leave with that gut wrenching feeling of over eating!!!!I would take out a second mortgage and eat here every night!!!!
3	After my first trip to the Melting Pot, I was in awe over the experience. We started out with a cheese appetizer (which I wasn't in love with), then went for 2 different appetizers, and then the amazing chocolate dessert. The entrees were delicious, but for the small amount of meat actually served, it is extremely overpriced. But, the atmosphere is actually worth the money. The whole restaurant is quiet, perfect for a night of conversation. And, back to the dessert. Melted chocolate fondue with all sorts of yummy treats to dip: fruits, cheesecake, marshmallows, brownies, etc, etc. Mmmmmm! Just the dessert, quiet atmosphere, and the bottle of wine had me sold on the evening. But, like all others have said, it is very pricey. It was about $140 for 2 of us; including a bottle of wine, an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert plate.
2	The food is good and it's a different experience. That experience wasn't worth the price, though.Service was incredibly slow - 3 hours for 6 people and we didn't even do dessert. A "glass" of wine is about half of what would be considered a full glass anywhere else.  They add a gratuity of 20% to tables of 5 or more so I guess our server knew she was getting paid no matter what.I can spend $80 a person and get much better service and food that I don't have to cook elsewhere.
3	Try the Love Martini. It is fantastic!Three starts because it is super pricey. The waitress also thought I was strange because I asked her to not add the mushrooms to the fondue pot. Also, we had a bit of a disagreement when I said we did not have one in North Dakota. She insisted that we did, only to be proven wrong at desert.Good place for a romantic date, but next time I am going to look for a small less chain like place to eat.
4	I like this location better than the one in Scottsdale, I think the staff is way friendlier. I don't really think it's worth eating actual dinner here, in my eyes it's only good for cheese and chocolate courses. BUT do be sure to sign up for their mailing list, I have gotten some AWESOME deals.
5	Pure Bliss - I haven't had a quality meal experience like this in a very very long time.  The full 4 course dinner was stupendous and well worth every cent. You MUST try the Yin & Yang Martini!  It was  a very creative and well presented drink  that had me all smiles.  I had the Smores & Chocolate desert and it was hands down my favorite (I've tried at least 5 others).
4	This is such a fun date restaurant. They have booths with curtains so you can...feed each other!!! They even knock before they open the curtains! Yes - it is expensive, but you are paying for the experience! I highly recommend the Caribbean cheese fondue - it was not an intuitive choice, but was very delicious. Strawberries in dark chocolate fondue is also wonderful. I went here for a girls night out once, and had a ton of fun. On that evening, we were not behind curtains, but in a long dining area with other ladies doing the same thing. One note - the cocktails are extremely sweet - so you may want to stick to wine.
2	I frankly don't get why people like this place....with exception of desert, - fruit, cake, dipped in chocolate - ok, I get it...its good and I would go back for that and that alone.But for dinner...way overpriced, way overrated. Not family friendly at all. There are much better options out there in terms of value and quality.
4	I went to happy hour this evening with two girlfriends. This may be one of the best happy hours in Ahwatukee. $3 Beer, $5 Wine & $6 Cocktails  +  fondue and appetizer specials. We had the wisconson trio, a yummy blue cheese fontina concoction, which was served with  bread, apples and vegies.  For dessert,  we shared the dark chocolate fondue w/ extra strawberries. It was delish!  The only thing that would have made this better was if the bar was packed. We were the only peeps there.  I hope the happy hour word spreads because happy hour is best in large groups of happy people.
4	I've been here before and normally I think they're really overpriced.  I mean really.  Cheese and chocolate doesn't cost THAT much but they just started a happy hour I went to with Ada G. and another friend and for that their prices are great.  $4 fondue and $6 cocktails.  All of their cocktails are overly sweet and their house wines are on the cheap side, but you get what you pay for.  Nothing's bad, just not great.  The fondue on the other hand is great.  We coerced Ada G. into the dark chocolate and ordered it with extra strawberries.  Heavenly.  We joked we'd be back every Tuesday after we picked up our CSA veggies.  Maybe we weren't joking?
4	Hmm.. I am surprised at the amount of 2 stars with fellow reviewers. Seems sketchy to me.Here is the deal with Good Fondue:Not for a family. Yeah, its a romantic type place. Take a date. Or your wife for gods sake. (She likes to go out too!)Expensive: Yes, in this day and age, good food can still be expensive. Its worth it people. The time it takes to eat an entire meal here is why it costs so much. You take up 2+ hours of their time for 2 to 4 people to eat. They just can't turn tables like your everyday meal type restaurant.These meals are meant to be savored. Enjoyed with a good glass of wine, or beverage of your choice. Try to relax here. Enjoy the food, and company most importantly. The menu changes a bit from time to time to include a new set of dishes, guessing every 6-8 months. I miss the salad that had heart of palm in it! It was fantastic.There is enough variety to actually satisfy 2 different peoples desires in most of their entrees.Desert, as noted by most everyone on here, is to die for. I have not had one bad desert yet.The quick and easy guide to The Melting Pot: Coq au Vin is the baseline cooking that most will love. Traditional Swiss cheese is where "IT" is at. Featured salad is usually a good bet. California salad is a good standby. Deserts: Try them ALL! Seriously...
4	My wife and I have been talking about returning here for quite some time, and finally decided to make good on it. I was a bit wary of the price because it's clearly one of the most expensive places around. I had a coupon from one of those infamous "Entertainment" books, but that didn't soften the blow much.We made a reservation, which they "strongly recommend", but showed up 20 min early and they were happy to accommodate us. The place was nearly deserted at 4:45pm on a Saturday, although it was Labor Day weekend when people are out of town.Our coupon was good for the "Big Feast" even though I had doubts about being able to stomach the dessert after eating cheese fondue, salad, and a main course. We got the Swiss cheese fondue, which was excellent. Next, the caprese salad, which is very light and refreshing after all that cheese (however, it contains even more cheese), and then the main source which is basically a bunch of raw meats on a platter that you cook with your choice of liquids. We went with the coq a vin or whatever it is, and the basic set of meats because we don't like lobster enough to pay extra for its inclusion. Everything seemed fresh and the sauces they provide are good. Nothing that really hits it out of the park, but good. For dessert, we had the chocolate with marshmallows, which was mainly in deference to my wife because I despise marshmallows.At some point, the manager came around to ask if everything was okay. I always enjoy this interaction at restaurants, as it indicates the manager is actually interested in the quality of service and food. Everything was good, and we left full and happy. They could work on those sauces and make the main course something that really pops -- as it stands, it seems like the cheese and dessert fondues are more the highlights of the meal.
2	If I have to review the food alone, I will give it a one star.  The service is prompt and courteous so I'll give it an extra one star.Let's start from the beginning.  We had a reservation and was seated promptly.  The waiter came and greeted us, gave us the menu and everything went well.Appetizer: We started with the Alp & Dell Cheese Fondue which is a white wine and Gruyere, Raclette and Fontina Cheese Fondue. It tasted two dimensional, exactly garlicky and salty.  The raw cauliflower and carrot which I usually love to eat tasted bitter with the cheese.Salad: We went with California Salad which is mixed salad greens with raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  The salad came very watery, very very sweet and it was swimming in the dressing. We could not even finish it off.Main Course: This is the worse of all the courses. We picked the pacific rim cooked in coq au vin broth.  It came with Teriyaki Marinated Sirloin, Citrus Pork Tenderloin, Shrimp, Chicken, Pot sticker, Mushroom, and Veggies.  We deliberately chose coq au vin broth even though it cost more because we read here that it's worth it. Everything tasted bland and that citrus pork and teriyaki sirloin tasted very weird, sour and salty and not in a good way at all.  The chicken and the shrimp also tasted bland.  It really tasted like boiled chicken meat that's a bit salty. Their solution?  Dip it in our sauce: Teriyaki, Sweet and Sour and Yogurt based curry sauce.  The sauces tasted like cheap sauces you can find in a bottle in any grocery stores. It has no character, no complexities,  very very disappointing.  Oh yeah, this is what our waitress said,  just cook everything about 2 minutes or so, don't worry if you don't time it correctly, it's impossible to overcook anything here, just leave it on the pot and that's fine.  This is not just the cooking instruction for  our table.  We can hear that every table get the same cooking instructions from different waiter/waitress.  The problem is not overcooking for us, but it just tasted bland.Dessert: We chose the Smore with Dark Chocolate Fondue.  This is the best part out of this horrible feast.  It comes with Strawberry, Graham Cracker, Marshmallow, Cheesecake, Pound Cake and Rice Crispies to dip it with. First, the strawberry was fresh, marshmallow was great, graham cracker was crunchy.  Now come the bad part, the part that they had to make: The rice crispies was kinda stale, the pound cake was crumbling like a week old cake, and the cheesecake was just meh.  We suddenly realized that the part that was good, they did not have to make( ie: the strawberry, the cracker and the marshmallow).  The part that they had to make tasted bad( ie: the crispies, cheesecake, pound cake).  We do not mind splurging on our foods on special occasion.  We realize that it takes a lot of efforts to make special dishes.  This is seriously lacking in everything, cheap basic material for the food, horrible taste, and no cooking method involve at all by the kitchen.  Why are we paying that much again?  I don't mind paying $100 for a meal if it is cooked properly and tastes great.  It's not the price at all, it's just there is no value to this meal.
4	The melting pot is always a great place to go with a date, it is nice because the dinner is an experience, and the staff is in no hurry to get you moving so they can fit another table in. I have to knock down a star because they took away the quattro formaggio cheese (the reason I went to this place as often as I did). The spinach and artichoke is pretty good, and the desert is always amazing. I have always enjoyed every server we have had at the melting pot, they are so nice and really knowledgable on all of the food. It is a little pricey sure but well worth it if you need a comfort food fix.
1	For my first visit to The Melting Pot, I decided to go on my birthday with my husband, my parents and his parents.We were sat in a back room all by ourselves. Literally we could have heard a pin drop. Normally, I would have LOVED this ... However it must have been a package deal: get your own room, get crappy service.Granted, I didn't expect to be in and out of the place within an hour, but I also didn't expect it to take three and a half hours either! Our server was SO slow. We normally NEVER have a lack of dinner conversation, however we found ourselves twiddling our thumbs just waiting for our server several times.The food, however, was delicious. But NOT worth the prices they charge.Unfortunately, this was my first and last visit to The Melting Pot.
3	Valentine's Day 2010...time for a romantic dinner with my husband and since I'd never been to Melting Pot before, he thought it was the perfect day to go. The first thing I noticed when we were walking up was the balloon arch and red carpet (taped to the ground with red duct tape!). While I appreciated the effort, it came across cheesy (and cheap) for a restaurant that I presume to be higher class than the average. Once inside, we saw how incredibly dim the lights were. Almost like a cave! I love mood lighting, but it was way too dark to be romantic...it felt more like bed-time than sexy-time, lol.Once we were seated our server introduced herself and was informative about the menu & how the meal would progress/cook/etc. Maybe she wasn't as friendly as we would have liked, but that wasn't a deal breaker. I've had chocolate fondue before, but have never experienced a full-course meal. We went with the swiss cheese starter. Great flavor, but the garlic over-powered the fondue. I did enjoy trying out the taste of the apples, grapes, and tiny pickles in it (along with the bread) though. Next, we chose salads...I went with the California while my husband had the Chef's. My salad was so flavorful and tasty! I really liked the sweet and vinegar combination. Hubby said his salad was "ok". Following the salads, we selected the meat entree over the seafood. Our cooking style was the boullion broth. It came with chicken, two types of beef, shrimp, and ravioli. With the exception of one of the beef choices, they were all delicious. They even came with several sauce and veggie options. For dessert, we decided on the basic milk chocolate fondue. The strawberries, pineapple, brownie bites, cheesecake bites, and pirouettes were a perfect way to end the meal, although the two marshmellow choices were too sugary to enjoy. Even though all the portion sizes were small, we were so stuffed that we couldn't finish our meat and dessert courses.We really appreciated our server offering sparkling apple cider for our complimentary V-Day toast instead of champagne. When the check came, it was over $200 and we were surprised to see an automatic 18% gratuity added on (and then there was a space for an additional tip too). My husband has always been an awesome tipper, so that was a sour note in an otherwise sweet dinner. A cute touch to the holiday was that an employee came by during dinner, took our picture, and put it in a frame and then we picked it up on the way out. Overall, it was a romantic and delightful meal, but if we ever go back again it will only be for a special once a year dinner or just for dessert.
4	We went for happy hour yesterday after reading some reviews.  With only 15 seats for happy hour, we thought we'd have to get there early, but NO ONE WAS THERE.  The bar tender said it RARELY fills up!  Shocker!  With good drink deals ($5 martinis, $6 wines, and good beer deals) as well as $4 fondue for cheese or chocolate, this really is a great first date place.  yes, the date would have to be early, but you could easily catch a movie afterward
4	We stopped in for dessert only.  We arrived right at 4:00pm, opening, and were greeted with a very friendly smile and seated quickly.  Jeremy was our server and he was great! We had the Chocolate Turtle Flambe.  Of course the kids loved the fondue forks and were amazed at the chocolate on fire!  Then all the fantastic tastes on the dessert plate, strawberries, cheesecake, marshmallows, bananas, pound cake and brownies.  They didn't stand a chance!  Jeremy brought us out extra bananas, pound cake and marshmallows.We had a great time and will return for a full meal, or just dessert again.
5	I don't "do" girls night out.  But for The Melting Pot, I "did do" girl's night out.  I went with three girls that I cheered with back in high school.  I mean waaaayyyyy back in high school.  How far back?  No business of yours, sir!  Anyhow, after reconnecting after ...let's call it "many" years... the four of us went to TMP for 'couples night'.  We feigned lesbian love in order to fit into a great special, and I'm not afraid to admit it!  No, really, they didn't seem to care, as long as we were in groups of two.  If you read nothing else, read this:  Plan on three + hours here.  Savor.  Enjoy.  Linger.  It takes that long... it just DOES.  Do not tell your spouse (or babysitter or cat or whomever you answer to) that you'll be home in two hours.  Ahem.Onward!Best highlight of the night for me: the Search and Rescue Spoon!!!!!  This struck my funny bone so hard and it was the topic of many jokes and pictures throughout the night.If you are looking for a place to take kids, do the rest of us a favor:  DON'T COME HERE.  Go someplace where the food is served in nugget form, and removal of shoes is appropriate. We don't want to hear your kids whine or your baby scream.  I have kids but there's a time and a place, people.  The rest of us come to places like this just to get away from you.  Moving on!I could wax fond for hours giving loving descriptions of the food here, I really could.  It was both unique AND delicious.  The experience of it is incredibly fun, the atmosphere feels SO intimate somehow (no awkward eye contact with anyone who isn't at your table) and everything about it just amazing.  There was an "appetizer" course, a "main" course, and a "dessert" course.  You can choose to dip or cook your food in any kind of cheese or broth... but let's be honest, it's all foreplay leading up to to what really matters there:  the dessert course.  We chose the "S'mores" dessert experience.  I'm not being pretentious... it really is an *experience*.  Just think:a giant pot of melted chocolate, swirled with marshmallow cream, which gets some sort of flammable (I'm assuming liquor) poured on top and set on fire, which toasts the marshmallow creme, and THEN they add the crushed graham crackers.... and after THAT we got to dip things like cheesecake, rice krispy treats, poundcake, strawberries, and brownies in the hot melty S'morey goodness... let me just say that I briefly experienced Nirvana.Yes, yes, I hear people say it's expensive, and I guess that is relative.  If you've stayed at the Aria, or in a suite at Mandalay Bay, or anywhere decent in Vegas for a week and paid $40 for a drink poolside, then comparatively/relatively....  it was downright cheap.  (If you get all indignant over anything that doesn't come from the dollar menu at McDonalds, then don't go to Vegas and don't go to The Melting Pot.  Seriously, just stay at home and crab about inflation and watch some public television, you'll be happier.)    As for me, the whole point of working is to earn money that then enables me to go places and eat things and buy stuff for my family.  This falls in the category of "going to a Place" and "eating Things" so I was happy.Once we split up the dinner bill, I felt that my portion (including the completely  optional dessert course and one adult beverage- so if you must be a tightwad you could do it for less than I did) of only $40 was downright freaking CHEAP, worth every last cent and then some... and I can't wait to go back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	Look, I had a gift card for $10 and no reason to go to The Melting Pot. So already this wasn't going to be the best experience ever.The two stars I'm giving were for the first time I called to see if they would just do a ceaser salad w/chicken to go. I called around 2, not knowing this was a dinner only restaurant, but the lady I spoke to said she could prepare the salad for me, just not the chicken because the cooks weren't even in yet. She was very nice and I appreciated her willingness to accommodate me HOURS before they even open. But I decided to skip it, not wantging her to go to the trouble when they were closed. On her own, this lady was 4-5 stars,  and I wished I would've just had her make the salad. Ok. Skip ahead a week. Now I'm sick and call about 8 at night to see if I can pick up the salad on my way home from work. I'm told they don't do to go orders. I tell the girl I spoke with someone last week and she said no problem, so this girl puts me on hold to speak w/ a manager. She comes back and says yes to the salad, no to the chicken because they have no way to cook it. So, within 1 week, a restaurant has lost the ability to cook a chicken breast. Really? .... so I ask for a cup of hot tea, since I'm sick. She says "I promise you, there is no way I can give a to go drink". Oh, but I can take a teabag if I really need it.I tell her to forget the whole thing. Way too difficult of a conversation, especially when 1)I'm ill and 2) a week earlier it was no problem. So now I have a giftcard, no salad, and a bad taste in my mouth from the experience
4	Fall in love with fondue at the Melting Pot! The cheese fondue and the dessert fondue are my favorites, but the entrees aren't shabby either! Come hungry and expect to stay several hours. The only reason I gave 4/5 stars is for the price. We are teachers and about go broke dining here, but once in awhile we need to give ourselves a treat and splurge! Atmosphere is great for special occasions.  Cheese fondue favorite = SwissDessert fondue favorite = yin/yang (while & dark chocolate)
4	This is a great place to take your time and enjoy someones company.The food is fresh and the service always friendly.If you are looking to be fed fast this is not the place to go.Fondue is fun!If you have the time and the money this is a place to have a great evening.
4	My boyfriend and I like to come here now just for the dessert.  He's not into paying to cook his own food so the allure of the meal packages doesn't work on him.  But, dessert we will both do, and the Melting Pot is one of our favorite places to do so.I love the variety that you get with the dessert fondue: cheesecake, pound cake, brownies, cream puffs, strawberries, bananas, multiple types of marshmallows, and pineapples are all cut up into mini pieces perfect for feeding each other behind the closed curtain.  We always choose the turtle (chocolate and caramel with pecan nuts), and request the dark chocolate instead of the milk chocolate for those extra antioxidants.  We recently came to the one on Ray Rd for our Anniversary on New Year's and I was especially pleased with the service.  The waiter not only recommended the correct size we would need for the two of us without trying to upsell us and leave us with way too many leftovers, but he also brought us extra pieces of our favorite "bites" when we had finished to make sure we were happy and the extra chocolate didn't go to waste. I really appreciated the great service and the great food, and for that I say Thank You Melting Pot!
4	Visited for the first time last night and it was delicious.  Service was a little slow, but the server was very friendly and knowledgeable. We had the Big Night Out Fondue Fusion, and the Snickers chocolate fondue. We left very full and quite happy.
1	Awful ... This was a terrible experience. The meat was old looking - slimy and grey and the broth or whatever they call it that we were supposed to cook the meat in looked like dirty sea foam and tasted worse. Not to mention the fact that we were left to sit in front of this boiling pot of yuck for more than 20 minutes before I finally went to find our waitress to ask where our food was.... Anyway maybe they were having an off night but both my daughter and I were beyond disappointed. I will never go back.
4	This is one of my favorite splurge restaurants, but this review is for their Happy Hour. I never think of Melting Pot for great Happy Hour deals, but I will now. They offer $5 cheese and chocolate fondues as well as great drink and salad specials. The atmosphere in the bar is romantic and quiet. We were the only people in the bar for our entire visit. The bartender was great and made adjustments to the cheese like we requested without a problem. I think the hh hours are 4-6pm, but don't quote me on that. If you are looking for a different happy hour vibe check out the Melting Pot.
3	I would defintley come back for the desert but the rest of the meal was so-so and definitely overpriced.
1	Worst! Service is good, "food scraps" are too expensive and tasteless.  They also use a bait and switch method in their pricing.  Spend your $100 elsewhere!
5	This is the second time I've been to a Melting Pot restaurant (the first was in Scottsdale, AZ), and this experience was just as wonderful as the first.I love the idea of this restaurant - it's definitely not just a meal, it's a dining experience.  It's my favorite place to go for "date night".  It gives me a good excuse to get dressed up!  Here are a few tips: first of all, you should make reservations in advance, and be sure to request one of the private booths.  They have a little curtain that closes and makes your table really intimate and romantic!  Secondly, do not eat much for lunch - the meals are very filling!  Third, you need to plan on AT LEAST two hours for your meal.  There are usually four courses, and each one takes a while to prepare and eat.  The food is always delicious - each course comes with a wide variety of "dippers", and you get a choice of the types of cheese, chocolate, etc. so that every time you go, it can be a new experience.  I also highly recommend the drinks - the "Yin/Yang Chocolate Martini" is to die for!  This is by far my favorite romantic restaurant.  The only problem is that it is pretty expensive.  Luckily, last week was Arizona Restaurant Week, so the meals were only $30 per person!  (Still pretty expensive, but we went for our 2 year anniversary, so we splurged a bit.)  I would like to look into their Happy Hour specials sometime, since I've heard good things about them. Overall, if you're looking for a relaxing, romantic, unique dining experience, you can't beat The Melting Pot!
5	THE WORLD MUST KNOW ABOUT SHELLEY!As a going away dinner (I'm moving back to the Northwest), a few friends and I went to The Melting Pot. It happened to also be AZ Restaurant week so the usually expensive food was more reasonable. Our first course was a cheese fondue with breads and veggies, our second course was the usual broth to cook meat in, and the third course was a dessert fondue.To start things off, while waiting for a table, the manager manning the register noticed I was checking into Yelp and Foursquare from my phone, and she told me about the QR code they had for a free chocolate fondue for two. I quickly scanned the code, filled the little form out, and was rewarded with extra dessert. Awesome.We met our waitress, we were told she is the best in the world. Her name is Shelley.  To start off with, we were under constant attention as we got situated, got our water, were walked through the menu and how everything works. Shelley seemed like a normal waitress as she brought out our appetizer fondue (the spinach artichoke, delicious). We were able to make small talk. She was approachable. Dinner progressed, and she was always there to help us out, and she would laugh with us at our dumb jokes. Pretty normal stuff.Dessert came around, and both Shelley and the manager were at our table helping us with our dessert decision. As part of AZ Restaurant week, we got 4 dessert portions, the QR promo added another 2. They warned us that 6 portions would be far too many. Without any hesitation, they allowed us to use the QR promo as a coupon instead, which took $16 off our check. They also still allowed us to have two separate 2 serving chocolate fondues (different flavors). It is so nice when a restaurant and its employees work with their customers and don't have some sort of rulebook that they need to stick to.Everything is great so far, but it only gets better.Along with our first dessert fondue (the flaming turtle), she brought back a dessert for me that isn't even on the menu. We had talked about it earlier, and she made it specifically for me just because we talked about it. No extra charge. Now I know this won't happen to everyone who goes to The Melting Pot, but the fact that it happened at all speaks greatly to the restaurant. A waitress was able to make a customer a custom dessert? That's fantastic. So Shelley is already getting a huge tip.We proceed through the flaming turtle and into the second dessert fondue, which was described as a chocolate covered pretzel. It was delicious. Now we get the bill, which we planned on splitting. After drinks, and lobster tails, and such, the bill became a little more complicated than just splitting the bill four ways. I was doing math on the bill when I noticed that the coupon wasn't applied so the bill was 16+tax+gratuity higher than it should have been. I told her about it, she apologized, took the bill and rung up a new and accurate one. Embarrassingly, since it seemed so ridiculous, I asked for the old bill back because it had my math on it. She left the table, and came back a few minutes later with the old bill, now wrinkled. She said, "I'm sorry, I threw it away, but I found it in the trash!" SHE WENT THROUGH THE TRASH FOR MY OLD BILL JUST TO SAVE MY FIRST GRADE ADDITION WORK. Who does this? Superstar waitresses only.At this point, I'm imagining Shelley as some sort of action movie hero. When she leaves our table, she straps on the jetpack to fly to the nearby store just to pick up the ingredients she needs to make my custom dessert, and she's back in time to replace my plate that I accidentally put raw meat on. Then she is off again, wading her way through trash to look for my coveted scratch marks on a bill that truly was garbage. If you ever go to this place, request the action movie hero Shelley as your waitress. Food: 5/5Service: 5/5
3	I really do not get all of the hype.  The overall meal was okay.  Smalll portion and very pricey.  The dessert was pretty good but not worth the overall cost of the bill.  My recommendation is to go for dessert only.
3	The hubby took me here for a date night. The ambiance is great, and it is fun to watch your food cook and coordinate the various meal options with your date. That being said the food is just okay for me. My husband always says it is about the experience and I would tend to agree with him. Next time I think we will just experience the s'mores fondue and skip the rest. Much easier on the pocketbook that way. I do recommend joining Club Fondue as about three times a year we get free chocolate fondue for two which is probably the best part.
5	The food is great as usual. And the service there never disappoints. Jeremy was awesome. Fondue Feast. Lager and Cheddar Cheese fondue. The meats had the advertising Latin spin for the current Big Night Out. The dessert was dark chocolate with sea salt. All was A-OK.The table next to us was inhabited by two of the most annoying groups of diners I've ever experienced. When we arrived, the meal was winding down for a mother, her 13-ish old daughter, and that daughter's friend. If they hadn't been so young, I would have sworn the girls were drunk off their respective asses. They kept screaming across the restaurant for the waiter, thinking they were going to hook him up with their cougar mom. I'm thinking that probably wasn't an option, as I'm pretty sure the waiter didn't play for that team. But hearing yells of  "WE NEED MORE NAPKINS JEREMY" was enough to make want to throw hot bouillon over the wall onto their skank little heads.We had about 15 minutes of quiet after they left, until this weird older couple was seated at the same table. The woman had a ghastly hat that looked like she had shopped at Savers for a hat to wear to the Churchill Downs. It was white with lots of lace and feathers and crap. And she left it on the entire meal. They went on an on with the waiter about how it was their 24th anniversary, we got to hear about restaurants that the husband was "forbidden to go to" because of his flatulence, we were subjected to them listening to Jack Johnson on their phone, and had to hear their incessant nincompoopery while we finished our dessert.Love the Melting Pot, but maybe will go to one in a different area of town next time.
5	Went last night to celebrate my birthday with 6 other friends and family. First of all, I want to apologize to the other patrons that were sitting near us because after 4 of their WONDERFUL chocolate martinis I probably was pretty loud too.I wasn't wearing a hat though. The food was wonderful as always especially since we started with the dessert and went from there. Jeremy also was our server and he couldn't have been more adorable.After  I got my birthday hug I personally don't think he plays on any other team then the girls.:)) The staff made the whole experience even more enjoyable for me. thank you. thank you thank you to the whole Melting Pot crew
5	My boyfriend brought me here for our second year anniversary and it was really amazing! We had a nice private seating area and the service was very polite and educated us on all the foods and how to pair things together over all a very lovely and romantic evening! They even brought us chocolate covered strawberries and wrote happy anniversary on the plate in chocolate. Would recommend for a special evening out (Would also recommend reservations)
4	This trip to the Melting Pot was an adventure into the unknown. Went with my bf, and a friend, for a bday celebration. None of us had ever been to the MP, or any fondue place for that matter. We weren't sure what to expect. It was a Friday night, didn't look too busy, but we still had to wait 30 minutes longer than our reservation for a table.  We chose a four-course meal, and it's amazing how small bites could be so rich and filling. I only took away one star for having to wait for half an hour for our reservation. Otherwise, good food and fun experience to go with friends.
4	Loved this date, the food was pretty much what I anticipated as a fondue fan. I was floored however by their extensive dessert menu, where the flaming turtle using dark chocolate was the highlight of the meal. It will be in the potential date night rotation in the future.
4	Great food, great service!
2	Normally I would give Melting Pot a 5 star but our dinner tonight was just okay.  Our server was slower then normal.  We know to plan a couple of hours for dining at the Melting Pot...and that is one of the reasons we love it but 3 hours was a bit long. I could even live with the three hours but what really got me in the end was the dessert...which if you read the reviews is what they are known for.  After much debate we ordered the Turtle fondue.  After placing the chocolate/caramel  mixture on our table I asked about the pecans...which I was then informed by the server...oh we're out of pecans!  REALLY...that would have been good information when we ordered the Turtle fondue.  Then she charged us $2.00 extra for another cheesecake.  Maybe you should have went ahead and gave us the extra cheesecake since you were out of pecans for our TURTLE chocolate fondue. It wasn't our first rodeo at this establishment.  We go every year for our anniversary...I think next year we will find a new spot.
4	As a member of Club Fondue, I took advantage of their free cheese fondue offer they were running this week. Score! The location that I usually go to in Scottsdale was booked, so I made a reservation for the Phoenix location. I arrived a few minutes before my reservation and the hostess let me know that the table wouldn't quite be available at 7:30, which was fine because my date was running super late. She offered me a seat at the bar but I just hung out and was seated not too long after arriving. The decor of the place is different from the Scottsdale local. A bit more Southwestern and warm in my opinion. I was seated at the booth for about 10 minutes, still waiting for my date, but our server Cory came by and got my drink order and dropped off the menus. Once my date arrived, we decided to get the Big Night Out cheese fondue, which was REALLY good. We skipped over the other courses and got the Big Night Out chocolate fondue, which was dark and milk chocolate, peanut butter, and berries. It was really good. TMP is definitely a special-occasion place in my opinion, unless I'm taking advantage of one of their special offers they have every once in awhile. And it makes an impressive dessert date
2	Overpriced and overhyped food. Last time turned around at the door due to the smell and waiting line.....
1	Feeling generous with the one star today. Food was good but service was lacking. I don't believe that you should have to wait 30-40minutes for water to arrive at your table or watch your appetizer pot steam for that long either.  The bad service outweighed the food this time. Disappointed. Seems like the Melting Pot should read some of these reviews to make improvements.
4	I was not a believer, but one of my friends said I would not be disappointed so I gave it a shot  Happy Hour in the bar is $5 a person per section ($5 cheese, $5 chocolate, $4, salad, and drink specials as well).  I was super surprised, it was all really good of course, and I was FULL!!!  Also, you can have more bread and dessert for free if you have and of your cheesy or chocolatey goodness left!  Took a lot of time, I think we were there for like 2 hours but I would do it again.
3	It was pretty good. Quality of the meat could have been better
5	Went for my friends birthday. You really can't go wrong with Melting Pot. This one stands apart for its service. We had a fantastic time and every single person wished her a happy birthday. It was very sweet. Our water glasses were never below half, and our "dippers" came out with perfect timing. They also made three special plates for us since we had some food allergies in our group. I really think you should try this one just based on service alone. We had Lisa, and she was adorably sweet.
3	I wasnt thrilled with the taste of the food compared to how pricy it is. I would have enjoyed a juicy steak somewhere else. However i do like the romance of fondue
1	Unfortunately I have to downgrade my rating of this restaurant after today's events.I'll preface this review with the recognition that The Melting Pot recommends reservations. However, of the many many times we've visited this location, we've never had a problem getting right in without a reservation owing to the fact that we go at off-times. So we have a long history of going without a reservation, and have always been seated--maybe with a 30 min wait at most, but usually right away.My wife and I walked in at 4:00pm on Sunday (our 12th wedding anniversary) and the parking lot was nearly empty. The hostess gave us the usual "Can I help you?" which I have always found odd, as if there is some other reason I would be there than to eat. We said we didn't have a reservation and she immediately told us we couldn't be accommodated. Apparently they had sold a "living social" and thus the restaurant was just impossibly booked.This was (almost) comical because the place was deader than disco--not even a single human voice could be heard. I happen to know what Living Social is, but what if I didn't? Why is that my concern, and why is that being given as a reason for not seating me? Not "we're all booked up", which I can understand, but apparently they were saving empty tables in case people decide to come in and redeem their Living Social coupons. Shame on me, I guess, for not getting a coupon.To be clear, I have absolutely no problem with being turned away at a restaurant that recommends reservations. That's my fault for ignoring the recommendation. I do have a problem with being turned away at a half-empty restaurant because they did a Living Social deal and thus they can't accommodate me just in case these hypothetical coupon-holders come in the door. If that's how you want to run your business, fine, but don't make it the customer's problem.I've spent thousands here and won't be going back ever again. So, I hope your "Living Social" was worth screwing over your long-term customers.
5	This is a great restaurant for special occasions.  Most recently I went for an anniversary, and the booth with a curtain was very romantic.  We decided to just get salads, and the cheese and dessert courses because those are the best parts!  It's also plenty of food without the meat course.  I love the experience of fondue as well as the variety of flavors.  We paired our meal with a good wine and spent an hour and a half just enjoying ourselves.  Good atmosphere, great food, friendly service... it's not cheap, but (again, for special occasions) the value is worth it.
4	I hadnt been there in years, and it was all I remembered.  I went with a coupon that I go purchased on the Living social website.  Champagne toast, appertizer, salad and all you can eat entree.  They also do a complimentary photo for you.  Very quaint and romantic.  But the food was fantastic.  We had the cheese fondue that was just delicous.  The meat course was also wonderful.  But the thing that really made our experience great, was waiter.  He was great, and funny and he was there when you needed him.But I do not suggest turning up there without a reservation.  You can make reservations online, very quick and easy and you get a confirmation.
5	My boyfrind and I attended here this past weekend on Serptember 8,2012 to celebrate our one year anniversary. Every employee went out o their way to tell us Happy Anniversary. We were seated quickly after entering the restaraunt. Our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly and very professional. We were given our own privacy to celebrate intimately. The food was amazing and we both enjoyed our selves so much!! Thank you Meling Pot. We are going to make you our annual celebration spot!!!
4	Great happy hour specials! They also do a special during the summer when the temp hits a certain point they give free chocolate or cheese fondue to they're facebook fans.
2	My husband and I went to the Ahwatukee establishment using the Living Social voucher. This was our very first visit and it may be our last. Let's just say for the actual price of the food that this restaurant isn't worthy of a revisit. Our waitress was nice but she wasn't attentive and she was quite sloppy. For instance, when taking our menu's away, instead of walking away with them she just places it on the wall divider between us and the adjacent booth. The menus were just lying around there the entire time, never picked up just flopping over into the other booth!!! Our waitress NEVER rounded, we kept on looking for her and another waitress from the table across from us ended up refilling our waters because she was taking forever when rounding. We noticed the waitress across from us was very good to their party, constantly rounding and making sure everybody had their refills and checking in on the food and if they wanted more entrees. Although our entrees were bottomless, we only received two platters because again our waitress took FOREVER to return to our table. By the time we received the second plate of meats our fondue practically ran out of steam and juice!! She also forgot about our champagne, gave us the check and walked away. We had to yet again ask for her because she took 10 hours long, then when she finally came back we explained we didn't receive our champagne and she was just like, "oh ya, i'll be back," didn't even apologized, was all nonchalant about it and we were like "really???" The service, at least from our waitress was ridiculous, we wished we had the other one sitting across from us who refilled our drinks, then maybe our experience would have been better.Lastly, the decor!!!! Seriously for such a "high end" establishment, this place could use lots of remodeling... the decor is very 1990's and needs a make-up STAT!We will give em props on the food, because it was DELICIOUS!! The salad wasn't a big deal, but the appetizers were AMAZING, same with the entrees, the meats were tender and succulent!! But alas, the lack of customer service from our waitress killed it for us, unfortunately.... :/We wanted to love this place, but uh, we won't be coming back.
5	My quick summary:  Perfect for splurging on a romantic evening.My fiance took me here last night for an overdue romantic evening together.  I had never been to The Melting Pot before because I didn't understand paying so much to cook most of your own food.  But if my sweetie is paying...  Well sure, why not?  :PI was immediately impressed.  The hostess seated us immediately, took a complimentary picture for us and our waitress arrived to take our drink orders right away.  Their blackberry sage lemonade may just be my new favorite drink.  My fiance had a margarita, the waitress recommended it because she was also this evening's bartender and makes a mean Margarita. Well, she was right.  And our service was never lacking.  Quite a feat to bar tend and serve us all at the same time.  She also knew what changes had to be made to all the courses we ordered for my gluten free dietary needs, they're very well trained there.The tables are small, intimate, and closed in by a curtain.  There is a small burner at the back of the table for the fondue pots to be heated up on.  The booths were quite comfortable.  And the low lighting certainly creates a romantic feeling.The first course was a gluten free beer and cheese fondue with scallions on top.  They brought us bowls on fresh veggies (broccoli, cauliflower and carrots) and bowls of crisp Granny Smith apple slices.  I'd never eaten fondue and had no idea what to expect.  But the flavors were amazing.  It was creamy, cheesy goodness that was paired very well with the vegetable and fruit flavors.The second course was a Wisconsin wedge salad.  This course was OK, but not my favorite.  It wasn't bad, but it's really just a partial head of iceberg, ranch, bacon and a flavorful cheese on the side.  This is just my prejudice.  I don't like only iceberg in salads.  It's bland and holds almost no nutritional value.Our third course was the main meat course.  We got extra shrimp (had to substitute out some pasta), pork tenderloin, buffalo chicken, slices of beef, and more veggies.  They bring you sectioned plates for all the dipping sauces, a plum based one that's like a sweet & sour, a yogurt curry one, a creamy cheese one good with Buffalo chicken, and a creamy veggie dip.  They told us exactly how long to cook each meat so it gets cooked perfectly.  It was all seasoned perfectly with a small amount of heat.  Everything was quite flavorful.Our dessert course was the S'mores chocolate & marshmallows, minus the graham cracker crumbles.  They were even kind enough to bring my fiance a small plate of rice crispy treats because those aren't certified gluten free, but he loves them.  And we shared a plate of large strawberry slices, pineapple, marshmallows, and banana slices.  One word: divine.  The chocolate was rich, creamy, and addicting, with a hint of marshmallow.  Their dessert is the perfect end to a romantic meal.I've heard a lot of people complain about the price, but I think it is really a fair deal.  Now, hear me out before you throw rotten produce at me.  A full meal here takes at least an hour and a half, probably more like 2 hours, or more depending on this size of your party.  It does not have the quick turnover the vast majority of restaurants have.  And it's really about paying for the experience.  It's fun, romantic, and if you've never had fondue, a learning experience.I think this will easily become my go-to romantic date night location...  However few and far between they may be.
5	My boyfriend and I came for our one year anniversary and boy was I surprised! I've always wanted to come to the Melting Pot but I never had a reason to spend so much money on Fondue!When we got to the restaurant we were quickly seated in this secluded booth that was tucked away in the wall, then they closed a curtain in front of our booth and it was completely private! I thought that was so much fun!Our servers name was Dan and he was great, very attentive and he walked us through the menu, (which was a little overwhelming), and made helpful suggestions.We ended up doing the four course meal which came to like $90 dollars and it was SO GOOD. We started with what Dan suggested, the Spinach and Artichoke cheese dip which was served with granny smith apples, various breads and veggies. Dan made it right at our table which was great too!  When we took our first bite we were both immediately "wowed".  Then after that we both got our own house salad, the house dressing was great. When our main course came we chose our broth to cook our meat in and the meat we got was lobster tail, shrimp, pork, buffalo chicken, mushrooms in noodles (dumpling like) and beef. They were served with various sauces which I liked. Then last but not least, desert! YUM!! We decided on Bananas Foster and omg so great! The pound cake and brownies it came with was so good. I may have to come back just to get some more desert at some point! lol. We ended up spending close to 2 hours here and it was really a wonderful romantic night! I loved the atmosphere and how our server cooked our food right in front of us. I look forward to coming back here in the future!
5	Usually make it here about twice a year for special occasions but heard about some great happy hour deals so hopefully will make it more often. Love the cheese fondues!
5	Great meal great service. Wife and I came here tonight for our anniversary and had a great experience. Even the music was perfect.
2	This restaurant is okay. The food is good, but not fabulous. And it's very expensive for only a so-so dining experience. I went there once, that was enough.
1	We've been trying to use our Living Social deal to this place for a couple months now... we finally had the chance on Saturday night.  My take on Melting Pot has always been that the cheese and the dessert are awesome - but that I could pretty much do without the meat course in the middle.So we started with the spinach artichoke cheese fondue, which was really really good.  The wedge salad with bacon and peppercorn ranch, also good.  Then we got to the meat course.  Without turning this into a novel, we discovered that one of the shrimp that had been cooking in our broth fhad not been de-turded.  That's right, it had been cooking with the rest of our meat, in poo-broth.  So, there goes the appetite, and after bringing it up to the waiter - and his discussing it with the manager - they were "gracious" enough to take a $5 beer off our tab.I'm sorry, but serving poop to customers, should pretty much be a no-no.  Especially at those prices.  I kept thinking of the line from one of my favorite movies, The Jerk, "You would think, at these prices, you could keep the POOP off the food!".I digress... suffice it to say, we won't be going back to The Melting Pot.
1	Seven of us took my daughter there for her birthday. The service was incredibly slow. Over three hours for food we cooked at the table!  The food quality seemed ok but the bill was over $500 and only two alcoholic drinks were served. When we left my 28 year old son wanted to stop and grab a burger. He is not overweight in the slightest and there was not enough food for him. After talking to the remaining guests everyone felt that way. I'll never be back. I'd rather spend $700 at a better restaurant.
5	We went here tonight for our anniversary.  This is our second visit to this location, and it has been a wonderful experience both times. I have always been impressed with the friendliness of the staff and their professional manner.  We have always come with coupons because it's the only way we can afford to go, and even though they are a high-end place, they have never looked down on us for that or treated us poorly.  We still feel like we're getting the best experience.  I wish I could remember our server's name, because she was wonderful.  The food, of course, was delicious.  We had the spinach artichoke cheese and endless entrees. Our server recommended the Mojo broth, and it was awesome!  Flavorful, tangy, and a little bit of spice. It went well with everything.  I don't think I tried anything I didn't like.  If you have never been here before, one thing to keep in mind is that it's a very intimate dining experience.  I recommend it for families and serious couples. You'll be eating close together since you're sharing a fondue pot, and this also means you're all putting your skewers in the same pot, so don't go there with anyone you wouldn't feel comfortable doing this with!  And also, it's expensive, so I wouldn't recommend it for a first date. I think this is a lovely place for special occasions, and I look forward to future celebrations there.
1	I'm not sure how I was so mistaken about how great a restaurant was, when the premise is you boil the main course of meat to eat it. Mmmmm, delicious boiled meat has been said by no one, ever. We used to love the Melting Pot in NC before moving here. Going to this restaurant was an event and you knew you would be dropping some serious $$$ to eat there.  When I saw the Living Social deal for $45 for $75 it seemed like a no brainer and a fun evening out. Boy was I wrong. To me, $45 for $75 says they are going to give me a $75 credit for the tab of whatever I order. For a tab that can be close to $200, this seemed like a deal so I bought it. I was surprised when we arrived and was given a "Prefixed Living Social" menu instead of a credit on whatever we would like. This, I also noticed, came with smaller portion sizes than what the regular menu came with. So they limit what I can order, but expect me to tip on whatever the full amount would have been without a credit?  We upgraded some of our choices knowing it would be more expensive, but it still didn't make for an enjoyable evening.The locations in NC are set up so no booth is right across from another booth, they are kind of staggered for privacy, here felt like we were eating at TGI Fridays. The couple that was set directly across from us had requested a more private table that could not be accommodated and they made a scene. Uncomfortable, to say the least and not the date night I had in mind.You better be a fan of garlic to eat here, because aside from the dessert, it's in every choice of every course and something about a plate of raw meat and seafood being set down in front of you, with instructions of how long to let it "cook" as in- if it walks boil two minutes, if it swims boil a minute and  1/2, is less than appetizing. Our total bill came to $180 (before the $75 credit or tip) and we left disappointed, vowing to never return. Our Living Social Deal also listed we would be given a complimentary champagne toast, which we were not even offered.  I get that we purchased a "coupon" but shouldn't be limited to a certain menu or treated any differently from other patrons in the restaurant.  This place was not worth the 3 hours we spent there, "deal" or not.
3	So, I came here with a voucher for a 3-course meal for 2 plus a champagne toast which was a good deal, but about all I'd pay for the food we got. If you don't have the living social voucher, I'd spend your money elsewhere.The quality of the food is just OK. Besides the meat, which was delicious, but served in very small portions, it was substandard, especially for the price. (our total would have been over $100 if we didn't have that voucher).It might just be because I'm allergic to wheat, shrimp and apples, but I couldn't eat half the things they brought us.Also, when our main course came out, with raw meat just sitting there, our waiter said he'd be right back with the cooking times ... he brought them crudely scribbled on what looked like a used napkin which I thought was kind of unprofessional of the restaurant.Finally, at the end of our meal, the manager came over and asked if we wanted to donate $10 to St. Jude's children's hospital and we'd get a $20 gift card. I thought, heck why not? It's basically getting $10 for free. So, I did the donation..... but when I received the card, I realized it wasn't a gift card at all - it was a $20 off coupon for spending $50 next time at The Melting Pot. I definitely felt  misled.Overall, subpar. 3 stars is pretty generous ... I'll give it to them for ambience and because my boyfriend loved it.
5	Came here with my sister and brother in law for New Year's Eve. What a wonderful decision. We had 7pm reservations and it was nice to arrive and be seated immediately. The place was busy, but very well organized. The food is good, but I have to say it's the overall experience that earns the five stars. Tonight, that experience was facilitated by a very delightful server by the name of Lisa. We had the French onion cheese fondue for starters, I had a Caesar salad. The pine nuts are wonderful, I think they were candied, which added a great sweet and savory component. We went with the coque vin (sp?). It is really a great broth for the entree. We did the cuts and added a couple lobster tails. All wonderful. Then dessert. Oh my yum. We went with the snicker doodle which was chocolate, peanuts, butterscotch schnapps, and baileys. Wow. As if we weren't already full. It was like we were addicts and couldn't stop. Until we realized if we kept going it wasn't going to be pretty. The meal included champagne toast and they gave us each a swag bag which included their wonderful wine salt and a voucher for $25! They also took our picture and we each got a framed copy as a momento. I was very impressed. Usually I like to go all out for New Year's Eve and go out and hit up a party scene. This year I wanted something low key with family and The Melting Pot gave 2012 the perfect send off. I want to give a special thanks to Lisa for being so tremendously awesome. PS - I joined yelp just so I can review this place!!!
3	Let me start off by saying that the service was absolutely great. I couldn't have asked for a better bartender or waitress. Now that being said - maybe this place isn't so bad if you're into paying an arm and a leg to cook your own food. I came here hungry so it was a bit of a pain to have to wait minutes in-between bites.The upside to the slow eating process is the great time you get to spend with your date conversing and not rushing through a meal - that's always a great change of pace. Atmosphere was dark and relaxing and seating was very comfortable.
1	First timers at the Melting Pot....perhaps our last?    We weren't too happy about hidden costs they don't let you in on.  We went there for a special Valentines dinner and we were charged $5.95 for broth to cook our food..... "Hello.... How are we supposed to cook our meat?"   Why should we be charged for that???   We went with 3 couples and were charged that 3 times and we only had 2 pots!    Another "go figure" why when I order my meal off their special Valentines menu consisting of their serf and turf for $66.95 do I not get my own lobster?  My husband and I had to share it.  My father-in-law had his own surf and turf and had a full lobster!  He was lucky his dining partner ordered the other choice offered, the turf.Hardly want to go into the gratuity that is included in the price!  That really bothers me when they do that..... Lucky for us she was a good waitress.
4	Great place for a date night! Don't come really hungry. I recommend going for drinks and dessert.
4	A bit overpriced for melted cheese, but always tasty.  The tricks are going on the girls night out - a fixed price 3 course menu or during happy hour for cheese and chocolate.  Staff is always friendly and helpful.
5	As always great service and lots of fun its a tad expensive for fondue but its worth it especially for special occasions
1	Oh hell...we won't be going back! lol After having an amazing dinner at San Tan Brewery where we sat outside and enjoyed our night we decided to splurge and have dessert somewhere else for some added fun to our evening. So we thought, "Hey let's try The Melting Pot." I had been a few years prior and thought it was completely over priced and not at all worth what you pay but my hubby had never been so I wanted him to have that fondue experience.We got there about 40 minutes before they closed and they immediately sat us in this claustrophobic little booth...thing. The last time I had been there I was with a party and we sat in a regular dining area. Yes this little booth was intimate but it really doesn't do them any favors. By having such little space and a closed curtain you start analyzing everything around your small area. Like how there was food splattered and stuck to the wall. Or how the wood along the wall had been essentially burned away over time from the heat coming off the fondue pots. Or how there was a HUGE uneven crack in the middle of our table. Everything just seemed outdated and grimy. After a few minutes our server came and asked for the drink orders. My hubby ordered an Irish coffee and I just wanted water. He asked me if I wanted one of the two sparkling waters they carried or "tap water". I told him tap water was fine and when he made a face I asked, "Well is it filtered water?" after he said yes I kind of just stared at him with a face like, "okay and your issue is...?" He just walked away. lol I'm sorry but I'm not going to pay your outrageous price for water, it's ridiculous, plus I'm not a fan of sparkling water. I'm perfectly fine with filtered water and this guy was trying to make it out as if I just ordered some unfiltered swamp water or something. Seriously, get over yourself. So I got my undesirable "tap water" and my hubby got his coffee. The yin-yang chocolate was brought out with the dippers and we were pretty disappointed. The cheesecake looked and tasted exactly like Wal-Mart's cheesecake, the brownies were so sugary sweet I could barely get my one piece down, the marshmallows were stale, and the bananas had brown spots on them! Although, the pound cake (I believe it was), the strawberries and the rice crispy treats were okay but it was an extremely small portion and way over priced, just like it was a few years ago. After we were finishing up my hubby still needed to finish his coffee and the server brought out the check...and then started clanking glasses, vacuuming, loudly shouting to others, laughing, and talking about inapproprate coworker drama. The place went from quiet to very noisy in a matter of a couple minutes. Apparently waiting to clean the restaurant until all the guests have left isn't something they train the staff on. It was extremely rude.All in all I'm glad we went ONLY so that my hubby could have that experience, which he didn't like, so we won't be back. Don't waste your money when you can easily buy some good quality chocolate, melt it at home, and enjoy it with fresh fruits and other dipping pieces of your choice.
5	as always amazing!!
2	A great deal more happened since my last review and you can see I did up it by one star.After my last review an employee from The Melting Pot decided to privately contact me and was rude towards myself and my review as well as made some snide remarks towards myself and my boyfriend. This really upset me so I contacted The Melting Pot's management and worked with the Area Manager, Kelly Cooper. Kelly was extremely helpful, and offered us a free dinner for the trouble we went through. Last night we took up the offer and arrived on time for our reservation. I requested for a table in the main dinning area, rather than one of the private booths. I never considered myself someone uncomfortable in small spaces but I really didn't like the private booths the last time we were there. The booth and area seemed very clean and much more comfortable this time around.Our server was extremely personable and courteous the entire evening. Everything came out promptly and we were able to dine just under the two hour mark. I've seen others complain about how long it takes to dine here but that's really just part of the experience. Plus my boyfriend and I can sit and talk for hours so we were fine with it.The food was...okay. We had the spinach artichoke dip, which honestly was bland. We LOVE spinach artichoke dips and this was the worst one we've experienced. It lacked flavor; it needed more spices or even some kick with jalapenos. We had the Coq Au Vin broth for the entree and again it didn't really give the food much flavor at all. Our meal wasn't awful but it wasn't amazing either. As stated in my previous review I've been to The Melting Pot before and remembered how my entire family felt the food didn't match the large price you paid. I still feel the same, I dont think the food has really improved and maybe its because you're cooking it yourself. For example, we really love beef at medium rare, which you can't really do here especially since you're mixing meats and everything needs to be cooked all the way through. We love veggies steamed or roasted and well seasoned but that's not how its cooked. Without the different dipping sauces the food tastes pretty plain. It's just boiled meats and veggies, and after the boiling process the meats come out over cooked for our taste, and the veggies just seemed so boring. Also one thing I noticed, the mushrooms weren't washed; they still had that dark soil-dirt all over them. So for each one I was trying to brush off the dirt before putting them in the broth.For our dessert we chose the s'more chocolate and opted to take out the brownies, cheesecake, and marshmallows, and had them add extra of everything else. Those three treats are just way too sweet to be dipped in chocolate; the sweet chocolate is more balanced by less sweet items like the fruit, pound cake, and surprisingly, the rice krispies treats.We had a good enough time, so why is there still a low star rating? Well just under an hour after we left we both became extremely ill. I'm not exactly sure why because we followed our servers instructions by letting the meats boil for at least 2 minutes and sometimes our pieces ended up boiling longer while we had some of the veggies. Also, we didn't touch any of the raw meats to our plates either. So, we spent all last night in and out of the bathroom. Not exactly how we wanted to spend our Friday night. After some light research on Google I did find quite a few reviews on other sites, blog posts, and forum comments about people getting food poisoning from The Melting Pot.So needless to say, this will be our last visit. After the previous bad experiences, having employees angrily contacting me, and now food poisoning we're not planning on going back. The only reason I upped the star rating is because the manager, Kelly, was so understanding with my complaints and took my concerns seriously.
4	My husband and the in-laws went here last night as a part of Arizona Restaurant Week. None of us had ever been and we wanted to give it a try. The concept is fun and so good for groups. This location is ok, next time we'll have to try the Scotsdale one. However, not sure if we really will go again. The service was excellent, our server was attentive and nice. The food was good, however I can't help but feel there just wasn't an adequate amount for 4 people. Looking across the aisle at another table with just 2 people it seemed we had almost the same amount. For the price I would have liked to see larger portions, especially considering we didn't even pay the normal amount!The chocolate fondue was my favorite. The brownie dipped in chocolate was to die for. Overall we had a good time. This is more a spot for the experience than the food.
2	This was our first time here and all I can really say is, Meh. We walked into the restaurant and waited 5 minutes for someone to come to the hostess stand. Then we waited another few minutes for the woman to escort us back. She was nice, but there should have been someone at the hostess stand when we walked in. So let's discuss these little booths that they have. The problem with a place that puts you in a small booth with curtains is that it gets stuffy. When the curtains open air flows in and if your server is say, a smoker, you will smell nothing but the smoke. This is what happened to my husband and I. I am very sensitive to smoke, so I think I noticed it more than him. The food was OK. The service was SLOW, it took us over 2 hours to have two cheese fondue courses and some chocolate. We might be back to check out the happy hour specials.
1	Ok... so to begin with - we go to the Melting Pot once a year (most likely on our anniversary) so we have a very good idea of what to expect. Every year we have gone to other locations we had an amazing time with everyone very attentive to our needs and the level of service that made spending $100-120 on a dinner for 2 seem reasonable.This year was our 5th anniversary and even though MP was not quite in the budget - we found a coupon and decided we should have a nice dinner anyways.  This was our first time at this location.  And seriously - I've had better service at Wendy's.  We mentioned to them that it was our 5th anniversary and the hostess didn't seem to care.  Not one person wished us a happy anniversary.  And not one person (except for maybe our waitress) was even half-way nice or welcoming.I don't know if that's because we had a coupon or not - but our portions were literally 2/3 (if not only half) of what original 3 course dinner is.  We felt as if we were totally robbed because after still spending $80 for a dinner for two & bad service - we were still hungry and considering going to Cheesecake Factory (which is way better by the way).Once again - this is NOT a review of the Melting Pot in general as a chain - I love a concept, I love the food - but please DO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION... worst ever.
5	This is my fourth trip here with my fiancee and this place gets more delicious every time. The new premium meat dippers are fantastic. Our server Bethany was great and very helpful regarding new menu changes. We had the spinach artichoke cheese and it made our month. We get a different cheese every time and they never disappoint. 5 stars
2	We ate here this Saturday night, August 31 using a DealChicken voucher that we had purchased for $99.The voucher was for a 4-course menu of endless fondue, including a cheese fondue to start, 4 sales, an endless fondue entree, chocolate fondue for dessert, plus a bottle of wine. This was supposedly a $200 retail value. In addition, a 20% gratuity, placed on the full value of the meal, before tax, was to be added.While the service was fine, and I really don't have too many complaints regarding the food, this was the first time I've ever been mislead by a restaurant when purchasing a voucher. The actual retail value, according to their menu, was $168.80, not $200. This included 4 endless fondue entrees at $36.95 each, plus a $21 bottle of wine.While I understand that restaurants take a fraction of their regular margins when accepting a voucher from DealChicken, Groupon, Living Social, etc., it's a marketing decision they have decided to make to hopefully attract new customers. I was very disappointed to find out that this Melton Pot location had inflated their base prices before selling the voucher, and included a mandatory gratuity based on that same inflated value.While I have no issue tipping 20% for great service, I prefer to tip on the actual value of the meal... not an overstated number.While the food was okay, I can't in good heart return to a restaurant that nickels and dimes its customers. This was very disappointing and I expected better from a national chain.
3	A nice date night. Thank you living social.  This was my 1st time eating here. Food and service was good overall.  I wish the seating was a little more private. Booth seating with people all around is not exactly quaint.  I would go back with another Living Social deal, but would not go and pay full price.
5	I bought a living social deal and decided to check this place out. HOLY SHIT! Amazing place. It was my first fondue experience. The deal on living social was awesome. I got wine, apps, main course, and desert. I ended up buying a bottle of 7 deadly zins which they listed for $70. It's only $15 at bevmo, so I got suckered on that one. The food was awesome. Our server was a good guy. He was super friendly and made the experience very enjoyable. If you're cheap or looking to pinch pennies, this is not the place to take a date. It's expensive, but I think it's worth it. The atmosphere is very nice. It's more of a fine dining experience. I had a great time and I'll be going back again.
2	Prior to arriving to the Melting Pot we made reservations for 4 (the next table was available at 9pm) and had looked at some of their specials. We knew they had a three course option for $30 since it was AZ Restaurant Week and they also had a company special which was endless fondue (which was really just endless entree) for around $37. Half of us were carnivores and opted for this choice, which caused real confusion for our waiter, so we all agreed to just pay the $7 more (not a big deal since we were getting endless shrimp and filet). The cheese course was fine but the salads were small and mediocre. When the salads arrived we had asked for salt, which our waiter never brought. One person in our party had been waiting to enjoy their salad with some salt so it wasn't until another employee dropped our entree broth 10 minutes later that we got the salt. After a lengthy wait,(I believe there was now only one other table in the place), our server came to ask if we would like to order drink refills first before he brought our long anticipated entree....Finally, we received our entree, perhaps adequate for two people, but certainly not four. The waiter did make a good recommendation on the mojo cooking style (but had implied that it was included in the price of the special). After sitting with no food for another 20+ minutes, we were given the dessert menu, I asked about refills on the beef and shrimp. He later returned with 5 shrimp and about 6 bite size portions of beef. Five minutes later, we began our wait again for our next "endless entree" refill. The waiter returned to our table and asked if we would like to take our dessert to go?!! Really?!! Sure, let me just swing past Williams-Sonoma & pick up a fondue set! He seemed a bit shocked when we said no and advised him we had been waiting for more shrimp. We wanted one more refill when he came to the table with another employee following behind us holding our dessert (who then proceeded to turn around in a very disgruntled manner). I would have been more understanding if they had been busy or we had not seen the waitstaff standing idly while we were waiting for food and drink refills. It took 3 hours and $240 to have what you you would normally enjoy in appetizers or at a tapas bar. Again, no complaints on the food quality, but the slow service and lack of refills on both food and drinks made it seem like the most expensive meal, gram for gram, that I have ever eaten. I would have much rather spent it at a nice steak or seafood establishment. The decor is also quite dated and not nearly as "romantic" as I had envisioned. Probably an OK place to take a first date and share an appetizer fondue before going somewhere for a real dinner.
5	With some trepidation after reading other reviews from people who used coupons, we went for dinner to Ahwatukee Melting Pot. We have been there before and were always happy with meal but wondered how coupon would change it all based on other reviews.  This time two of us were on coupon and the third decided to get 4 course.  He says "what a great meal for $36!"   Jennifer was our very entertaining server. She was quick on the "merlot" refill. Wink wink (she will know what we mean). Quick service and very fast on bringing generous refills of shrimp and tenderloin which we consumed the fastest.  All in all a great meal and loved the dessert!!  Jennifer earned her 20% gratuity.
1	Prior to our evening we made a reservation online. We specified a booth for health reasons of our guests. When we were shown to our table it was a half booth, we told them requested a booth and the hostess proceeded to tell us that all of the tables have some booth so we should have called to specify. If I wanted to call I would have made my reservation that way. After arguing she led us to a full booth. Strike OneAfter being given menus I asked about the endless fondue, the all you can eat. Our server said that it was a living social deal and not available to us. After looking on my phone at living social I told him I didn't think he was correct and THEN we were given a special menu for the endless fondue. Strike TwoWhile ordering the endless fondue we were told to pick ANY cheese, cooking style and dessert. No mention was given to any upcharges for our choices and yet when the bill came we were charged for our "special" choices outside of the deal. Strike ThreeWe have been going to the Melting Pot for years and never had such bad service. The bill was about $30 more than expected due to staff not knowing their own offers. We sure didn't feel welcome. They are out of our restaurant choices now.P.S. one of us, the vegetarian, left disappointed and hungry.****UPDATE**** The manager contacted me and made me an offer: I would like to drop a couple of gift certificates to you in the mail. What happened on your visit is not what we do, or who we are. If you could reply with your address, I will get them in the mail this week.****UPDATE****** received the "gift certificates"....they were coupons that required two entree and two cheese fondue purchases to be used....NO THANK YOU.
2	Ok so we went to the Melting Pot and although it was nice, everything is extra. I mean you get this deal on Living Social and it says one thing ok...but you want to cook your meal you have choose a method and that's extra...that was pretty lame for me . They bring you the food to cook and its a small bowl of veggies with 1/2 a small red potato it was as if my husband and I were going to have to arm wrestle for it (I won he was not looking) the kids plate is JUST THE MEAT and if they choose ravioli mixed in its 2 raviolis. Also its suppose to be all you can eat of the entree but the server is already picking up the plates and offering dessert which is another ghastly over priced affair. So I went in there thinking wow we are going to try something new and not break the bank and boy was I wrong. No wonder its a date place, back when you are dating you live on a leaf of lettuce and a glass of wine, LOL. I am looking at my receipt and there is a charge for almost $30 and I am going to call and ask them what that was cause I don't remember. $6 for a half glass of wine is a bit much, 50 cents to refill my kids lemonade glass its like really? The 2 dessert portions were really nice I will give you that much for we had to shell out $15 for a piece of cheese cake the size of my thumb and probably what is 1/4 sliced banana to dip among 3 marshmallows and two thumbprints of a brownie. I really really really don't think we will ever ever I mean never go back there its just kinda nuts.I'm also going to let Living Social know, this is not a deal and I'm sorry I promoted it to people I know.
2	For such a high-end restaurant, they sure don't treat you that way. I made a reservation online for a booth, and when I arrived, they tried to give me a table. When I explained that I had reserved a booth (and for a reason), the seating hostess actually argued with me that it was technically half of a booth. I couldn't believe she was trying to convince me to take the table - the restaurant was empty! When I insisted that we have the booth we reserved, she finally took us across the restaurant to a booth. While the food was very good (especially the desert), the service was not. I walked out of there feeling like I paid nearly $50 a person for the same service I could get at any chain restaurant for $20 a person.Definitely not impressed, and I won't be going to this particular restaurant again. I'm disappointed because I remember that The Melting Pot used to be such a well-known,  high-class restaurant.
5	Our friends joined us for a relaxing three hours of fun, fellowship and awesome food.  What an experience.  The service was very personal.  We were all impressed.
5	Took the wife here for date night, love the food here!! service is world class. can't say a bad thing about this place, except I wish they had one closer to our neck of the woods.....Gilbert that is!!
5	We had a great time for our anniversary! The fondue was amazing. We went with the endless fondue, and that was a great choice! Delicious!
1	I really don't know where to start..........IT WAS NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE AT ALLThe food was totally mediocre to say the least "WHAT THERE WAS OF IT"  There was 4 of us and the serving of ALL the items (especially the condiments) was ridiculous.  For 4 people and in all the condiment dishes "I 'M NOT KIDDING" THEREWAS 1/4 tsp in each you couldn't even smear it on to use.......ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.Our waiter "David Blane"look alike' was very rushed........took away items we were not even finished with.  There never was enough cheese to share, or chocolate for the dessert for that matter.OH YES CHOCOLATE....IT WAS HERSHEY SYRUP served cold and by the time it warmed up........we were done or it was gone???THIS FOR  A AVERAGE OF $55 PER PERSON..........NO BEVERAGES INCLUDED sooutside of thinking of  a nice way to phrase this...........NOT GOING BACK - EVER -PISSED OFF for being taken advantage of AND IT WAS A BIRTHDAY TREAT !!!So much for that GREAT EXPERIENCE "THAT'S A BS STATEMENT" ALSO !!!! If I ever heard of one.SO words of advice....Don't waste your time and most of all your MONEY !!BECAUSE YOU WILL AND PLEASE MARK MY WORD YOU WILL BE SORRY !!
5	Our visit was the climax to a wonderful eveing out and the staff were so awesome in describing their menu and how it all worked.
5	We spent our ninth anniversary here! The food was delicious! We each had the four course meal with endless meat. We added our own desserts with the curtains closed...lol. Very fun!
5	We had a great experience!  This is a really nice place to go for special occasions.  The booths are so private with the curtains and the service is excellent!  The food is amazing and the experience is unique.
5	This place is amazing, not too mention Delicious!  We enjoy the 4 Course Meals with some friends and dip, ate, laugh, dip tell we couldn't eat another thing.  Highly recommend especially for a celebration of any kind.
2	I have always loved the melting pot, I have been to the Portland, OR and a Seattle, WA locations and have had awesome experiences. Not at this place! I went there for happy hour today, other than my sister and I, there were only 4 other people at the bar and we still got terrible service. The bartender was unfriendly and too busy hanging out with her friends in the corner, talking about their DUI's, so professional. We had planned on staying there for a while, trying the fondue and have some drinks, but because of the service, we left as soon as we could. Never coming back.
5	My husband, sister, and I had a four-course dinner at this location this past month. It was mine and my husbands first time at fondue. We had a lovely experience and would go back for special occasions/date nights! The server had a lot of knowledge and was very helpful for us first timers. The cuts of meat were nice and they brought out extra dippers for the cheese. The GM came out twice to see how were likes our food and the server. Overall, thy had very tasty good, good service, and a nice ambiance.
5	My girlfriend and I went here for our valentines day dinner. It was excellent. Obviously it's more on the expensive side, so it may not be an "everyday" kind of place, but if you're looking for something for a special occasion or a romantic night out, this place is perfect.My girlfriend is allergic to gluten and they had no problems accommodating that restriction. They all knew immediately what to do and we're knowledgable on the menu as it related to gluten.Our server was a guy named Dan, and he was friendly, attentive, knowledgable and helpful throughout the whole meal. He suggested good foods, gluten free foods, good wines and answered any questions. Overall, I would highly recommend the melting pot.
5	This is my husbands and my favorite place to eat! The staff is always super nice and friendly and willing to move us if we needed a two burner table or something like that.  The food is delicious!! It's a long meal...we are usually there define about 2 hours.  LOVE THIS PLACE!!
1	Don't waste your time or money, this place sucks big time.  Tasteless food, shotty service. I would never go back!
5	The Melting Pot is not just a restaurant, it's a dining experience. Expect it to take 2-3 hours, so make sure you enjoy your company!My husband took me here for Valentines day (my review is belated) and it was nothing short of amazing. The service was friendly, but not annoyingly so, and it felt really private and relaxing. The food was delicious and plentiful. I can't imagine how someone could think otherwise honestly. It's a 4 course meal. We had PLENTY of food left over and we were stuffed. I would highly recommend this place for a night out with your SO, a double date, a girls night, or anything else slightly festive. Dinner after work with the family? Not so much.
5	We came here for my wife's Birthday.  It was my first experience at The Melting Pot and it was a great one.  We were greeted upon walking in and seated right away.  They seated us in a small private booth for two which was very nice.  Each of the booths has a curtain that they pull shut so you feel like you are all alone.  There was only a "dull roar" from the other guests in the restaurant, so it was very nice.  Our server was excellent.  She was outgoing and very helpful in explaining the menu.  We got the cheese and chocolate fondue with a salad.  All three courses were great.  We had the cheddar fondue which you can't go wrong with.  The different varieties of bread that we dipped in the fondue with delicious. My wife and I both got the house salad, hers with ranch and I got mine with the house dressing.  My dressing was sweet and the salad was very good. I would probably try it with ranch next time as ranch is my go-to dressing.  We finished off with the chocolate fondue which was amazing.  It had strawberries, rice-crispy treats, marshmallows, etc.  Dessert was the best course of the meal.  It was a little on the pricey side for us, but a great choice for special occasions and well worth it!  It may be my choice for my Birthday dinner later this year :)
5	As always great service and food! Went for date night on a Friday and was seated quickly and with an amazing waiter! Had the spinach artichoke cheese fondue, chicken in court bouillon and the strawberry shortcake chocolate fondue...All of it was AMAZING!! I also had the sailor's punch which was nice and fruity. The total for two with drinks was just under $100 so it's not a cheap night out...but definitely worth it every once in a while :D
5	love this place. great for couples and the best cheese and Chocolate !!
1	We never even ate. We got there and it was basically empty except for a drunk, loud, very loud female teacher at the bar. It was several beats before a very prententious male, looked up and said, "Can I help you?"  no greeeting, no welcome, just Can I help you? I should have told him I needed my lawn mowed. I say, "table for two?"he said, "Amanda?" "No," say I. he said Please have a seat, we will be with you as soon as possible, whereupon we joined the other recalcitrant reservation free coouple. Amanda was behind me on the line, which ended with her and was promptly seated. He walked away, a young woman came to the desk, made no eye contract and I kid you not, moved a stack of menus from a ladder to the desk, took another stack on a walk about around the empty restaurant and returned with them. Melting Pot? More like the Prententious Pot. It was like the Soup Nazi meets the airport scene from "Meet the Parents".We left and went to a place that does not require a crystal ball to enter.
4	**Edit: The GM made a point to reach out after this to apologize and explain that my experience was out of the ordinary and that they pride themselves on providing an exceptional time for their guests. Having worked in the industry for years, I appreciate this effort to go above and beyond to rectify the situation, and will be giving this location another shot in the future. ** I have always enjoyed my experiences here, but last night's fell short. I made a reservation online on Monday, and a few hours later got an email telling me it had been cancelled. When I called to figure out why, the manager explained that they were switching reservation systems, and that they still had the reservation. I made a point to confirm that we were coming in for my boyfriends birthday, and would like to sit in one of the more private booths off to the side. He said that wouldn't be a problem, and went on to explain that they take a picture to remember the evening. When we arrived, we were walked past 6 unoccupied private booths, and sat at a regular table. The service was standard, the food (as always) was excellent. We had the never-ending fondue and added the lobster. The only reason this review is even getting 2 stars is because of how delicious everything was. At no point was my boyfriends birthday even aknowledged, no manager stopped to see how the meal was going, nothing. At the end of the meal, I walked back past the 6, still unoccupied, private booths, to ask about why we were not able to be sat there, and why our special occasion had been ignored. He said they could only guarantee a private booth if you buy a package. I understand this, but with 6 open booths for 2.5 hours, I imagine it would not have been an issue for us to sit there, as promised. When he offered to take care of something on the bill, I explained that I had already paid because I did not want him to do that. I was not looking for handouts, I just wanted him to aknowledge that I could have had a more special experience at an Olive Garden or heck, even an Applebee's would have been better. Overall a disappointing experience. Will not be going back to this location.
3	First things first: the food was delicious. Absolutely no complaints there (unless you count "wanting a dozen more brownie pieces in my MOUTH" as a complaint). The prices during Happy Hour are awesome, so if you're worried about cost.. definitely check out their HH. We went on Wednesday evening around 5:30 and there was only one other couple at the bar. We each only had one drink, but they were stroonnnggg, which is pretty awesome considering they were only like 5 bucks. The only complaint I have is the customer service I received. Angie was our bartender, and wasn't friendly in the least. She started out about average, but by the time we left, she was literally SLAMMING things around... I guess hinting at us that we were taking too long? We were unwinding, relaxing from a hard day's work, and weren't in any hurry. She told us that Happy Hour ended a few minutes ago (it was about 6:10 at this point), and that "any other employee" would be charging us full price from this point on instead of HH prices. We told her we were more than happy to pay full price. This didn't seem to make her any happier. She was so frustrated that she actually ended up dropping and breaking a few glasses while drying them off.Overall, I would visit The Melting Pot again, but I'd steer clear of this waitress because she definitely ruined the experience. When I have a bad day at work, I like to relax.. ya know, chill out... I don't want to deal with a pissy bartender!!
5	I have only been to this location for happy hour but have enjoyed it thoroughly on many a Friday afternoon.   The prices are great and the server Angie always takes good care of me.   I don't think I have ever sat there with an empty glass waiting to be filled.   I also appreciate the extra mile that she goes to make sure I don't feel lonely even though I always come by myself.  This treatment is exactly what will keep me coming back to this Melting Pot.
5	This place is so awesome!  The food, atmosphere, the service!  Do u want a great evening with people u care about?  Ask for Sierra, she will make an  amazing event  night for ur friends and family !  The food is amazing!  The place is super clean!  All around, this joint is first class!  Even the Manager is awesome!!  He made sure we (and all the guests there) were having a great experience! Rare to find it all come together in one place!  I will be back!
1	Our very presence in their lobby was an inconvenience to them. The manager was extremely rude when we asked for a table w out a reservation. No offer to wait just a blunt 45 min wait along with a snarky comment as we left "do not take any more people with out a reservation". Thanks for the rude interaction were headed to Cheesecake Factory.
5	It was our first time here and everything was FANTASTIC! The hostess was super nice, our server Brad, was so helpful, polite and professional. The food was incredible! We also appreciated the manager coming by the table and making sure everything was great! We also had the SMORES fondue.... It's like heaven in your mouth! We can't wait to go back!
4	This is the 4th Melting Pot I have been to, and the experience is very standard compared to what I am used to.  We were treated with respect, the experience was very smooth and fluid, and the food was delicious.Don't come here if you're on a budget, as most of the dinner options are fairly expensive, and make sure you don't have anywhere to be afterwards, as a full meal can take over two hours.
5	Me and my wife have been coming here for years. A cozy, romantic place to celebrate an anniversary, birthday or a date. You want a place for a first date? Come here. We always go with the four-course dinner. Everything is included. You get your cheese fondue, I recommend the "Fiesta" cheese. You get a great salad and then you choose your entries and finish with a chocolate fondue. The entire time your are here is so relaxing. We have been here for 1-2 hours, just enjoying each other. You lose track of time, because there is no hurry. You cook everything at your table in the pot on your table. Its so fun and different. We are always treated so good here. Now you will spend some money here, but if you really want a special night, this  is the place. I Give it a GIANT Woo Hoo!
5	The Ultimate in fine dining!  The atmosphere, food, and staff were incredible!   What an amazing experience.   Great for a party of 10 people!  A personal "shout out" goes to the General Manager, Devin who was super professional and accommodating!  Thank-you for a perfect evening with family and friends.  I would recommend The Melting Pot in Ahwatukee in a heartbeat!   I can't say enough about how special it was for a special occasion in our lives.
3	Make sure you have a reservation if you go on a weekend day. We stopped by a couple of weeks ago hoping to be able to get a table. Unfortunately it was a 4 hour wait. We went ahead and made a reservation for the following weekend.The ambiance is fantastic. A very romantic private setting with curtains that enclose your booth. The service was great too! I wasn't a fan of the cooking style for the meat.. but it may just be my personal taste. The cheese fondue was my favorite part.The food was decent but I honestly don't think it was worth the money. I think you are paying for the atmosphere and the uniqueness of the cooking style.Definitely not a place for kids
2	First off my husband and I went to dinner here on a Thursday night. When we entered there was an awkward wait for a table.  One employee left to check on something, while the other three stood there cheating with each other. As we were finally seated, we noticed the place was not busy wondering why the wait to be seated.The gentlemen who sat us fumbled with the three different menus. Again a little odd. Our waitress came and talked us through the menu. After our order, our waitress was hardly seen.  There we long waits between each course.  We would have rather gotten our food more quickly.  The gentlemen who dropped off the broth pot was awkward too and didn't way hi or anything to us. It was just as bad when he picked up the pot.Food was mediocre, it lacked flavor even with the dipping sauces.  The best part of the meal was the dessert, it is hard to mess up chocolate.  During our meal a gentlemen who looked like the manager walked by twice. Not once did he check in with us to see how we are doing.  At the end of the night it too a long time to get our check.  At least I was able to get the check in offer - a bottle of the garlic and wine seasoning. Which is pretty good, just wish they would have incorporated it into the food instead of using it as a "salt".
5	We hadn't been to The Melting Pot in many years, its just not super close to us.  Recently there was a groupon 2 for $37, so we purchased it thinking it would be fun to go since it had been so long.  We ordered the cheddar cheese fondue for starters.  It was good - served with bread, apples, veggies..  this was followed by the salads.Next was the entree, we choose teriyaki sirloin, filet mignon and chicken.  There were several cooking styles to pick from- we went with the Mojo, which is a caribbean seasoned bouillon.  It was really delicious, served with different sauces.We splurged and went with a desert fondue.  We picked the yin yang which was a mix of dark and white chocolate also served with a variety of dippers.  It was soooooo yummy as well!The fondue experience is what most come for I imagine, so it is nice that it is backed up with good food!  It is expensive- with out the groupon, our bill would have been $150.  That included about $30 of alcohol.I did a check in on yelp while at the restaurant and received a free bottle of seasoning- fun little surprise, I hadn't seen this before.Our waiter, Brad, was AWESOME!   Super friendly, always available but not in an annoying way and helpful with suggestions.  Give him a raise :)
4	The pros: the ambiance, the food, and the uniqueness of it all.The setting is very relaxing and romantic. We had never had fondue before, and found it very entertaining. Our waiter was attentive without being over bearing.The cons: the price and it can get pretty busy.I don't remember our exact total, but I do remember thinking "holy crap" when they brought the check. Also make sure to plan ahead. Show up without reservations and you'll end up waiting a while.Overall the experience was pleasant.
5	I took my wife to The Melting Pot earlier this evening for our anniversary dinner. Upon arrival, we were promptly greeted by the hostess and the manager, and even seated before our reservation time. Our server came out quickly, with a friendly, pleasant demeanor and a fun, quirky attitude. She was fast, courteous, informative and fun. She helped us through our first visit in detail and helped make our anniversary dinner an amazing experience. Our drink never ran empty, we never waited long for the follow-up course and no questions went unanswered. Her recommendations were solid and we had a blast. Our visit was well worth every penny! We will definitely be returning in the future.
5	Finally made it to the Melting Pot. It's been on our "must try" list for a very long time.  I've seen some reviews that complain about the service, but we didn't have any complaints. We were immediately seated (we did have reservations) and promptly served. This is not a quick dining experience,  so come prepared to spend some time and bit be in a rush.We had 4 in our party. We each ordered the unlimited 4 course meal, which is by far the best value. The cheese course was yummy, but word to the wise - don't fill up on bread! The Caprese salads were perfect - very fresh. The meat course was great. We had filet, teriyaki steak, shrimp, ravioli, and chicken. We also added the lobster tail for an additional $8. Everything was fresh, tender and delicious!We ended our dinner with the Chocolate Turtle fondue for dessert. Fabulous! Just wish we weren't so full so we could've eaten more. Our server, Steven, was on the ball, did a great job explaining everything, and we were quite impressed. Be prepared to spend a decent chunk of change there. You're paying for the experience and extra work the servers have to do, but it's worth it.
4	Food was amazing and the customer service was good. I would suggest making a reservation b/c I had to wait 45 min to be seated.
1	The service was slow and the restaurant is dated. The price and quality of food do not match up. Fun for once but maybe not again.
5	We visited here three times whilst staying round the corner in the Radisson Blu. A comprehensive menu and very good waiting staff who were happy to modify the dishes to suit. Huge portions of course and tasty meals
3	The place is old and dark. The decor is falling off the walls. The food was passable.  We went for New Years. Each couple ended up forced to pay $28 tips. Each couple!  I don't think we'll be back.  If so it'll only be for the chocolate.  That was amazing!
4	They also do not take reservations for less than 7. So, we had to go early and wait an hour as we had 6 people. I prob. wouldn't go again.
