5	This is a nice safe circle K  not like a lot of the other ones around the valley
3	Convenient place to get gas.  It's located just off the I-10 freeway and has a ton of pumps.  However, it can get really busy during rush hour.  Gas prices are a little bit higher than other stations.  There's a convenience store here if you need to get some snacks or soda.Return Factor - 60%
