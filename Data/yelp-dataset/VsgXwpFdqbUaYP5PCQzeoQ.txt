1	The snowbirds are back to the Sun Lakes area in force and the inept and overwhelmed staff at this Burger King couldn't handle it.  Not that they were that busy but these guys needed about 20 minutes per order and were only hitting accuracy at about 40% or so.I haven't been to a BK in a long time so my FFF radar was down (Fast Food Fubar).  A buy one get one coupon lured us in.I actually felt bad for one guy that seemed to be in charge.  My daughter and I stood back and watched the carnage for the first fifteen minutes waiting for our order.  Then we received our sandwiches that were not the right sandwiches.  Then we returned them and waited some more.  Then we just got a refund and left.But during that time we watched the cashier wander around and attempt to help in a hesitant fashion as if she had never been behind the counter before.  The one guy in the kitchen seemed overwhelmed, easily confused and uncertain what the difference was between say bacon, sausage and eggs.  And the guy I felt bad for kept flitting from the drive up "Oh my God that guy has been waiting 14 minutes!" to the kitchen "No, this goes here.  We're out of biscuits!  Totally!" to bagging orders "Sir, you still haven't gotten your food?  Really?"
3	I know that life in the fast food chain should be.... faster....but please if you give the order and one order is missing.....it's not good. Try to be accurate because driving back and complain is a waste of gas even if the store would refund. Damage control doesn't work here.
3	Well my food was with the exception they didn't know what #12 typically it's double cheeseburger but I actually wanted the Texas Double Whopper but somehow got a cheese burger. They looker puzzled, but correct it quickly.
