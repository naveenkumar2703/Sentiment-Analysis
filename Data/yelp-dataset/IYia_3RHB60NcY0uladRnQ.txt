1	Worst service.  My friend is trying to transfer money from her account to her landlord's bank account.  She has been in the bank for 55 minutes! And still in there!  About 20 people have come and gone. She stated that the clerk helping her was helping another customer are the same time.  Going back and forth with them.  Ridiculous! Seems like poor customer service!
1	I can't believe that I am spending time writing a review about a bank, especially after this one has cost me so much time already!! However, after countless bad experiences with basic transactions, completely inept business bankers on three separate occasions, and an ATM that seems to accept deposits a mere seven days a year, I had to spread the word. This branch, it's tellers (both personal and business), as well as their atm's are far less than acceptable. I live 30 seconds away, yet refuse to go any longer. It's a bank, I'm never going to get ecstatic over one, but I apparently can get livid. Go at your own risk, but make sure you have a plethora or time and patience if you do!
2	Average location in every way except their drive thru is NEVER open??? So why, do you have one exactly?
2	After 10 years I left wf. I opened acct with a branch on the west side. I was trying resolve the issue at this location and the rep insisted I back go to other branch to fix the problem because it was their mistake. I'm a wf cust I would think any location can help. I just closed all my accts and never went back.
