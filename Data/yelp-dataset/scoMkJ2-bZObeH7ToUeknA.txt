4	Why is that I have to go all the way to the Las Vegas Airport to relive my childhood days and joy of TCBY? Whatever the answer is, I don't care because they had White Chocolate Mousse as one of the flavors of the day and it practically made my whole trip to Las Vegas worth it. Ok, well maybe that's a bit much BUT.... did I mention they also combo the space with Pretzelmaker? An added bonus that will leave you smiling as you head home away from Sin City. Enjoy!
1	Pretzel was gross and seemed like it had been sitting there for a few days. Staff was unfriendly and looked sad. If you walk a little further, there is an Auntie Anne's which is a lot better.
3	Cute store front, limited selection.  Good access for an airport customers.
5	The pretzels were delicious and fresh!! Yummy!!
2	Not like I remember it....I think perhaps my fettish was with the Golden Vanilla...and all they had was regular vanilla, bit the consistency and flavor were not good. Bland and uber creamy, like chemicals had been added. There are better yogurt places out there now. What happened TCBY? :-( 2 stars for the good service.
