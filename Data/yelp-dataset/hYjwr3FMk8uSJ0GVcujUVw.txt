4	I haven't had any problems whatsoever with the service that this cleaners shop has to offer! I'm greeted every single time I come inside and am treated like I'm some big shot CEO of Wells Fargo Bank or something. I come here each time I need a suit altered or need an emergency press.  I don't know how many times I've turned to them to make a quick fix for a suit I need the next day. They've taken care of me each every single time.I was recommended to come here word of mouth from a good friend of mine that is really particular about his suits as I am and trusted his good judgement. I recommended this place to everyone who needs to get things done really quickly because sometimes, all you have is that last minute to do something. They don't charge me extra if I need it the next day, I just make sure with clear instructions that I will have it when I need it (past experience with other cleaners and tailors have forced me to do this).P.S. Be nice to the person who takes care of your expensive clothing :)
