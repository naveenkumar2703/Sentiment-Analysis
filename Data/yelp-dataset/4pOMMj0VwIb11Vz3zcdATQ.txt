5	This new salon in Fountain HIlls is great.  The stylists are professional and the atmosphere is pleasant.  The prices can't be beat.  $14 for a haircut with shampoo.  Great value, great place.  Give it a try.  I will be back.
5	I love this salon! Awesome atmosphere, great prices, best haircut ever! Deena rocks!
5	Deena was wonderful! I was traveling through AZ and stopped in for a haircut. She listened to me, gave me exactly what I wanted in a haircut! Wish I was closer so I could make it my regular salon! Don't let the incredibly reasonable $ for a haircut fool you, she is super skilled!!
5	I was visiting from Cape Cod MA and didn't have a chance to get a haircut before I left. I was worried about trying someplace new. I got the best haircut from Deena and didn't even have an appt.  When I got home friends even commented how much younger I looked! Music to my ears! She truly is a gift and I highly recommend Simply Marvelous. Besides the price is right at $14.
5	Deena is awesome! Took our kids in today and she gave them both the perfect cut! She was so patient with our 4 yr old. The salon prices are fantastic and her skills are definitely far beyond. Looking forward to our next visit!
5	Great place. It was easy as call, go in 15 minutes later, get haircut, and feel good about it! They had a girl helping and even she was great as Deena was busy. The price is great and you really can't beat the convenience factor! Highly recommend.
