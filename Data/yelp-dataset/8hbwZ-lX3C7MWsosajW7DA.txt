5	This is a review for Signature Productions' All Shook Up!  Preforming April 5-24, 2010.  It's $25 and roughly 150 minutes long with intermission.  I just came back from watching Signature Production's, All Shook Up!It's a musical based on music by Elvis Presley. It takes a substantial amount of talent and work for me to enjoy any production of any kind; and I rarely give anything any kind of praise. So it goes to say that, I truly enjoyed All Shook Up. It has a wonderful energy in it; talented performers, a surprisingly interesting story, and a superior use of space & stagecraft. I went with no expectations, and left feeling elevated. I desire to say so much more on the topic, but I am pressed for time.  Overall: I highly recommend it, a great value for the $25; and I believe with a larger budget, this show could be extremely successful at the Schoenfeld Theatre.
5	Saw the Signature Production of the "Little Shop of Horrors" this week end at the Summerlin Performing Arts Center. Very well done! The cast was  impressive and singing superb. If you have not taken advantage of the local community theater in Las Vegas you should check this out. It goes through August 27, 2011 and it is very reasonably priced.  Bring some canned food and you can enjoy some SkidRow popcorn!!!Enjoy!
5	I have to keep the 5 stars rating in tact because this theatre company deserves no less.  They always put on first class musicals, staged well, cast well, and full of very talented people.With Singin' in the Rain, Little Shop of Horrors, and the Sound of Music, this season has been a smash!  Have you seen it rain indoors during Singin' in the Rain?  If you missed it, you missed some wonderful stag craft.  They have in past years done Beauty and the Beast, the King and I, and All Shook Up to name a few.The ticket prices are always a bargain for the quality of the show.  Go to one of their shows and judge for yourself.  I'm sure you'll love this theatre company.
