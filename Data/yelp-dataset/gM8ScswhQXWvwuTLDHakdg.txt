3	The food was okay.  I have been to great hole-in-the-wall establishments and this one is not...but, it is a friendly spot.  It definitely is an older restaurant that needs to be updated.  Because it's old, it seems to be dirty.  The food selection isn't vast but the prices are pretty good.  It's worth a try at least once or twice.
3	I am giving the Sheep Camp 3 stars based on the fact that it was a true authentic Buckeye experience. A hole-in-the-wall establishment, looking outdated and forlorn, it was exactly what i would expect (and hoped) to find in downtown Buckeye. Food was very average, but about what i expected. Just wanted to grab some greasy breakfast, and i achieved that. Service was friendly, and i would definitely go back again if i'm in the area and need a cheap place to grab a bite.
4	So my wife and I stumbled upon this place. We followed the advice of some dude yelling to us from across the street. I must say, it quickly became our Saturday morning tradition. I recommend the "Sancho" omelet. Take the ordinary "Pancho" omelet and add chorizo instead of ground beef. "For when Pancho isn't giving you enough chorizo, its time for Sancho"
