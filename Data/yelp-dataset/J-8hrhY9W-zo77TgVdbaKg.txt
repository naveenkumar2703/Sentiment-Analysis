5	I have had really bad experiences at hair salons and this was by far the best I have had so far. I came in for a Straightening treatment and was completely satisfied with the results, it came out exactly how she said it would be. I was in there for 2 1/2 hours and the time flew by. Kelly is super sweet and extremely knowledgable when it comes to hair and is very straight forward. I would highly recommend getting services done here.
5	Kelly has been my stylist for 5 years.  I've followed her to 3 salons and I'm very excited that she's found her personal studio which has an intimate yet fun ambiance.  Kelly is a skilled artist and an avid communicator, you will get what you want.  For the record, I travel from northern Nevada just to get my hair done by Kelly, the consummate professional who is blessed with positive energy!!!
5	Ive been coming to Kelly for 12 yrs.. I absolutely love my color and highlights.  In the beginning I hated my hair due to the fact that its curly, and I had no clue how to work with it. With a great cut and color she taught me how to manage my hair!! Then in 2009 she introduced me to keratin treatment. It  has changed my life!!!! I have no frizz, it feels like silk, and it takes no time to dry and style.. As a busy working woman i couldn't ask for more. Shes reliable,consistent,and professional.. always makes me feel comfortable and confident with whatever we do..
5	Kelly gave me one of the best cuts I've ever had.  She listens to you and with her talent, combines what you want together with her expert touch, and walla.....you have a great style.
