4	This old-school fish 'n' chip joint does the dish the old fashioned way...Located in the Lincoln Plaza with Figaro's Pizza and BMO Bank of Montreal, stepping into Granny Bonn's is like stepping into the past.  If you like the way fish 'n' chips were served 20 years ago, you'll love this place!  Eating here reminds me of the fish 'n' chip places I used to go to when I was a kid.Wednesday is a special day for Granny Bonn's: You get your 2 pcs. Haddock fish 'n' chips for only $7.99 plus taxes, it's a great deal!
4	A nice little fish and chips place in Waterloo. I dropped by in the evening to get some take out. One piece of halibut with fries and coleslaw was $9.99. I always order halibut at fish and chip places even though it is a little bit more expensive than the other fishes. The halibut was nice and crispy in batter and not too greasy. If you are looking for standard old-fashioned fish and chips fare, you will not be disappointed.
4	Best sit-down fish and chips shop I've ate at in the Southern and South-West region of Ontario.The fish tastes "fishy" and batter is consistently the same without over-battering like most sports bars and pubs seem to do.  .I always order their special with coleslaw, fries, and tartar sauce. Realy like their fries too. The owner of the restaurant is always polite and energetic. They have a flow of regular clientele coming in each time I visit. There's always something interesting playing on their flatscreen tv such as BBC Planet Earth -- but sometimes seeing larvae in HD during my meal is not the best dining experience.* Remember to tip at the table because you pay at the counter (often you might forget to tip afterward when leaving).
