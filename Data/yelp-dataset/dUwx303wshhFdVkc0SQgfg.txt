4	Their location isn't great but the girls are really nice.  Rochelle always makes you feel special when you call and arrive.  I have been consistently pleased with my cuts and the service received.  Stevie is my favorite and who I recommend.  A good piece of intel for the guys is that during halloween the girls dress up.  Great time to get a haircut!!
1	I want to like this place, its close to home, and the girls are cute, but this is 2/4 times ive left this place, gone out, and people have asked if I cut my hair myself. Today people actually took pictures of it and showed me, holy hell. If they paid me for this haircut, id still want a refund. I'm leaving town for a week and won't be able to go back, nor would I trust them again. Too hotties is terrible.....
5	Perfect Cut!  Great service.... yes they do charge more.  And I leave a BIG tip.  Quality!
