5	Dr. White and his staff are awesome.  He has looked after all of our dogs with great care and compassion.  You are given an estimate of costs up front so there are no surprises.  He is careful to help your pet get the best possible care, without emptying your wallet.  The online scheduling of appointments is a very convenient tool, as well as the e-mail reminders of annual or upcoming wellness checks.  You and your pet will be very happy with the quality of care received here.
5	We had our first visit today. I called at 8 and asked for an ASAP appointment. They got us in at 8:40. The place was clean and had zero animal smell. I have a serious allergy to cats and had no problems in their office. Dr. White was friendly and kind with my pup. He thoroughly answered all my questions. They get a 5 star review for first impression. Now let's see if we can figure out what's wrong with our pup and not have cost thousands :)
5	Literally the most expensive place you could ever take your dog(s). But, I will give them this. My dog fell two stories as a puppy and they saved his life...LOTS OF MONEY later he is healthy and good as new! If I am correct, they called us every 6-8 hours to let us know how he was doing as well.. A huge plus!!
