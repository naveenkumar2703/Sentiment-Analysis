4	Service was impeccable - staff is well-versed, has FUN and was one of my fave boutiques in Vegas. Selection was well merchandised - from RTW, to accessories, to more couture offerings. Shop is a cozy gem - clever use of its compact space. Worth visiting for the eye candy alone!
3	The sales girls were very stuck up and the selection was not great.  I did buy a bag.  I wish DVF would bring out new colors in the Stephanie bag or something, they are still selling the metallic black & silver & gold for $875.00 same price it was 3 yrs ago in the same colors.  I do realize they released other colors in-between but the store only had the black n silver n gold in stock.  I will never understand judgmental sales associates, u work at a clothing store please don't judge me I have a good job. This store was a little disappointing.
