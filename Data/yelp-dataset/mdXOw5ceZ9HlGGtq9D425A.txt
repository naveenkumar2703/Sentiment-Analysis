4	Great selecton of cacti, especially smaller sized ones that are not native to Arizona.  They had some amazing stuff that is best for afternoon shade only, and wow did I find some colorful examples.  They have the standard range of Saguaro, Ocotillo, Cholla and more... but their more rare & interesting stuff is hard to beat as far as selection goes.  I thought their prices were very reasonable for the valley.Easy to find location on AZ avenue just south of the loop 202, and it's on the east side of the road.  Limited parking though.  English speaking employees was a plus as well.
4	Arizona Cactus sales is a great place and I sure wish Yelp would support half stars because they are a 4.5.  What do I like about them?:- They plant in native soil so there is no shock to the plant when dropped into our yards.  Less shock means more success.  - They mark the sun orientation based on how it was grown.  No sun shock means more success.  - They know their plants and can give you accurate information on watering, size, pests, etc.  - I've never seen anything there that does not belong in the Valley of the Sun.  I am still amazed at how many plants bigbox stores try and sell that only belong in CA.They tag plants with the scientific name so that you can learn more once you get home.  On the down side they are a bit expensive, particularly for larger plants.   Because your plants will thrive once you place them in the ground they are well worth the additional cost over bigbox.  I also must say that one of the most beautiful cactus I have in my yard is from ACS.  They sold me what they called Taylor's Pride which is a Myrtillocactus geometrizans and Isolatocereus (or stenocereus) dumortieri.  If you can get one you should.  Amazing color and beautiful flowers.
