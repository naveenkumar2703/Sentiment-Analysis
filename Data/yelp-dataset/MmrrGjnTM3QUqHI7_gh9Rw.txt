4	Good go to place for basic groceries and liquor if you're staying at the Gold Coast, Rio or Palms.  The best thing about this place is that it's open 24 hours and has a little bit of a lot of things.  You can avoid paying the hotel priced beer, cigarettes, and snacks if you're willing to walk a couple of blocks.
5	Friendly local convenience store to buy some essentials like water and snacks - better than paying more in the hotel gift shops!
1	Used to go here all the time! Never ever again :-( So, here is my sad tale of how you should never treat a customer. I was going to a circle k store and getting the 85 cent sodas for a while. Months ago DIANNE from green Valley grocery had me confused over the size of a soda refill and I gladly paid what she wanted. Well, for. The last two weeks I was refilling the same circle k cup at Green Valley grocery for 85 cents until DIANNE informed me that the price was $1.29. Embarrassed I mentioned that I had been getting the 85 cent price for the last few weeks, the same as circle k but I could do it closer to home. I told her that I only had around $1.10 on me but could she give me a pass this time? DIANNE replied that "I'll take whatever you have in your pocket this time you get your 'pass' but the manager says to watch out for you and that you do this all the time!" I have never been so damn offended at a convenience store. Ever ever. Over what amounted to a nineteen cent difference, that she would likely have left on her counter through her shift. They have permanently lost my business. No matter what I need, I'll never return.
