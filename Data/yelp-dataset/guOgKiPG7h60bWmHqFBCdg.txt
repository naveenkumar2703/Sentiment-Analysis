2	On a family vacation in Vegas last week we ate at this restaurant and experienced the worst service I think I've every experienced in my life.  We were at the restaurant at opening time in order to make a show a little later that evening and everything moved at snails pace from the moment we arrived.  The real capping moment was when after a very long wait for our food my 6 yr old's food came out incorrect.  There was a complete lack of regard from our waiter and most of the restaurant staff as to this issue and while they did finally bring a replacement there was no urgency and no apology.  In fact the replacement came 15 mins before our show was about to start so my daughter was never fed.  That's 1 3/4 hours to get a pizza.  The only reason I'm not giving it 1 start is my wife liked her food.Did I mention the point when the waiter poured water on my Dad, or when the wine was delivered but then not opened for 10 minutes....
2	Room service had an hour wait, so I tried this place. Not worth the $$$.
4	Quick and cheap, two things that you dont find often in Vegas. Everyone were super nice and smiled. If I stay here again, I'm definitely stopping in again
