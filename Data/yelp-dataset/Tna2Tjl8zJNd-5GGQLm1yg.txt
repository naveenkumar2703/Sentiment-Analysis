5	We  have used their wash and fold service for several years. The owners always do an excellent job and carefully fold each item.  Prices are more than reasonable.  Unfortunately, the couple who owned this laundromat have sold the business. Hopefully the new owners will be as caring as the old.
5	Finally!  A laundromat worth five stars! I guess I'm used to going to crusty laundromats where half the machines don't work, but I hold my standards really low.  Rarely does a laundry facility come along that really blows my mind.  Especially one that can't even spell the name of their facility correctly (wtf...really??!?).  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that all the machines in this "laundrimat" are in working order.  If you need anything, the staff are friendly and willing to lend a helping hand.  The prices are very fair, which is great - things really add up when you've hoarded dirty clothes and have to wash everything you own in one action-packed laundry day.  Another GREAT thing about this place is that it's in the same strip mall as my beloved Badger Cafe, which serves the best burgers and wings in town.  Can't get any better than that!
1	Nasty !!!! Must have changed owners cause it was nasty. Most machines didn't work, place was dirty, no one I could find to help but some dude walking around all pissed off, not sure wth he was doing
