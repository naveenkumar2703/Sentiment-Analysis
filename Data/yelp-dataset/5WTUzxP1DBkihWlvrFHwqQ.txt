1	This was the worst show I have ever seen,  it is just awfull, do not waste your money, I saw at least a dozen people walk out, many other shows in Vegas to see that are worth the money.
1	If you're a longtime Chip Davis fan like we were (seven concerts), this concert will make your head explode with boredom.  Lifeless is an understatement.  Not one word spoken for 1+30 hours.  No "Merry Christmas," "Good night," "We hate this job," nothing. No band member moved from their spot for the entire performance,  obviously bored to death with the entire event too, and a whole lot more is apparently taped since the piano music continued when both players raised their hands in the air (or should it be aire?).  The Cirque wantabe performers were pitiful.  It was a travesty.  I honestly felt $240 for tickets and a five hour drive to see it, totally wasted and over-the-top disappointing.  And I sent friends to see it, talk about embarrassing.  So, after this show, we are done.  Chip, this is not the legacy you want to leave.
1	We saw this two years ago and we are still talking about how bad it was. But we enjoy a good fiasco; there was awful dancing, awful choreography, awful costumes, awful videos and bored static musicians. It was so bad, we couldn't prevent ourselves from laughing in spasms and we sat in the second row with no one one front of us. We did see people walk out and everyone in the audience looked confused or were asleep. It was truly embarrassing for Mannheim Steamroller and while it was funny, it was the worst $300 we have ever spent.Would give 1/2 star if possible.
