2	The other day I passed by this place and realized there was a new coffee shop in Tempe. I, of course, needed to try it as a part of my Coffee Tour of Phx! FTW!!! But it wasn't a win...sadly. A friend and I got coffee here tonight. The place is really kind of shady...it looks like it is out of business kinda... Once inside it kind of feels like you are in a creepy person's basement...it's very dark and there is a performance space of sorts in the back. The barista was nice and they have information about the coffee that they use, who is a local roaster, which would be nice if it was any good. I got a latte and my friend got a vanilla latte and it tasted somewhat sour....too bitter and acidic, I drank about 5 sips before giving up on it. I don't think I'll be back....sorry guys!!
1	I couldn't get to try the coffee without getting towed from their parking lot while going to the ATM across the street.  Coffee was ok but being charged $155 for a tow while getting money across the street on a very not busy Thursday night is just not worth even trying to go back. Not ever going back for a $5 mediocre coffee.  They could have the best coffee in the world but too bad you can't park there.
4	Decent cup of coffee on one occasion, great cup of tea on another.
