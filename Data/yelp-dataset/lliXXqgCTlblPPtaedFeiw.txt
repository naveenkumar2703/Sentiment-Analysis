2	Two stars. Thats for a few reasons:Can't get out/in the parking lot without getting hit up for 'gas money' by people who are on bikesDirtier than almost any other Circle K I've ever been to. I'm from Arizona and they are as common as cactus.Their soda fountain sucks. I drink a ton of diet coke every day and they have the worst soda fountain I've been to.Not closed.
4	Nice people inside, basically just a normal gas station/mart. Only thing thats lame is thats its on a corner so its more difficult to get out of with traffic! Loves it though!!
4	Convenient (on the corner of a busy intersection) but competes with two other gas stations on neighboring corners. Staff are usually friendly and they have a wide selection of snacks and beverages. Gas is fairly priced and I usually fill up here.
1	Filthy store. The pumps are all tagged, beat u and dirty. The whole parkinglot was gross and filthy. There is no pride in this establishment.
5	Cheapest gas near the strip. Had a Radio show thing going on in the parking lot when we were there. Just a normal Circle K.
