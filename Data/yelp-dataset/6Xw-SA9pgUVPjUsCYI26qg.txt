4	I've only recently discovered AJ's Fine Foods which I understand is owned by Basha's.  In my book, that's another reason to shop there.  Arizona owned and operated, keep it local.I was pleasantly surprised when I entered the store.  The atmosphere was very warm and I found all the employees I encountered to be of pleasant disposition.  Contrast that with, oh...Safeway where I recently had a conversation with a clerk about how rotten they felt the company was.I had stopped there for lunch and they had a decent selection of prepared foods and pastries as well as coffee and espresso drinks.    They also had an olive bar and other higher end "salad bar" type prepared foods.I discovered that they carry the greatest chocolate in the world...Scharfen Berger.  If I can find it at all it is usually somewhere like World Market where they have one variety.  Here they carry about 8 varieties of this divine stuff.  That alone will bring me back.Overall they're prices were as expected...higher than a regular grocery.  But they carried higher end and gourmet foods and had a much nicer atmosphere, so I guess they fall in to the category: "You get what you pay for."
