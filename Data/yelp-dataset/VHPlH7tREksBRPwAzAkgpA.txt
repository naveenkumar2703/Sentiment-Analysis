5	I've known the owner, James Swinbourne, since 1992 (when he was just a middle school student) and I can tell you that no one in Las Vegas is more knowledgeable about repairing cars, nor more honest in his dealings with the motoring public.  He is definitely a man of great integrity, and it shows time after time in the quality of his work.He's got a one-man operation, so he may take a bit longer than "normal" to get to your vehicle and correct what is wrong with it, but I can assure you that once he starts working on it, you will get the kind of first-class service that folks have come to expect from him.I have no hesitation about giving you my very highest recommendation, regarding his professional automotive services.
5	Honest mechanic, reasonable rates and will not overchargeI've taken my car to Sin City Garage several times (and once before to James, the owner, before he had opened the shop). There has never been a followup problem, it's always done correctly the first time around. They don't try to "upsell" you with unnecessaries. In fact, they have no problem with telling you there's nothing wrong with your vehicle, rather than many other places that make things up and rip you off. Finally, a place that's trustworthy!
5	Just picked up my Escalade, they had fixed my inside drivers door handle, and replaced my leaking radiator with a new one.  Excellent service, excellent  prices.  Car was done in a little over an hour.  These guys have got a customer for life.  Would recommend this place to everyone and anyone.
