5	Great office and staff! My 7 yr old son had been going to the Surprise location since he was 3. We recently moved to the north phoenix area so we were glad knowing that WVPD had a location nearby. My son just enjoys going to the dentist. They really make it very pleasant and fun for children of all ages.
5	My little boy loves Dr. Shepard and his staff.  he actually asked him over for dinner
5	Great doctor, my child loves him. Very patient and professional. Will be back again and again. Tara, the office manager is helpful and sweet, rare and so nice to see.
