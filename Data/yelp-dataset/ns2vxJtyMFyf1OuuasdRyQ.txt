3	Getting out of Princess Street and onto Leith Walk is almost a humbling journey. Cafes down this way spend less time showing off with expensive decor and more time on the food.The Spicy Pot is like a Mediterranean Subway, very healthy sized portions of your favorite sandwich or wrap combos. But that's also the biggest problem with this place, the menu options are limited. This is a real shame because they put me together a very nice Club, made exactly how I wanted it and it tasted divine. They are more than capable than producing excellent Med food, I hope they take a chance an expand the menu!
