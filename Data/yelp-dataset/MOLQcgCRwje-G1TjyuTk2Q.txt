4	Aimed squarely at tourists, Royal Mile Armouries is unusual in that it's the only store in town i know of that sells suits of armour, broadswords and other middle-ages era battle peripherals. Given that for obvious reasons you can't take a claymore or a dagger on a plane, I'm not entirely sure how many of Edinburgh's overseas visitors will take the plunge and purchase on of ye olde killing machines, but I doubt it's that many.By lowering their prices a bit and relocating to Craigmillar, I'm sure they'd do a roaring trade, with bloodthirsty violence being an integral part of the local culture.
1	I bought a "Scottish broadsword" on a whim while on vacation from Canada. After coming home and doing extensive research, there doesn't seem to be anything authentic about the sword (It's the 5lbs hunk of metal with the leather wrap you see there and in a few other shops). The staff appear knowledgeable but in the end, they're really just salespeople and will sell you the cheapest tourist bait for the highest price they can get from you. If you can, do some research before you buy from them.
