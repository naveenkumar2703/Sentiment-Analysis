1	It's a shame, big banking has destroyed this bank.  Fees and more fees.  Stay away.    BBVA Compass has joined the ranks of banking zombies, you are a number and and not  a person.  The staff at this branch is misinformed and poorly communicated changes.  I don't think they even knew what BBVA was doing next month for fees.  $10 lost a 10 year customer.My advice, never pay banking fees.  Google Community Bank with your zip and you will find local banks that offer free accounts, free atms, and much more.
5	Very friendly and accessible staff. Great customer service. Easy to get in and out of with no super long waits.
5	Great bank to be apart of! Even though unauthorized charges are a pain and so much stress and a hassle to deal with, BBVA Compass was awesome at helping remove any overdraft charges that were not my fault. I've been with this bank for over 10yrs and do not plan on switching anytime soon! Also, this location has very friendly tellers who are always quick and helpful!
