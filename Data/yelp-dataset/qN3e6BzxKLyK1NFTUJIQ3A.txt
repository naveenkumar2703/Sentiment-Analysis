4	This fish and chip shop, like so many nowadays, is not just a purveyor of fish and chips. Ooooh no, they do pizzas, pastas, sweeties aaand fish and chips!  Okay so its a normal chippy, but Bar B Que's Pizzeria is the only one I have come across in Corstorphine and so it deserves a mention!Prices are reasonable, staff are friendly, and if I did need a special reason to highlight this slightly better than average chippy, it's the Ben and Jerry's ice cream freezer in the waiting area!  Genius appart from anything else and I am sure instrumental in the doubling of many a customer's purchase, but worth it...it's Ben and Jerry's!
4	As it has already been mentioned, this fish and chip shop does way more than just fish and chips - so I wont bore you by listing all of the items it will deep fry for you again.Instead I will point out that the food here, for a chippy is remarkably good - the chips are crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle, just how I like it and the fish is always fresh and cooked beautifully. Staff are friendly, which is a bonus.
2	The name is a little misleading.  They serve everything from Fish & Chips to Pizza.  I was staying at the Marriott up the street and I didn't want to take the bus into town to get food.  I walked by this place and decided that I wanted to try some fish & chips while I am in the UK.  They only have take-away.  It is one huge piece of fried fish.  It was piping hot and made everything soggy after being wrapped up.  They don't have any sauce to go with it.  The fish tasted fishy and I couldn't even get vinegar to take with me.  The lady sprinkled some on for me.  It is definitely a local spot, but not all local spots = good spots.
