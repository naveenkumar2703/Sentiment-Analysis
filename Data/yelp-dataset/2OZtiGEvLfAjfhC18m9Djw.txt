2	Soot on my pizza, a register Chickie who is too young to serve a beer...I stopped for a slice...great prices...good sauce...outstanding crust and toppings...BUT YOU GOT SOOT ON MY CHEESE!Because of your airport location and the number of people always in line, as well as my getting the slice to go so I had something to eat on the plane, I was unable to take the slice back and show it to someone who could do something about it.Your prices are very fair, your pizza certainly has potential...anything you can do to educate the person who got soot on my pizza will help.Yer gonna save yourself a WHOLE lot of time and gain more customers if you get someone old enough to pour a beer to run the register.  That way, the folks who order a beer can pay, get their beer and receipt and clear the register to help the next customer.  Having to wait while the cashier gets someone old enough to pull a beer is not an effective use of time or personnel...
1	Awful. Almost no cheese, and what was on it was barely covering the tip of the slice. Incredibly grumpy staff. I should have walked to another concourse but I didn't have much time. Concourse B1-14 is the orphan concourse now; so many better options for food in other concourses. Well, at least the slice was hot.
