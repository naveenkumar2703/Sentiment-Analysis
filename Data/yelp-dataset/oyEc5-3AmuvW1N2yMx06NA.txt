3	I don't come to Dansey's much anymore but this used to be my favorite hobby shop in Las Vegas.  It was my first choice for model rockets and supplies.  I preferred their old location on North Nellis Blvd.  It was bigger.  The selection was greater.  And they used to have an indoor dirt race track for R/C cars.  It was so much fun to go in there and watch the races.  The newer location now is alright.  It is not as big and parking can be a challenge being in a tiny strip mall.  The staff has remained friendly and the prices fair.
4	hard to find parking but they have a nice selection on RC parts and a few RC cars.
1	Dansey's is closed.  I don't see/know of any forwarding information.
