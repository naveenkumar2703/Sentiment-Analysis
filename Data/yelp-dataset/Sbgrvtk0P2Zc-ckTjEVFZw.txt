3	Foot Locker is home to the largest selection of athletic shoes in the mall but the pricing could be better.  Their inventory also includes a dozen or so Foot Locker exclusives like several Nike Air Max 95 colorways.  Foot Locker sweats, hoodies, and other athletic gear are generally durable, fit well, and priced well.  The Chandler store also places some focus on team athletic apparel and miscellaneous sports accessories.  The sales aren't that great.  I saw a pair of Jordan CMFT's in the white/gray/black colorway selling for $80.  I bought the same pair at a Nike Outlet in New Jersey in July for $50.  What's up with that?I can't call it...
5	Went to the Footlocker in the Chandler Mall today and recieved great customer service from Rob, very personable guy who stated he worked in shoes for 18 years, this guy wet over the top to help me find my shoes and not only that he re laced them so they werent too tight, sold me some great socks and did his job with suggestive selling me shoe cleaner (which I declined) Rob talked to my daughter and was just a good guy having fun at work which you dont see every day .....Good job Rob Thanks
4	I came to Foot Locker at Chandler Mall looking for new running shoes at a reasonable price.  I was here on Saturday, the day after Black Friday, and they still had some good holiday sales.  All the sales people were helpful and knowledgeable, and perfectly willing to go back and get me yet another size to try on, even though they were fairly busy with the holiday shoppers.  I ended up leaving with a super-comfortable pair of shoes for about 60% off the original price and some really bright and fun athletic socks.
