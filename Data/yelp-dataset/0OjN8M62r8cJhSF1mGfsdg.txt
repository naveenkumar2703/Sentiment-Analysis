4	They are fast, friendly, and they even have a dog treat for my pup when we drive through. Have never had any problems. They have never messed up our orders (a rarity in this area). That alone merits four stars!
2	Servers mixed up orders, overly salted fries, peach tea tasted rancid.
4	Food isn't great.  Standard fast food.  Shakes and drinks are good.  I like this location because its one of the few fast food options in Anthem that seems to care about customer service.  They always have a good attitude and smile and are quick.  If they do screw up they are quick to make it right.
2	Drive thur lady was very rude! I'm in the service biz and she is not friendly! Make your voice smile sweetie:)
4	It is fast food and reminiscent of all fast food.  Clearly Sonic is about shakes and deserts.  This location continues that.  What distinguishes the location is the group of young people that always have a positive attitude. They provide their name and check back with about 1/2 through your service.
