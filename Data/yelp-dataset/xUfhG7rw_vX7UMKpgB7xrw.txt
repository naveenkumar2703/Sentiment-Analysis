5	This was one of my favorite places for authentic Mexican food and their superb fresh fruit drinks (Aguas Frescas), cream desserts, ice cream and iced fruit bars.  I haven't been to any of their other locations (didn't even know they existed actually) but this location has their food on one side and the desserts on the other.  I love ice cream, and their Mexican ice cream is some of the creamiest I've ever had.  Typical hole-in-the-wall place as far as ambiance or atmosphere but you're there for the food!  Whenever I'm back in Phoenix, a watermelon or strawberry Aguas Frescas and coconut ice cream is on my list of things I gotta have!
5	just moved around the corner from Flor De Michoacan. On a referral went into check it out. WOW! The owner Floyd happened to be there and let my wife and I sample all kinds of ice cream. It was amazing! We now go almost every single day. Stephanie and Gabriella are the nicest ladies and represent well. You can see the pride in their Hispanic heritage in their service levels. You gotta try the strawberries and creme. The best. U GOTTA GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY. I just have to workout more now! lolCustomer for life,Don D.
5	one word:  awesome!
5	If you are looking for a way to cool down or somewhere to take the kids, stop by Flor de Michoacan. Everything is fresh, the ice cream, paletas, and the agua frescas! Oh the agua frescas! So delish. They have a bunch of candies and snacks too. Plus you will be supporting a local business.
