5	Best place to grab a bite or drink to escape the heat!  Try their halo-halo... I think it's the best in town.

Severely lacking of entrees to choose from and their baked goods are limited as well. Prices are a bit on the high side. Might as well go to Seafood City to buy Goldilocks pastries - generally a few cents cheaper. Lady behind the counter wasn't too pleasant nor helpful. Off day perhaps?Maybe I'm just spoiled with other Goldilocks chain stores in California. I will check out the other one at Henderson though. Hopefully that location is much better.
