5	I have been going to Jonny for 30+ years for cut and color.Occasionally when I am traveling, I've tried another hair dresser and have never found one that compares to the quality of Jonny's hair cutting and coloring skills.She is the best!
5	Alex Kern at Marbles is the best!My hair is very hard to cut (baby fine) and shows every mark, not with Alex, she is the only hair stylist for me.......young, hip, and actually listens, I won't go anywhere else.
