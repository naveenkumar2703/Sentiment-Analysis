5	Really great experience. Called before I left MSP. Got to PHX and car was ready as soon as I got my bags. Very clean and professional. Will use again when car service is needed. Well done. Thanks.
5	Always professional and great rates! If you're out bar hopping or just need a ride somewhere call these guys! I've used them for years!
5	AZ VIP and more importantly Dave have always provided the highest level of service in the transportation industry not only in Scottsdale, but anywhere I have traveled.  In the eight + years I have been using them Dave has gone out of his way on multiple occasions to accommodate me and my needs.  AZ VIP is the first call I make when I need a car in the Phoenix area.
