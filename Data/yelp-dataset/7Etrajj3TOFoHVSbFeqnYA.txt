5	Great selection of shoes from Jordan's to LBJ's better than FootLocker n FinishLine. Not only great selection but also great customer service
1	Stay away... This place charges more than retail.  Nike Free 5.0+ for $99 but Nike.com has the exact shoe for $79.  I will wait and have them shipped.
1	This is the worst shoe store I have ever been to. Their return policy is shady and even their corporate customer service is terrible and didn't help. I bought 3 pairs of converse shoes and since I was traveling I didn't need the boxes. The manager Timothy never said we cannot return or exchange the shoes without the boxes. That was on a Monday night. I tried the shoes at the hotel and they were a little tight. Tuesday at noon I came back to exchange them for a larger size and the assistant manager was unable to let us exchange the shoes for a larger pair (you guessed it, because we didn't have the boxes, which the manager never said would be an issue in the first place). Anyways now I'm left with 3 pairs of shoes that I cannot use. Never coming back here again.Ps. Update: the assistant manager Ricardo was very considerate and helped resolve the issue.
