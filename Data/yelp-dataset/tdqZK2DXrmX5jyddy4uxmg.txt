5	The first Thai restaurant I ever visited. The first Thai restaurant in Musselburgh - the two events strangely coincided. It was always a massive treat to go - such different flavours from what I had had before. Lemongrass since then has become a staple for me. Years on, it's still a favourite with me and has stood the test of time.
3	ooooooh a whole lot of finger shaking going on for a very sub par delivery. Congealed pad thai and just cooked vegetable cakes. What was supposed to be a mini celebration turned into a mini-meh. Not awful, but expected much much better from Lanna Thai, so much so, downgraded 2 stars as hand on heart, that was a poor show of a meal. My last meal dining in the restaurant was still fine, so am putting it down to this being a takeaway meal and hoping the standards haven't slipped that far.
4	I have recently moved into the area so keen to weed out what is good and what's just not. So far within 2 weeks we've ate here twice. Once takeaway and the second time in the restaurant. I really like this place I have to say. The food is typically very tasty. The Pad Thai is plentiful and delicious (although it was better sitting in than takeaway which I imagine is because it's fresh out of the wok). We've had a whole range of starters thus far and only one which I would say was questionable on flavour. I'd be more than happy to take future visitors to the area into this place.Although I have to say what they do on flavour they lack in service so you've been warned! This place is packed at the weekends so I would recommend booking in advance. During the week it is actually still quite busy but they seem to put on a skeleton staff which doesn't make sense!
