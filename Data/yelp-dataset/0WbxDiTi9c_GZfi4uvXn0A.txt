4	Had to check out Spencers and see what kind of BDay cards they had in. They always have the best cards. Since it was 1st thing after they opened I had the whole store to myself. I got to talking to the manager about Halloween since he was setting up a display. He was super nice and helpful and directed me to where I wanted to go.Found a perfect card and was wandering around the store checking out all the novelties & whatnot when I realized that soon enough I will not be able to go to this store with my son. He did enjoy all the flashing lights this visit but soon enough he will be asking many questions & I dont want to explain what some of the amazing products they sell there are for..at least not to soon!
4	Came in here for some bachelorette supplies and boy did I score some fun stuff! The staff that works here is super friendly and helpful. Its always fun to visit this store. They have a great selection of gag gifts for the bride to be. They were a total hit!Cant wait for the next event that brings me into the store.
4	Staff here is always super friendly. I always like wondering the store and looking at all the strange, weired, funny and sexual adult items.
4	They have so much in their store It sometimes takes a while to get through it. From Kid items (pokemon etc) to very adult themed items in the back. They are located at the Galleria Mall upstairs near the food courtVery friendly and helpful staff. I found a Minion Iphone case there and LOVE it!!!
