1	Horrible place.  I threw a party for work in Vegas and had to get some brochures printed here.  I will never use this place again.  They over charged, provided poor quality printing services and wouldn't refund us for their bad work.  These people changed out the expensive paper I asked for with cheap paper and tried to tell me that no one could tell the difference anyway.  Well, I paid for the expensive paper and I could tell the difference and so could our clients.I'll go anywhere but here in the future.
5	I've had good service from Tom at Arrowhead for years.  Good quality, service and reasonable.  He delivers to me, too.
5	Ordered some business cards in a pinch. Steve was very polite and professional in accommodating my needs. They were great with the design and the end product was exactly as promised. I would highly recommend them to anyone with any printing needs. Would definitely use again.
