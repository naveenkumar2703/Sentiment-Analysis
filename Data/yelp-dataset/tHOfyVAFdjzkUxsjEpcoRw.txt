4	It's a Dollar Store - I mean, what can you *really* expect.  It's clean and pretty well organized, and everything is a dollar.I think 2 things are important to keep in mind when you shop at a dollar store.  1) Know what things cost - not everything there is a good value, you have to know how much a gallon of bleach costs vs the quart they might be selling for a buck.  2) Know when to GET OUT.  When the poorly painted ceramic figurine of a bear with a flower sticking out of it's butt starts looking good to you, it's time to go! There's some kind of weirdness in dollar stores, you spend too much time inside, and tacky magically becomes tasteful.It's a great place to pick up cleaning staples like sponges, and I always get the aluminum pans and such for parties here.  Great seasonal item selections, right now I'm stocking up on pool toys!
4	This Dollar tree is well maintained but not one of the larger versions and doesn't have some of the items the larger stores have. I only bought three things this trip because I didn't need much and they didn't have some of the items I have bought at DT's before.  But what I got would have surely been 2-3X as much even at Wal-Mart.  In talking with the cashier, I found out this is the store that replaced the one at Az Ave and Ray when it closed.  I'm sure I'll be back because this is now the location closest to me.
