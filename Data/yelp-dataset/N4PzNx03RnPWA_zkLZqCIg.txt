2	Not worth the visit!!  There, review done. Seriously...nothing to expect here.  This indoor swap meet really had nothing to offer, at least for me.  Located between Rancho and Washington, this swap meet is small and your basic vendor type swap meet.  You can find some printed T's, jewelry, phone accessories, shoes, and luggage.  However, most of the merch are really poor quality and knock offs.  To be honest, the prices aren't even that great.  Parking is at least easy and admission is free.  I'm sure that there's something for someone here, but not something for everyone.
