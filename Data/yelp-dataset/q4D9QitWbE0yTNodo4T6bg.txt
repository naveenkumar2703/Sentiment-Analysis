5	Just great-none of this jive just listening and hoping you can apply what you learned when you get back to your computer-you'll have a computer in front of you to work on and practice on. Good teachers, smaller classes and if you need a refresher, ask about retaking the class at no charge. Also, you get the instructor's email address for questions.
4	I've been at my company for over 7 years now and without fail I have to come to ETS at least once a year for my mandatory "professional development hours".  ETS has multiple classrooms and offers of variety of training classes throughout the year (everything from public speaking to Excel to Adobe stuff). The trainers are normally very professional and to the point. Each course always comes with a full manual with screenshots that you can reference back to. They normally provide a light breakfast with coffee and sometimes even freshly baked cookies in the afternoon. The classrooms can be rented out if needed.  The bathrooms are always impeccable which is important since a lot of the classes last all day.
