3	A smallish kinda place, but they do have everything cigar. It's near by the Planet Hollywood so no worries about distance, and they're open late (midnight usually). The guy helping us was really cool, looked like a cigar smoker himself. Their selection is small, but decent and their prices are not high at all. It's great for those late late night cravings. Go and enjoy one of their $6 grabs!
1	I checked this place out mainly because of the name. It implies that either cigars are made on the premises, or there is some connection to Partagas. The first definitely isn't true and the second apparently isn't either. I found a small selection of grossly overpriced cigars (close to three times what I would pay at the cigar shops I most often frequent). They may victimize people who stay on the Strip because there aren't many other places for them to choose from, but this local will never darken their door again.
3	The place I went was on the Strip, so not sure if I have the right spot.  Had a guy rolling cigars out front.  Cool novelty.  Cigar was pretty good.  $10.I would not buy another one, but it was totally worth the $10.
1	In my personal opinion:So I called to double check this is the right place but I am not 100% sure. The place I am talking about is directly on Smith & Wollensky on the strip. Basically my husband and I were looking around and the clerk said, "can I help you?' We said, " Oh, no thank you we are just looking." then he said, "Well then why are you wasting my time?" He can go eff himself and we will not be back to waste any more of his time. Hope your smart a$$ comment is worth the 1 star review... jerk
