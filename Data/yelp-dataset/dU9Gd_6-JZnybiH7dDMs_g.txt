5	I had a great experience shopping at this Staples today.  I had a couple very specific shipping supplies I was looking for, and one of the floor reps was extremely friendly and helpful in helping me find those things.  Even a cashier at the front seemed genuinely happy to see me.  This came after a frustrating attempt to shop at Office Depot and I ended up finding the same items for about half the price.  Needless to say, I know where to shop for office supplies in Madison: Staples.
3	So Staples is located next to a Home Depot and you kind of have to know where this place is to get there. I will say that their selection is not the greatest here, it seems to be more Desks and Office chairs than anything. All the electronics are either not there or broken, but everything else is ok. Things are clean and organized and you don't have to go on a scavenger hunt for anything. Well laid out store so you don't feel pressured into other isles. Now the kicker to this place is the staff in my opinion. They are anything but helpful. Although I never asked a question or anything they were very concerned with their plans for the weekend and other work related drama when I arrived and departed. Not once did anyone ask if they could help me find something or if there was something particular I was looking for. You could here them talking and laughing from the back of the store which, i'm all for good fun at work but when you are that loud in a large store which customers are looking for something and just hear you laughing somewhere? It is a little frustrating. I didn't decide to buy anything the last few times I was here but I feel I might have if it were a little more welcoming here.
5	Whether you have printing needs or are looking for office supplies, I highly recommend this store!  EVERY SINGLE MEMBER of the staff seems to be dedicated to customer service.  I've shopped here three times since moving to Madison 2 weeks ago and every experience has been great
