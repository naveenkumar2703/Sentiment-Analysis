5	I bought a "deal of the day" coupon from the Review-Journal, thinking, what the heck?  I'll give it a go for that price.  I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful and relaxing experience.  I would have gladly paid full price and will be a return customer for sure.  Fran is gentle, knowledgeable, experienced and provides a great service in a really convenient location.
4	I would recommend this to my friends.  I was going in for surgery on Wednesday and had some stress.  My mom suggested I get a massage so immediately looked on my Groupon app.  Even though they were not massages (I know, Fran!), there were two offers that interested me and the hot oil one seemed more appealing than the facial (for your back). She worked a lot on my feet which I didn't love (sensitive feet) and then moved on to my back.  The hot oils felt great and weren't as "spicy" as she warned.  The pressure was just right.  The hot towels at the end burned but in a good way.  I did smell spicy but I didn't get any comments on my date that night, thank goodness.  I was hoping the oils would be released at my hot shower the next day but didn't feel what I hoped.  I did feel more relaxed and totally worth the $45.  If only it would last for days.
5	This is not a massage but a wonderful tool to relax and help with healing. I recently injured my sciatic nerve while moving and while I have healed for the most part, this was a wonderful way to continue my physical well being. Fran is fantastic with her energy, skill, and just a wonderful person to be around. Fran explains what reflexology is all about and it helps everyone, whether dealing with a physical problem or just wanting to feel better all over.
