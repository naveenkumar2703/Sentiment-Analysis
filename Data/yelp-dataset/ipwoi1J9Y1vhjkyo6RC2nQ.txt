5	We have been using them for about 4 years now. We only use Blaire. He's amazing. Does such a great job and really takes his time. None of this 5 minute spraying and done. Highly recommend him!!! I am wickedly afraid of any creepy crawlers and he always makes sure the problem is taken care of. :) Blaire is the best.
5	To my horror we purchased furniture on Craigslist & there were bed bugs in the recliner. Luckily after calling several pest control companies & receiving estimates & inspections, I called Senske. Their service personnel was very knowledgeable & helpful. It took several weeks & repetitive treatments but my problem is solved. I would highly recommend this company. Thank you Eric.
4	Today was our second visit from Senske.I don't remember the name of the guy who came out today and 2 months ago, but...I REALLY like this company.I hate bugs.  Any kind of bug, it really doesn't matter.  Roaches, spiders, beetles, or even crickets...no thanks!!!  They freak me out.We live in an older house, and have 5 people total living in the house, which makes having pest control SUPER affordable.  The first time he came out, he sprayed the whole house, and then did a "power spray" outside. With the exception of 3-4 dead roaches in the doorway, I haven't seen ANY bugs at all.  He came by today for maintenance, and was super nice and polite, making sure he hadn't blocked me in, as I was on my way to work.Affordable, effective, and very friendly, I highly recommend this company. :)
