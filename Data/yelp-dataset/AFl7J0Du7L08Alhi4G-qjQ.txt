4	This is the best place to get your waxing done. They even do Brazilians for only $45. It's the best price I've found anywhere in Las Vegas and their aestheticians are awesome. Haifa has been waxing me for over a year and she always does a great job.. Janet and Olivia are also great aestheticians who have been in this profession for a long long time. Will keep going there as long as I live in Las Vegas. Haven't had my hair or nails done there though, just my waxing, so that's why I give 4 stars.
1	Came Here for a consultation for my bestfriend.. The stylist we were consulting with was completely honest & amazing.. She wanted highlights in her red hair.. We decided against that.. lowlights, black or even violet.. Since it was freshly died red.. Then the owner steps in, was extremely rude & refused service because "I dont want to see you cry when you walk out bald headed.." Rudest service I have EVER seen in my life. Feel sorry for the employees.  Clean shop but we walked out b/c of the owner.

I went to Vegas to get married and my mom and sisters came from Mexico, they didn't have an appointment and foxy lady salon made everything possible for all of us to have an appointment and be ready on time...

PLUS BUDGET SUPER FRIENDLY!!! 100% recommended!!!Thanks again foxy ladies!!!RegardsNatalie Fernandez... :)
