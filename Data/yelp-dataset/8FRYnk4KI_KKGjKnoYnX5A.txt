5	So Far So GOO:D! This is the third dentist I see, He is always willing to help, to explain what the recommendation, treatment, and answer all my questions and concerns.I think that more care of health and hygiene of the patient rather than the business itself.Thanks Dr, Sandvik
5	What a great dental experience. This is a very modern and clean office. My daughter had a few teeth extracted today and I can't compliment the staff enough. Very professional, gentle, and kind. They took such good care of her, and that says a lot. I'd definitely recommend this dental office to anyone that's looking.
5	For the past 14 months, I have see Dr Sandvik at LEAST once a week, if not more for some major restoration.  I did a lot of research on dentists for my project, and also got refferals from both the oral surgeon I used, as well as the orthodontist I used, and he was the one they suggested.  I can not say enough about how happy I am with his work, his employees, and his attention to detail.  If I could show you a before and after picture, you would be shocked.  I am a complete helpless, needy person who was very stressed about the whole process, and he was flawless.  He put my fears at ease, made me do everything the right way, and not the fast way, and is a complete perfectionist.  It is so hard for me to write this review, because I could go on and on about him.  I used him for a giant, difficult, expensive (and actually I am shocked at how reasonable his pricing is for what I had done) procedure.  I also used him for all my cleanings, exams, cavities, and everything else in between.  He let me sneak in for appointments last minute, I NEVER once felt like he wasn't 100% there while I was there.  He has so much patience, and is a true professional.  He will now be my dentist for life, and I highly recommend he be yours as well.
5	The best dentist I have ever been to. Very friendly and caring! I always enjoy enjoy coming to see him .
