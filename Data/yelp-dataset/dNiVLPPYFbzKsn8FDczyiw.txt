5	I love Walgreen! It's open 24hrs and you can buy your last minute items that you forgot to bring. This Walgreen's sells the Hawaiian snacks which is a plus for me because not every Walgreen's carries the delicious snacks. If you have a cold, Walgreen's is your go to store!
1	One word: HorribleThis is the worst location ever. The staff is somewhat unprofessional but more so the location is just plain scary. Lots of late night methheads come to this place. It's rather scary shopping here so I go further up to CVS.
5	Fastest pharmacy staff!! They are so nice and quick. I love going there especially when things are on sell!
4	I like shopping here because it's a little place that offers a lot.  I don't like how it is hard to get assistance when you come late at night.
