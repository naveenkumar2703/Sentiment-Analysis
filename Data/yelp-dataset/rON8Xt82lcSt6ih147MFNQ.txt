1	I reserved a gsxr 750 a couple weeks ahead of time.  I arrived for a work trip early just to be able to ride it but was told when I arrived at my designated time that the last user "broke the chain".  I have never heard this excuse, the waiver you sign says you pay when you are rescued for mechanicals and that the operator is responsible for mechanicals.  So I am told the bike will arrive four hours late with a new chain and be available for me to ride.  It arrives only 2.5 hours late, but with a caliper leaking so bad there is actually a puddle of fluid by the left front rotor.  Please do not rent the blue gsxr, it is dangerous to ride with the reservoir completely empty, air has entered the lines and will cause complete loss of front brakes.  I did get my money back and the employees were sympathetic.  Thankfully I was not hurt.
1	Dream Car Rentals or U-Save Car rentals - one company, one miserable experience.I don't want to go into too much detail because it's a much longer story than it should be. But in brief:- Reserved a car (Cobra replica) weeks in advance for a Thursday pickup- the weekend before, called to confirm and was told the car had broken down and probably wasn't going to be available, but I should call on Monday when the mechanics were in. I had to call THEM to find this out; they didn't notify me ahead of time.- on Monday, called and was again told the car was broken and wouldn't be fixed in time. Annoying, but manageable. Cancelled the reservation.- on Wednesday, got an e-mail confirming my reservation. Called back to sort this out, spoke to someone else, and was told the car WAS ready and available, and I could pick it up Thursday.- Thursday, went to the address in the confirmation e-mail (on the Strip), ready to inspect the car and rent it if everything checked out, and THE COMPANY ISN'T AT THAT LOCATION ANYMORE. And they weren't answering their phone at 5pm on a Thursday.- Left in disgust.Summary: a complete shambles. Avoid.
