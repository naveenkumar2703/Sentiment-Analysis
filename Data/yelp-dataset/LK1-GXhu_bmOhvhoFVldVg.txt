5	We met Jill Flynn at Barktoberfest a few weeks ago in Gilbert.  She took some photos of our dogs and we were blown away at the way she captured their essence and personality, and that was just within a few minutes of snapping some photos as she was walking by.  We looked at her website and saw what she can do when you hire her to do a professional shoot of your pet, and were awestruck by her talent.  We look forward to doing some portraits of our pups with Jill.  Anyone can take a picture, it takes a special talent to capture the moment and soul of the subject.  Jill possesses that talent in spades.
5	I met Jill through an animal shelter where I volunteer.  Jill donates her time to take photos of the dogs and cats that are up for adoption - check out her work at azfriends.org - the good pictures are hers!  She also took pictures of my own dogs, Molly and Rocket.  She came to my house and set up with the big backdrop, but of course my two were afraid of the thing!  She ended up getting a really good picture of Rocket (one of my favorites) sitting in front of the backdrop.  My two got a bit scared and jumped up on the couch.  Jill's response was, "ok we can work with that" and proceeded to snap some amazing pictures of them on the couch!   While she was there she also captured pictures of my two fosters, saving me a trip of having to bring them to the shelter for photographs!If you are comparing pet photographers and are not sure who to pick, I promise you will not be disappointed with what she can do!
5	Jill Flynn is an amazing photographer!  I have AZ Prussian Snailhound Dog Rescue and her pictures really help to get our pups good homes!  She really captures their personalities in the photographs.  I highly recommend her!
