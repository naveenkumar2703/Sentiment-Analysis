I used to drive from Nellis and Boulder Highway to get there, so when I heard about there new Mr. Smog right down the street (4080 east desert inn) from me I was happy to go there and he's just has reliable but I think he's a lil quicker though.

5	The service is always second to none. They don't over charge for this service like other places. You can find coupons for this smog place as well. The best thing is they actually answer their phone.
