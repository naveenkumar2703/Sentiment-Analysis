5	We heard about Jason through a mutual friend.  Not only did we have leaking pipes out in front of our house, but one of the valves there was just about shut and sealed off water from an entire wing of our house.  Jason got right on it and repaired the broken valves we had quick.  He was great to work with and his prices were very fair.  He even gave us a one year warranty on parts and labor.Before meeting Jason, I called another (apparently highly Yelp rated) plumber about the problem of the water not working in part of the house, and I kept getting advice from them about checking the screens on the faucets or whatever.  Jason didn't give me this BS--he just solved our problem.Here's another small, local business that I can recommend to you, and I couldn't recommend it more highly.  Got a plumbing problem?  Call Jason.
