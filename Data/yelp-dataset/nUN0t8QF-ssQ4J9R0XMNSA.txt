5	We found Scott working on a neighbor's yard and we had given up our previous lawn care service a couple of months ago.   He agreed to take our yard for an initial clean up fee and a relatively low monthly fee for bi-weekly service.   Scott came out and did an awesome job on our yard.   He trimmed the front tree and got everything cleaned up great.  Scott told me had previously owned a lawn care business that he had then sold.  He regretted that and now was starting from scratch again.  He did a great job and I would recommend him to anyone.
1	I called Scott and left message that I was interested in lawn service. He never called me back.
3	I called today to see about setting up lawn service.  Scott seems like a very nice guy, and is definitely interested in taking more jobs, but heads up - he only goes as far south as Thunderbird.Gave the review three stars because I guess I thought that's neutral? =)
5	I found Scott here on Yelp.  I gave Scott a call and received a call the next day.  Scott came by the house and gave me an estimate.  Pricing was good and he started the next week.  Scott blew me away with the work he did.  My yard has never looked this good.  I'm not sure why K K never received a call back....   I know Scott takes vacation like everyone esle .... so maybe he was out and unable to contact him.. I don't know.I have had nothing but great service so far. Thanks Scott!
1	must be out of business.  The number is disconnected.  bummer.  I need a gardener.
