5	These guys are amazing. They really take care of my vehicles and offer better than new service without compromise. I can't wait to order more things from them and have them install more mods to my Camaro. They're great when it comes to pricing, communication and they do some great quality work. I definitely recommend them!
5	Wow, awesome goodies for your ride, if you want to stand out from the crowd buy from Alon, he will make your ride shine!
1	Horrible customer service!  Honestly my worst online experience ever!  Their pictures don't match the product you receive and then charge you a ridiculously high restocking fee to return.  There are plenty of other better companies to choose.  Save your time and money with this one
