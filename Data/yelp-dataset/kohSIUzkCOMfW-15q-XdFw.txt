3	OK, I'll fess up.   Jack in the Box is one of my favorite fast food places to grab a quick burger.  This location is between my shop and my bank so I would venture to say I have been here at least 30 times in the last 17 years.  Being in downtown it is always a surprise what you will find going on.  Quite often there will will a police action going on in the parking lot or the dining room which shuts the place down.  It has recently been the scene of a dining room remodel going on throughout the chain which includes high top tables.Today I chose the grilled pastrami sandwich by itself to take out.  It isn't too bad and has been reviewed well by those that track fast food stuff.  Today's drama was the woman working the counter with her family eating in the dining room and she had to borrow a buck from her daughter so she could have something to eat on her break.
3	Just like any other jack in a box. Ehh food drive thru has been fast. No real complaints.
1	I don't usually do fast food but today I was in a hurry between work and upcoming move I just didn't have time so I hit this Jack.  I ordered a spicy chicken with extra, extra mayo.  Got back to work and there was absolutely NO mayo on this dried up chicken sandwich.  I called them and got no satisfaction, as person that answered the phone acted like she couldn't hear me (there was some background noise) and actually hung up on me!!  No more Jack for this girl.  I'm done!
