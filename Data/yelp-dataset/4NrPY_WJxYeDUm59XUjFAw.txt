4	Free wifi. It was pretty clean, even the restroom. They use the card system here. It was $1.99 for the double load washers and $0.30 for the dryers. I wish the dryers were free like some other places though. Come early when it's empty!
3	You use the card here, and it is free.....BUT....the cheapest washer is $1.99 and it is for a very small load. The next size is up is the size of washer that most people would have at home..that was $3.99. Dryers are 30 cents for 8 minutes. I payed almost $20 to the equivalent to 6 loads of laundry in a residential washer...OUCH!!!!Place was super clean and the staff was very helpful. You can also use your visa/mastercard here.
4	The only one in Avondale I'll go to!Clean.  Friendly, helpful staff, tvs, vending machines
4	Very clean. Great Customer Service!  Great,  clean restrooms!  It gets busy, but that's expected for a clean, large place. You pay for convenience and cleanliness!
5	The laundry service is pricey @1.00 a pound, but they did an excellent job! Laundry smelled wonderful, was wrinkle free, folded neatly, hung neatly, and done promptly! If I could afford it, I'd use it regularly!
