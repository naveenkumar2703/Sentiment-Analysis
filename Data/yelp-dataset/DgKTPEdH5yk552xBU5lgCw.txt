2	I love rocky's pizza.  This place is fun for kids as it has an arcade.  It also has 100 soda flavors.  Now, for the not so good, floors were very dirty with wrappers etc.  There were numerous empty tables needing to be cleared.  Seemed understaffed for a weekend.
3	great place for kids!
4	If Chuck-e-Cheese is the Kids' alternative to Vegas, then this place is the poor kids' alternative to Vegas on the East side. But the pizza is awesome, and the token-to-ticket pay out ratio on the games is great. Also, the mascot of an Italian pizza baron beats an animated mouse who prepares your food any day. Just remember to share the games with the poor East-side kids who couldn't get a ride over to Chuck's.
3	If I didn't have kids I would never go to this location. I like Rocky's pizza, and I really like the breadsticks, but this place is nuts. It has the arcade games and weird smorgasbord pop machine and LOTS OF NOISE. The last time we were there the salad bar was completely picked-over and one pop machine wasn't dispensing ice. But the woman at the register (a manager) knew her stuff so had us get the kid's meals instead of going ala carte. My kids *love* going here for the games (and cheap prizes), and one of my sons attended a birthday party last spring (in the theatre room) and had a fantastic time. Rocky's does have beer, which gets a giant thumbs up from me. I'd give the place 2 stars for the last visit, but every other time we've gone it has been a solid 3 stars, so I'm going with the average.
1	The staff seems to enjoy talking to each other rather then help customers.  The place seems more like a Chucky Cheese than a really Rockys.  I go out of my and go to the Monona Drive location.  They seem to be the friendliest and best quality.
