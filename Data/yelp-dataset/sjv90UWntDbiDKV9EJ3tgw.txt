3	I've been a member here for almost a year. What works well s there are machines galore? What doesn't work for me is that the washrooms look unattended many times ( garbage overflowing, wet counters and a bit dirty).  Also on several occasions the steam room seems out of service. You pay a decent amount for a membership. Maybe my expectations are too high, but I expect to get my money's worth which I question at times!
2	I wanted to start by saying that I'm from south Florida where the're are gyms on every corner, and have been a member of Gold's sister company World's Gym for many years. First and foremost this Gym is by far leaps and bounds more equipped and modern than the World's and even the Gold's Gym my friend was a member of. However, the pricing of this gym is outrageous as well as insulting. At one point in my life I was a member of an equivalent gym in equipment and appeal and was paying half the price. The membership of the said gym came with the use of a full size basketball court, racquetball, and an Olympic swimming pool. Fact is, with all of the amenities combined do you really think you will use them enough to pay such a high premium -- coming from someone that has been going to the gym off and on for 12 years now I would say NO.  Wether I was being jerked around by the price or it is correct that people actually pay what was quoted to me, I would expect this place to offer more than they so righteously bolster in the first place, and never have an issue of upkeep -- as I have read in  a previous post.
