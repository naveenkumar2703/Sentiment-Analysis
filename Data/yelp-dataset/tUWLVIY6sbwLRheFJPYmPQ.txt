5	A must when you visit the Heard.   The staff is very professional.     James, Lora and Allison are excellent.     The shop is first class.   Great place for a collector.      Some of the finest Native American art available.          Highly recommend a visit.       You will be amazed.
5	I love this store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!we recently lost a very dear/sentimental Carol Suina storyteller doll that was extremely hard to find (single child- trust me, they are not a dime a dozen).  I checked the Heard Museum online store & they had other pieces by the artist, but not the storyteller I was looking for, so I emailed them.  Within 24 hours they tracked down another one in a similar style by an artist from the same tribe. when I sent that e-mail it was a total "shot in the dark" & I figured I'd be SOL. Jewel went out of her way to find a piece she thought I would like.... & she was totally right.AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE & KNOWLEDGEABLE STAFF.  if I could give 6 stars, I would!
3	There are actually two shops here at the Heard, one for books and food items and another for jewelry and collectibles.  Both are great.When we come to the Heard, either here or in way North Scottsdale, we find we can never leave without a purchase or two.  Granted the jewelry case is much harder to resist.  But, most of the jewelry items are similar to those found elsewhere, such as in Old Town Scottsdale.  It's a matter of price and what catches your eye.As I mentioned above, the other Museum shop is filled with books and food items for the home, or to send away to family members as gifts for birthdays and the Holidays.  Recently we were here with an out of town relative and must of picked the close-out book section clean.Enjoy!
4	I love the huge collection of their Kachina dolls.They have authentic dolls from Hopi tribe. They have a section of items on sale and you may find a great deal for a beautiful art piece! I personally found a great piece by Lauren Honyouti which was originally priced for $2200 for $600.
