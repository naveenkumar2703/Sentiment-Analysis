2	Pretty standard FedEx place. Staff seemed a little put out I was there wanting to ship something.  Eh. Sorry I made you work.
2	Well on a recommendation I tried this center to see if my experience would be better than the last visit FedEx office.   Well the store was clean & the copies were good but the compliment ends there.   I had 2 different people assist me, one which appeared to be the manager seemed very pushy, rushed, & stressed.  It might be that she was having a bad day or what not.  Then the other person just seemed impatient.   There is a pattern forming here & it is not good for business. The transaction would run allot smoother if just stick to the service we are asking for.  There is something wrong with the way that this company treats their customers.  It is unprofessional to be talked down and being talked to like a 5th grader.  Second trying to being convinced to buy additional products when we just want 1 service which is copies is very annoying.  The direction of the company from what i see isn't very good - the rapport is coming  from FedEx Office is that the employees are very pushy, mildly bitchy, not well trained. .  I will not be back to this location unless it it is an absolute last resort.
