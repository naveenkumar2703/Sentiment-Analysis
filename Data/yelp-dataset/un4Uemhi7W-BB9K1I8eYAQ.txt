4	While still on my quest for the best cupcakes in town and I stumble across this place while walking Meadows Mall, and it's great! Moist, tasty cupcakes from a small homegrown company making their way from a tiny little stall in the mall. Amazing and cheap at about $2.50/cupcake (we had mini cupcakes on the strip that cost more)! We tried the strawberry cream cheese and red velvet, both moist and yummy. To give the full 5 stars the red velvet would need a tad more chocolate flavor and a smidge more frosting-- but overall I would definitely visit this place again and I'm looking forward to trying other flavors.
4	Located in Meadows Mall, upstairs in the food court, Cupcake Cafe caught my eye. Overall, the cupcakes were pretty good! It's about $2.49 for a babycake (regular size cupcake), and $3.95 for a King Size cupcake (a really tall cupcake, about two cupcakes in one). So I take my first bite of the strawberry shortcake which is white cake with strawberry frosting. The cake was moist and the frosting was okay just a little too much for me. I also ordered the red velvet, it was good! But the only downfall I can say about this place is the paper bags they put it in if you get it togo. Pretty much the cupcakes get all messed up! I sure hope they get some togo containers like every other cupcake place.
5	I had the Vanilla Babycake with Vanilla Creamy Icing and Coconut. It was the best cupcake I have ever had. You must have a cupcake from here. Or you will miss out!
