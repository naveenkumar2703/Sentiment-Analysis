5	One of the best shops around. It's a family-owned business that's been around forever (close to fifty years). I've been going to Duaine's for a dozen years. I won't go anywhere else. They aren't cheap, but they won't rip you off. They do great work at a reasonable price. Regardless of where you live in the valley, Duaine's is worth the trip. Go see Bob and his crew. You won't be disappointed.
5	This is the only place I take my car outside of pesky recall notices; been a customer for years.  Reason:  they called to tell me once that a part they had ordered was actually the wrong one and that a new one was on its way and cheaper than the first.  They had no reason/need to call me with this information and could have easily charged me for the higher-priced part as I wasn't aware (and wasn't there waiting on the vehicle).  They also frequently tell me I do not require a service at the time the manufacturer recommends, saving me money (this latest trip,  they told me my brakes were still at 80% -- no need to do anything with them).  They recently refurbished their waiting room (so that they now, um, have one) but it has no TV or wifi or comfortable chairs (though these upgrades may be coming -- didn't ask).  Better to be prepared to drop your car off either the night before or at opening at 7 am and return upon notification that it's ready.  The service and price are worth the scheduling dilemma!  Also worth the longer drive if you're not a Henderson-ite.  I live in south Vegas and happily make the trek knowing I'm going to a trustworthy business.Side note:  They also service electric cars (both major-manufacturer and converted).
5	I've been coming here for at least 19 years it's the only place I ever take my car. They are very trustworthy and will do anything to help you. They better never go out of business. I would be lost without them.
