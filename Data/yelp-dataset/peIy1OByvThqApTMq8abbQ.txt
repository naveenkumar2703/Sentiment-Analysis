2	I went here to get realigned a couple of months ago. The staff was very nice and my actual appointment went quite well. When it came time to reschedule for a follow up appointment, I was thoroughly disappointed. I scheduled the second appointment the day I went in to see them. Days later, I received an email asking to reschedule because the doctor was out sick. No big deal, I replied to the email to set another time. A little after that, I got a phone call confirming my appointment for the time I was just asked to reschedule. I called the office and the person who answered seemed baffled. This exact thing happened again with my second rescheduled appointment. After that experience, I had a lack of confidence in the office and have not gone back.
