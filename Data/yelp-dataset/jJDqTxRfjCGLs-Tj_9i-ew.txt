4	The Christmas Goose Quilt shop was the second stop on my visit to the Las Vegas quilt shops. This shop had a very charming, country feel to it throughout the store. There were many, many samples of small projects mixed in with the bolts of fabric, as well as wall hanging kits and large quilts hanging on the wall. The Christmas Goose offers several ways to save in their store throughout the month, including 30% off on the 30th of the month, a Birthday Club and Fat Quarter Fridays. Check out their website for more details and more special offers.
4	The Christmas Goose is a lovely little shop on the westside. I love the employees who are all very endearing. They have a great selection of civil war, reproduction, and country fabric. My only dislike is the lack of unique, bright colored fabric, but that is my personal taste. It is worth a drive across town.
5	A great quilt shop!  They serve hot apple cider during the winter months.  Very helpful employees and a vast selection of Civil War and Kansas Troubles fabrics.  Great shop for making a folk art quilt.
5	This shop is lovely! If you are looking for Civil War reproduction fabrics this is the place to find them. Their selection is HUGE. The employees are sweet and very helpful.
