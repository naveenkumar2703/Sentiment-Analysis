4	This is a hidden off-Strip treasure. The Frutti di Mare is one of the best renditions I've ever tasted, though it fluctuates a bit from spectacular to just very good. But it's hit spectacular more often than not.  The Ahi Elchico is another standout. I eat here often. I bring out of town guests here often. Lunch is a bargain. The bread is a waste of time and the only thing that consistently disappoints me here. But still...highly recommended and the prices are very reasonable.
3	I was surprised that entry was through the bar area and no one was staffing the hostess station.  On entering the restaurant proper we were directed to wait in the bar area until someone could seat us.  The place is attractive, but neither upscale nor particularly intimate though we required a flashlight to read the menus.   We shared a full size house salad that was described as field greens tossed walnuts, gorgonzola cheese, onions, carrots and berries in apple pear dressing.  The salad was very good even though the gorgonzola was MIA and the berries were represented by 2 slices of strawberry.  My wife's entre of spinach lasagna in a tomato vodka sauce was prepared with fresh pasta and was melt in your mouth delicious.  I chose the penne alla Dean Martin - a thick pink vodka sauce with peas, chicken and prosciutto served in a martini glass.  Just kidding about the glass, but there is an appetizer on the menu called a lobster martini that is served in 2 martini glasses. Overall the food was better than average though very pricey.
4	I love going to Marc's for lunch because they have an out of this world tomato soup which is made with super sweet tear drop tomatoes and served with mini grilled cheese sandwiches.   They also offer delicious salads.   Dinner is nice as well but lunch is a bargain in comparison.
