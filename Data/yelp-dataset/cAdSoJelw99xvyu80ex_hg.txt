5	This is simply a quick healthy lunch spot!  I always enjoy great service and fresh ingredients on my salad or sandwich.  One time they even threw out the lettuce that was in the bin on the counter because they didn't want to serve it to me,  I appreciate attention to detail on things like that!If you need a quick inexpensive sandwich/salad shop this is it!
5	for the record this place is so much better than subway!i love the meat and cheese.  not alot of veggies to choose from but that is okay.  the sandwich as a whole is freakin good.the sides are good but a little pricey.  now i'm hungry again.
3	Really good subs! The macaroni salad is good too. Just don't visit this location any later than an hour or so before closing. They tend to start their cleaning very early, and they're very loud about it.
5	The sandwiches are so good!  That good-quality, fresh-sliced meat makes the difference.  I always, always have to get one on sourdough, it's the best.  I never have to wait long for my food because they always whip it up quick, and the prices are pretty decent.If i were to recommend a sub, it would be either the #1 with ham, salami, capicolla, pepperoni & provolone on sourdough or the #18 with roast beef, turkey & provolone on sourdough.  Top either one off with the mustard/mayo mix & plenty of veggies and don't talk, just eat.  In the meantime, get yourself one of those fresh-baked cookies.  They are BOMB.
5	My coworker and I got to this place all the time for lunch. They make our food super fast and our food is always delicious
2	Subs were ok. Employees were not very friendly. It was clean but I will not be coming back.
