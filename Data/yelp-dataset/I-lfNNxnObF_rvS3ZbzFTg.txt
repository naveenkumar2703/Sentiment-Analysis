4	This Circle K Just opened, and it is definately a valuable asset to this area.  Gantzel Farms store no longer has a monoply, and local competition in the conveniance store department is always a good thing.Everything is new, so the store is obviously nice - Bathroom is clean, staff is friendly.VERY busy, since it is new - A bit of a wait each time I am there, but the low prices make up for it.
5	So glad that Circle K came to our area. I fill up here at least once a week. I am happy to see many others doing the same. The Chevron across the street has been raping us out here for years, so I am happy to give someone else my business.
5	Thank goodness for this new Circle K!The other 2 were filthy and disgusting and management would not do anything about it. I complained about the one on Hunt Hwy so many times. There is slime on the ice dispensers. It is so gross!Also, nice to see that the Chevron has a little competition.
2	Have been back to this Circle-K numerous times since my initial review, and I must say that it has really gone downhill fast!  Very slow service, constant waits, and pretty dirty-looking countertops, food area, etc.  Staffing always seems minimal, and I think this explains all of the above.  Now this is just another Circle-K.....Go to Gantzel Farms Country Store across the street for better service, cleaner facilities, and similar pricing.
5	This is my favorite circle k. They are much cleaner than the other two in San Tan Valley/Queen Creek. Their sodas also taste better. I know that sounds weird but it's like the carbonation is stronger because they have newer soda machines compared to the older circle k's.
