4	This review is based on take out service only. I've had food from Steakout 5 or 6 times so far and each time my husband picked up the food so I haven't actually stepped inside the restaurant. My husband did tell me that the place was clean inside. Food - so far we have tried the Cheese Steaks, Fish and Chips and Chicken WIngs. For take out food it is really good. I especially liked the honey barbecue chicken wings, great flavor and just the right amount of sauce. Very reasonably priced. Location - The restaurant is tucked away in Athem near Vons which is great for us since its 5 minutes away from home. If you live in Anthem you'll understand how great this is since there's not too many choices that close. If you like Cheese Steaks I'd say give this place a try.
5	Although this is a chain restuarant, their name is correct. I have only gotten beef and chicken cheese steaks (variety of cheeses) and fries here. Their cheesesteaks are some of the most authentic I have tasted. They feature ribeye steak your choice of cheese (yea, they have cheese wiz if that's your deal). The icing one the steak is that they feature Amoroso's bread which is the official Philly Cheesesteak roll and without which you can't have an authentic cheesesteak. This location is in a weird location almost into Anthem at the back of a shopping center, but worth the trip if you are around Eastern and St. Rose area.
1	This place needs to figure out how to run a safe and efficient food business. I went on to pick up two cheesesteaks for takeout and waited close to 35 minutes. There were two people working - no other customers. The one at the register kept going back to help the cook - neither was wearing gloves when handling the food directly. When we opened the sandwiches at home, the beef and chicken looked like jerky. A 35 minute cook time will probably do it. What a waste of money. Go down the street for Capriotti's if you want a good sandwich.
