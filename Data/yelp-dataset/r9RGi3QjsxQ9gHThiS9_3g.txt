4	This isn't the very best in town as there are better cash converters in the worse retail spots on the outskirts of town which don't get the same number of visitors, but this is the very best of its kind this close to town.It's not exactly in the city centre, but Leith Walk is a popular shopping street so you can come here and still have a browse about in all the other shops.  For any electrical equipment these places are hard to beat and this place's speciality it its hi-fi and audio section which offers fabulous value for money especially on any item that plays CDs making it ideal for those with an impressive CD collection.Other than electrics it only offers a few musical instruments and golf clubs, but it really doesn't matter because it does do electrics very well.
1	Dreadful--if you want a full and honest refund for an item that does not work--buy from somewhere else--DO NOT BUY FROM HERE!!!!.The store manager here will do everything and anything not to refund on an item that does not work!!!!
1	No refund on items that are not working--the store manager will do everything and anything not to give a refund.Go somewhere else for an honest deal.
