5	I've utilized Kristena Malgren's CPA services to compile my tax return forms for the past 2 years. Kristena has been a pleasure to work with, is always willing to research and answer questions and has very affordable rates. I'd highly recommend her for all your tax preparation and other accountant needs.

5	Kristena was recommended to us by another CPA.  From my first phone call to her through the completion of our 2013 taxes, I have enjoyed every conversation with her.  The comments and suggestions from her on my "less than usual" tax return were thorough and professional.  I am very satisified on the preparation time and documents prepared.  With this service, Kristena can expect my business for a long time.
