5	Most awesome cruise I have ever been on. There was plenty of micro brews and superb food. The whole boat seemed to have the time of their life including our party of people. I could easily say that it was the best three hours I have ever spent in Lake Las Vegas. I would recommend anybody to go on it.
5	A cruise aboard a beautiful boat full of local beers, beautiful people, and killer BBQ. How could you not have a good time on the cruise? I have to say that I really enjoyed myself aboard the brews cruise. The event host were awesome and were making sure that everyone was having a good time. When they come back to do the next cruise, I will make sure that my girlfriends and I are gonna be on it.
1	It's not a yacht...it's more like a hot box bastardized pontoon boat. Beer was nothing spectacular but the food was good (mainly just the spirit infused cocktails). Too many frat kids on this boat...
