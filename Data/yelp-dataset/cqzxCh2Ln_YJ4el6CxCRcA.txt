4	I haven't yet visited this park, but know the guy who helped design it, and have heard from several fans that this is beautiful...except...swayed by outspoken BMXers, the city allowed bikes at the park. old fashioned BMX and skate rivalries aside, it's just a dumb idea. why spend all this city money to build a beautiful new skatepark and then allow equipment that's just going to tear it all up? it opened in january and was already closed for repairs in february. dumb, dumb dumb.they tried alloting specific days and hours to either skaters or bikers, and i can imagine how well that went over. they've issued a ban on bike pegs, but who is enforcing that is anybody's guess.my guess is that they'll eventually ban bikes, for safety reasons (bikes go waaay faster and can cause much more brutal accidents) and damage, but who knows when.p.s., like every outdoor skate park in az, it's free, of course. pads and helmets are "strongly recommended" but not required... so when that bike hits that six year old at top speed, his head can crack open like melon - makes sense.
5	best frigging' park in town ! if you want big transitions, pool coping, cradles, & hauling ass then you should check this place out. Killer fucking pro bowl that hits the 12 foot high range in the deep end. Front-side grinds feel the best hitting' the pool coping & clicking over the tiles. No way is there any other park in the greater Phoenix area that even compares to this. Pad nannies are no longer employed at the park due to budget cuts, but knee pads will save your ass.
5	Great park. Great police presence. Helmets are required. You will be kicked out without one. No bikes or scooters allowed. Closes at 9pm on Sunday's.
