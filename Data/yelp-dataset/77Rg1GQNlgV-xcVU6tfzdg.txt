1	went through the drive thru, didn't speak English very well. Took my order knowing fully well that they were out of the type of chicken I ordered. Very rude! I will NOT be returning to this location on my next Vegas visit!
3	I only come here for the occasional two-for-Tuesday special. The service is standard for a chain and I never have any issues with having to wait too long for my order or them running out. Overall, I have a satisfactory experience typically.
4	I think out of all the locations I have been to, this one is my favorite. And it didn't used to be this way. Trust.Employees are definitely up to par and service is very standard. Wait times are short and food is always fresh and hot. I normally come on Tuesday to catch their $0.99 special and in between the hours of 11-1230 as it almost 100% guarantees that I will have super fresh chicken.The only downside is that the tables are not cleaned fast enough when they are busy.
2	First night in Las Vegas. Decided to go with a familiar favorite from back home but not all locations are the same quality. This location seems to be struggling.  Chicken is just ok compared to the quality of Popeye's back home. Pass on the corn which was inedible
4	good deals great chicken
