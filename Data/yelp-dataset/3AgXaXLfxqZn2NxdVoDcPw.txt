2	Strangest jersey mikes i have been to. All the employees shout at the top of their lungs- I almost went deaf from hearing DO YOU WANT MIKE'S WAY?!!!!! Over and over. The food tastes just like every other jersey mikes so I don't know what they are screaming about.

4	Great fast service, and the employees were friendly. I ordered a Philly cheesesteak with jalapenos and it was made within a few minutes and was streaming hot and delicious. I can't wait to come back and try another sandwich
