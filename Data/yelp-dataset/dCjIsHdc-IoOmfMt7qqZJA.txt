4	I was headed out for Mexican food but had a hot & sour soup attack at the last minute, so I whipped over here to give this buffet a try.It's a very large place, & I was greeted inside by a friendly host & a good selection of about 60 food items out, plus a Mongolian BBQ off to the side.  On my way to the hot & sour soup, I got sidetracked first by a shrimp cocktail (Yum!), then a tossed salad with cream on it (Yum!) & some other treats.  I was up to 4-Stars for the place before I even got to what I came for.  Of course the h&s soup was good , & there were three other soups to choose from, also.  Great Egg Foo Young, General Tso Chicken that he would come over here from China to get, great meatballs in a garlic sauce, the best fried chicken in Phoenix... you get the idea.The look of this place, besides large, is that it has some miles on it, but it's not run down.  (There were probably 100 other diners there with me in the afternoon.  Imagine how many people a year this place must serve!).  There are zillions of plants around the place, & it's kind of divided up so it doesn't look like a warehouse.  I found it completely comfortable, & the food tables are spread around enough that you don't bump elbows much with the other customers.Since I couldn't find anything but great food at the steam tables, I waddled over to the genuine, round Mongolian BBQ to fill my bowl with goodies (lamb!), & place my order for exactly how I wanted it to taste & see what happens.  The (very nice) chef there put a lot of different seasonings in, checking with me along the way, & cooked it up.  It was terrific.$6.99 Weekdays, $9.19 Weekends, drink included.  Seniors 10% off.=====================================================9/24/09 Update:I stopped back into this big, comfortable place for lunch today to see how they're holding up against the ultra-popular new Lin's, nearby.Well, they've dropped the price here down to $5.99/5.40 Senior, in response to the new competition.  Even so, the lunch crowd here has thinned down a lot.  That's too bad, because the food is still delicious, particularly their Mongolian Barbecue, & this place is a shrimp lover's delight!If you don't need a fancy ceiling, stop in here, save a couple of bucks, & support a good LOCALLY OWNED business that's trying hard to survive!PS:  I read the other review... I think the Hot & Sour Soup here is excellent!
1	Huge place with comfortable seating.  That's all the positive things I can think to say about it.  My fiance stopped eating halfway through his plate for fear that he'd be sick if he continued.  I soldiered through, because I had been craving chinese buffet all day.  I took a sip of the hot and sour soup and could barely even recognize what I was tasting.  It was just WEIRD.  The orange chicken and sesame chicken weren't too bad, but just about everything else was too dried out (we were there at 6 so it should have been fresh), or was overloaded with large pieces of onion.  Someone got lazy with the chopping, I guess.  We didn't try the mongolian bbq.  Maybe that would have been okay, but we'll never know, because we won't be going back.
2	I took takeout so my review will be somewhat limited. First impression ... you come in and the place looks tired. Not bad, but kind of like "I wish you would go away so I can rest" tired. Wouldn't want to actually eat there, but for the 10 minutes it took it was ok. Didn't try Mongolian but it looked ok.Can't beat the takeout. $6.99 (takeout or reinstated price?) for a 3 section styrofoam box that you can fill to your little heart's content. As long as the lid can close comfortably ... there is a sign to this effect.The buffet was average. I stuck to the appetizer-type stuff and filled it up. Ultimately it was enough for 2 or 3 meals. Not bad for a set price. However, if you're craving quality Chinese, this is not it. Not by a long shot. Good for a day when you're not picky about taste (not bad, mind you) or content.Takeout also came with a container for soup. The hot and sour did look awesome, with large chunks of tofu, and it was one of the better ones I have tried. Upon request, the attendant also filled a large bag of crispy noodles for me to take along. They did have little cups for sauces, but the hot mustard looked plastic and congealed. Scary to eat, scary to taste so I left it there. And there was no plum sauce to mix it with.  I was surprised that they didn't have a regular menu also, but all buffet, all the time ... will I go again ? one of life's questions, yet to be answered. And asked ...
3	This used to be my spot for filling up on cheap Chinese. It's got a small variety of dishes, mostly some variation of chicken. Not the best, but kudos to them for the terriyaki chicken on skewers. It's amazing and no other buffet does it as well.Most importantly, there's a Mongolian grill. Have fun mixing beef, chicken, or shrimp with your choice of vegetables, noodles, and sauces. I love mixing the minced garlic with cooking wine, but maybe I'm just weird like that. Try it anyways.Minus one star for going a bit downhill over the years...only soda/tea as beverages. I missed the guava punch, or even the cheap orange juice from concentrate. It was refreshing. Also, I'm cross with them for no longer having pork or lamb (imagine all you can eat lamb cooked to your order!), so I don't think I can get excited anymore.Still though...I just can't give 2 stars to a place with a Mongolian Grill. Chinese Gourmet is a-ok with me!
4	Sadly, this excellent buffet has closed!     :-(
3	I had lunch here with Rand H. I started with the Mexican soup which was very good for a Chinese buffet. The main dishes were all OK ,with nothing really screaming YUMMMM. but the grand re opening special of $4.99 it was a great value. To many better Chinese buffets close by. I think they will struggle here.I give them 6 months and it will close again.
3	= = = = = = CLOSED = = = = = =So sad, so sad!  This completely ok Buffet has folded again.     :-(The food, the staff, the comfort & the prices were all fine here.  There was just too much Buffet competition, especially Chinese Buffet competition, in the immediate area for them to get enough business to survive.  I'll miss them (unless & until they open for a 3rd time!).     :-)
