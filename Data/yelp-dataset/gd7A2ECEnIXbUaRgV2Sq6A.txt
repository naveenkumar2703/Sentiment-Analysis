5	I had a few other companies come out and give estimates on our place and they were all 2-3 hours late with no phone call. M3 was on time which already made me like them better. Everyone I talked to on the phone was SUPER nice and helpful. We ended up going with them to do the work and it looks GREAT! They were on time this morning to do the work, they cleaned up after themselves, and were very courteous about the noise. Most of the work was done in the bathroom and they had the door shut the whole time so it wasn't that loud in our house. I definitely recommend and will be using them again if we need anything else done! ( KNC contracting and Capstone group were the 2 companies with terrible customer service)
1	Was on time.  Seemed knowledgeable.  Gave some good ideas for what I wanted done.  Called back later in the week since I still hadn't even received a bid.  They said they would get back to me.  Never heard from them again.  I really don't like people wasting my time.  They could've at least called and said they couldn't/wouldn't do the job.
