5	My dog peed on their carpet...And they were completely calm and professional about it.  I came in to refinance my house and had great friendly service even for a huge banking institution.  They even had doggy treats as well.  Ultimately there is nothing they had to offer for homes for refinancing, but they were very friendly.  The building has a very interesting modern look which is not typical of a banking institution.
3	This branch sits at a very busy intersections on the SWC of Tatum Blvd. & Shea Blvd. in Paradise Valley.  The lobby is very big and very bright, floor is very shiny.  And yet, on a busy Friday afternoon during lunch, there were a lot of personal bankers and yet there were only 2 tellers helping you at the lobby and at the drive-thru.  The branch has 3 drive-thru lanes, 2 for ATM's and 1 with window teller.  There are 2 separate teller ATM's for after-hour business from a separate entrance where you have to use your Bank of America Debit card for entry.  Overall service was okay, but I waited for about 10 minutes before I was helped.  Not coming here again if I don't need to.
4	Great service each and every time!!      This place is great when you need to, make changes to your account, have a cashier's check issued or simply need a large or out of the ordinary withdrawal.The service is great, which makes up for their understaffed team. Everyone and the manager have a great attitude and are very willing to help. Not the bank I frequent, but definitely helpful since its the closest to home!!
