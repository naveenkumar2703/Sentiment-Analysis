1	Just hope your ID is not compromised with this bank. They alerted me to an ATM fraud with their own system, then denied my claim because they could not figure out how it was compromised. Essentially accusing me of theft. The amount of the ATM withdrawal was $502.50 by some thief at the Longhorn Casino. They were no help with video record either. As a result of this fiasco I closed my savings with WAMU exceeding $50,000. Your money is not safe with WAMU or Chase.
4	i normally really like this bank. every time i go in there is no one in there so i never have to wait. so as far as banks go i really like it its quick and easy to pay my bills.
