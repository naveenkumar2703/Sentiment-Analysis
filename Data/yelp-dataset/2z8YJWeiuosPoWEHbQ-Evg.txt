4	Great clean gas station. Perfect for stopping on the way between Tucson and Phoenix. They had Dt. Dr. Pepper in the soda fountain which I thoroughly enjoyed.
3	Not bad.
5	This is my stop when I'm rocking the 10 east or west when traveling to Tucson. Nice clean restrooms and they have a ton of drink and munchie options. There's plenty of places to gas up as well.
