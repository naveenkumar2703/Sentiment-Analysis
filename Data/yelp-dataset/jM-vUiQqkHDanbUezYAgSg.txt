5	Noodle Express has your regular, generic, Americanized menu of the same old Chinese food you get anywhere.   I gave them 5 stars because their buffet is extraordinary REAL Chinese food.  Call first; I think the buffet's only on weekends for dinner.  I stopped in yesterday for the first day of the buffet and everything was amazing.  Mussels were fresh, delicious, and cooked perfectly, not a spec of sand any where, no old fishy taste.  My wife asked about the crab and the lady said, "It's walking, and you chop it, and you cook it."   The duck was so tender it melted like butter.  The beef stomach was wonderful, soft and tender.  There were some tamer options on the buffet  that were still good like pork sausage in egg, but if you're afraid of real food there's always the generic Chinese Menu.There were things that I couldn't tell if were animal, vegetable, or fungus; all I know is that they were delicious.  The staff didn't speak very good English, so it was difficult to find out what everything was.  I really hope they keep/expand the buffet because the only way I'm going to get real Chinese food this good is if I travel to China.
5	This place is really authentic Chinese style. Strongly recommended for people who love Chinese cuisine. They even have hot pot from Mon-Thur. Will try next time
5	Decent chinese food!! I was recommended by my friends, I was lost at the first time due to the not obvious sign. But the food is great!! I would strong recommend you to try it out. Price is also reasonable.
