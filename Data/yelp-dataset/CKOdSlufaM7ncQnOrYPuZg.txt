5	We are restoring a 1962 Shasta Travel Trailer, and I took it here to have the bearings in the axle repacked and sealed, for long excursions, and just because it's so old. Extremely friendly & knowledgeable service people, very trustworthy and thorough. My bearing have an older type seal, and rather than putting the old one back on they searched around town for the new, old style, to do the job correctly. Seems they work on anything as well, from giant, 300-thousand dollar motorhomes to travel trailers, campers, pop-ups, etc.
1	A part here cost me $24. Found same part at Home Depot for $8. Won't be back!
4	I popped into this place one Monday morning without being on the schedule.  They happily took me in, despite my failure to plan.  Gold Star!  I was truly grateful.  I own a pop-up, but know nothing about what it takes to maintain them.  Probably not the best idea I've ever had...but definitely feel more at east with Bell Road RV on my side.  They fixed it right up at a pretty good price and I was on my way up north by the weekend.  Four stars only because when I picked it up, the three parts guys sitting at the counter didn't offer to come out and assist in backing me up or hooking up my trailer.  I was in heels and a dress too, guess they figured it was too hot outside to move.  I don't blame them.  Will definitely be back if I need any other repairs, which I hope isn't too soon.  Thank you!
