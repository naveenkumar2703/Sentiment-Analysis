4	Someone sent a box of these cookies to my office! Whoever that person was they are my new best friend. These are some of the best cookies i have ever had. They are great! I especially recommend the peanut butter cookies. I am not sure if you can get them locally or if they have to be delivered . But the delivery charge is well worth it. http://www.selmas.com/
5	They sell these at the It's a Grind on Polk.1 star credit goes to the lovely employees who offer to warm up my cookie, enhancing the cookie experience. If you don't warm it up it may not be the same...I love the white chocolate chip cookie. - its white chocolate, soft cookie, tofee -  It's sometimes my breakfast. this is 5 starsI hate chocolate chip cookies with no cookie, all chocolate - and theirs is a lot of chocolate. so I give that cookie a 3.635 star because the chocolate isn't too sweet.white chocolate raspberry - yummy as well - 4 stars.I wish they weren't $2.10. But I never finish the whole thing (LIAR ALERT when it comes the the white chocolate cookie). Ok, most of the time, but they are big and chunky and good to share.
4	Today I stopped for Bagels. Selma's is next door so to make it a completely carbo-riffic day it made sense to get one of these ginormous cookies. I like these kinds of places it's all industrial looking and almost like some sort of cookie sweat shop.  Kind of expensive for a cookie but well worth it for this belly bomber.
