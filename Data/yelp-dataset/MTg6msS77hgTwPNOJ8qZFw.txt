3	This is where my indoor soccer teams plays. All they do is indoor soccer. There are leagues for little kids, on up to over 30s, co-ed and women-only. The facility itself is pretty old and worn out, but it does the job. There's a gallery above the main field, where friends and family can watch the game. There is also a soccer gear shop, and a snack bar that serves beer (cheap!)

4	Yes it's on Indian School and it's in the Avenues, but don't let that scare you because this is a great place to play and watch indoor soccer. My 8-year-old is playing in a league here and I've known other friends who've either played themselves or watched their kids play throughout the years. The facility is older, but the field is in good shape and they have everything you could want. Spectator seating is upstairs and its fun to watch the kids run around. Downstairs you have the team dugouts along with restrooms and a food and games area with windows facing the field, pinball games and an air hockey game. One nice thing is that if you're in the mood, the snack bar even serves beer and it's pretty cheap!They also have a full service soccer store with great prices and a great selection of clothes, shoes, and gear.So next time its over 100 degrees out and you and your kids start complaining about it being too hot to do anything, think about signing up for an indoor soccer league. They start every other month or so and playing in the air conditioning is a great way t stay in shape and get out of the heat!
