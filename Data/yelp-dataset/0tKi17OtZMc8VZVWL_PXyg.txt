3	We've been wanting to go for a while...so our first time was yesterday (9.4.2011) It was totally dead and there were no reviews on yelp, but we thought we'd take a chance. The food was really good, service was excellent. We were sitting next to a speaker and the music was kinda loud. But it was a nice change from the norm. I couldn't stop moving in my seat because the music was pretty catch-y The place looks like a dance hall more that a restaurant, but still nice. The staff was saying that the place gets crazy on the weekend, lots of dancing! 10pm to 4am sometimes. We'll defiantly go back.
1	The curtains are held up by PVC piping that should say it all.    I went there for lunch - place was 10 percent occupied and still took 1 hour for food to come.   On top of that food was piss poor - I ordered the pork dish - tasted and looked like old frozen pork that was nuked.   Never going back
5	Great authentic Cuban food lovingly prepared by the two young owners.  Wonderful service and a terrific menu.  It's a storefront cafe, so don't expect white linens and candlelight.  Do expect very good homestyle Cuban cooking and the best mojito you could ask for.
1	went by here today - 11/2/12 and the place is closed.
