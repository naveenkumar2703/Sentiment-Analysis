5	This is the best place in the world when I'm drunk at 3a.m. My favorite? The chicken cheese burgoco. You take the chicken taco and place it inside the cheeseburger. Best thing you've ever tasted.
1	One word... booger.  On my strawberry shake there was a booger that got stuck to my finger. Never never again will I ever eat at Del Taco and will try to convince anyone else not to as well.  When I tell someone about the booger it's pretty easy to sway their decision.
4	This is my fav del taco. Also quick and efficient. I don't mix meat and dairy so I always ask for "without meat" and they never get it wrong. They give me as much fire sauce as I want. And for those in know, the pretty black lady who works at night has an amazing voice and used to sing at a lounge downtown.
4	I don't normally write reviews on places but I actually liked this Del Taco. The lady at the drive thru is a little hard to understand but she's sweet and smiles and is polite. That goes a long way in my book. It's clean, the wait is pretty short, and it's close by.
