3	The French Bee is a wonderful little store that offers a wide range of upscale home furnishings.We use to go to their store in DC Ranch before it closed and always found it fun.  For those who have never been, it is somewhat an eclectic mix of furniture, assesories for the home, vaious dried flowers and nick nacks.  Imagine a large country English estate, like Downton Abbey and all the wonderful odds and ends that make up a room -- but more current.  Well, that's The French Bee.It's an antique store without all the chip dishes.  If you are looking for a vase or that special lamp, or silver hair brush, look no further, come to the French Bee!  It's fun. Go!

5	The French Bee is a slice of heaven on earth.  The staff is helpful and efficient.  The inventory is amazing offering a variety of price-points to suit anyone.  Their design team is smart and they will do custom work upon request.  Plan to browse through this shop when you visit.....the more you look, the more you see.  A wonderful shopping experience no doubt.
