4	This is my local Albertsons, they have pretty much all I ever need unless it's some specialty thing. Yes even Crab Legs! Think the only think I never found here that I was looking for in particular was some stone cracked grits for fancier tasty meals. Other than that, the service has always been nice and they even make good on miss priced signage. I know this because I got two huge bags of shrimp for $9 as they has a sale on it and a sign that said buy one get one free lol. It was quickly changed but they honored it. That is pretty cool and the shrimp was yummy!
2	Slow service at deli.  The meat department was in disarray  some of the meat cases were broken   check out was slow and customer service was bad
3	If you can't find it anywhere else, it's probably here!! Be prepared because it will be a bit overpriced compared to similar stores. I like going here because it was the only place close to me that sold mascarpone and ricotta cheese lol in one stop! There is a small little Starbucks stand on the inside!!as far as I'm concerned, this place doesn't get very much traffic anymore, but their locals are loyal
5	Very convenient since I live nearby. . The Store could use a remodel though...CASHIERS Always friendly....
