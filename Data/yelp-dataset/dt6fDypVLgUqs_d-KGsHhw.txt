5	Fast service. Free medium drink if you check in on FourSquare. Also good deals on their texting thingie. The manager was really nice and helpful. I'm glad they stopped using those horrible paper cups that made my blasts and shakes melt before I even drove off the lot! :)
4	Can't beat the happy hour on drinks....
1	I would give this place negative stars if possible. It almost makes me think that the previous comments are false. I hate to say I've been to this location more than once. It's literally right around the corner from me and yes the happy hour is what makes me want to go back but the service is the worst I've ever seen. Almost as worst as McDonald's on 99n lower buckeye. I will drive to Van Buren to get my drink instead of going 60 yards to this location. I can't be the only person that thinks this.
