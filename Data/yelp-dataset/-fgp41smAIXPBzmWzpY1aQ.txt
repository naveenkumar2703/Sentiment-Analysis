4	Like all Stein Marts, if you go and look around long enough, you'll run into something that you absolutely love and just also happens to be 90% off. HOT DOG!!!!!!
4	I love this store, shop here on a semi regular basis. Everything from artwork to sexy panties, petite clothing, shoes, etc. Don't always find what I want every time I stop by, but worth looking.  And for Penny Lane, I'm not a fancy old lady, just another shopper looking for petite clothes and other things for my home. No one is forcing you to shop there.
5	Just opened yesterday!!! Lots of selection. Great items. Better prices. This place will be packed before too long - which will leave Ross across the street empty. Get in early for the best selection.
4	I have to admit that I am a Stein Mart lover. Moreover I'm a bargain shopping fiend.For what it is, this place is great. Kind of like a mix (in quality and selection) between Nordstrom's Rack and TJ Maxx. You can really find some great deals here.I'd say that the target shopper here is between 40 and 60+. I'm not in that demographic YET but if you are in the market for some great golf/business casual apparel then this is your spot. I'm a big fan of the Ben Hogan shirts. Great quality and here you can get a $100 shirt for $30 or $40 bucks.Last visit was a great one. My wife found a REALLY awesome pea-coat for herself. $250 bucks marked down to $60, then she used a 20% off coupon she found on the net. Can you say SCORE!?... Well I can.Check it out. You may find something you like.
4	When I need clothes or am shopping for gifts, I'll come here before I go to Sears or JC Penney. I like this place. People are friendly and they have nice stuff that's affordable.
