1	Located in a small stripmall near the North East corner of Southern and Central Ave. Is this small buffet. When you enter, you have walk down a small walk way and then are met with a cashier who takes your drink order and counts the number of people in your party. You'll then claim your table and serve yourself. All the usual hits and misses of the average Chinese Buffet are here - none really stand out in all honesty. They are all pretty average and then came 'the incident'...I'm still traumatized by it. Seriously I am... I went there and it felt like any other time. I had gotten a chicken dish of somekind. i don't really recall. and I started eating it and it had a very odd taste. I didn't know what it was, it was like chicken... but not really. I then started to eat the rest of it and then I saw different bones that I have NEVER found in chickens before. I couldn't even identify which part of the chicken it was and the meat was very tough and then it hit me.... THAT WASN'T CHICKEN!!I almost threw up right then and there! I barely made it in time to go to the bathroom and vomit what I had eaten of my faux-chicken. Now I have NO idea what the hell it was that I ate. I tried to ask the cashier and she insisted it was chicken, but then she reluctantly said that it wasn't and when I demanded my money back she quit talking and wouldn't say exactly what the hell it was! The owner came out and started yelling at me and started yelling in Spanish (there is nothing quite like Spanish in a thick chinese accent!) and wouldn't stop even when I told her that I don't speak Spanish and then I realized she wasn't yelling to communicate with me, but with the other patrons who were starting to look at their own food with concern. I got my money back and bolted out of there and have NEVER gone back!!
2	I did better than Cher T. at this place when I ate there the other day.  If there was any "mystery meat" I must have liked it all right, because I don't remember it.  My biggest disappointment about a food item was the Miso soup.  The flavor was good, but it was barely warm!  The rest of the food was ok, selection a little small (I didn't count the trays at the time, but 20?)  The service was ok; no atmosphere at all.Would I go back?  Yes, if I'm right there & don't feel like driving 2 miles west to Jumbo Buffet (* * * *).  Whatever you do, don't go near Sun Star around the other side of the building!=======================================================3/16/09 Update:  Hungry & tired from a hard days' work today, I dragged myself one mile to the infamous...  King Wah!  Eek!The Good:*  Clean restaurant*  Comfortable seating, with Chinese Soft Rock softly playing.*  Friendly service.*  Menu varies some.*  Some unusual foods.*  Low prices ($5.45 lunch, $5.75 dinner)*  Everything is labeled.*  4 kinds of soup.*  Good BBQ Chicken.The not-so-good:*  Like the Miso Soup last time, the Hot Pork Soup could have been great but it was lukewarm.*  The Egg Flower Soup isn't very good (& of course, not hot enough).*  Awful little "hockey pucks" that are supposed to pass for Egg Foo Young!*  Only 23 trays of food, & salad bar is especially weak.Still a solid Two-Stars for King Wah.  Avoid it if you can.
5	First of all, "Rand H.", there is new management there so you should really try it again. There is no mystery meat that i saw there; everything looked normal and very tasty. (especially the walnut shrimp and Lo mein.) King Wah is my favorite place to go for lunch because they have really good prices and the service is right on top of thngs. When your drink gets a little low, the waitress/waiter is right there filling it back up. I also love how if you do not want to eat from the buffet, you can just order from their menu. The menu has many great foods to choose from and they will make your order right away.  Overall, I really enjoy eating at King Wah and I definately recommend eating there. ALSO, the new manager there Vickie, she's so nice and outgoing she'll make you feel like you've been friends with her for years. She really takes time to know her customers.
2	= = = = = = CLOSED = = = = = =King Wah is gone, gone, gone...  & not a day too soon.  (The sign out front says "Closed for Remodeling" but it wasn't the dining room that was the problem, it was the food!  They needed a new chef, not a carpenter!)
3	The infamous King Wah at this location folded a while back, but reopened today as "New King Wah Chinese Buffet".  The cooking is different, & the buffet now features 40 items instead of the 27 they used to have here.The food here is better than it was as the old place, but this new version has some baggage of its own:*  The dining room would be comfortable if it weren't for the Mexican music playing.  (It was fairly loud when Mike C. & I arrived here for lunch today, but they turned it down some after a bit.  OFF would have been better!)*  The table service was poor.*  There was breaded fried fish, but no Tartar Sauce to go on it.  I asked the manager if he had any, & he waved me over to the Ranch salad dressing!*  The broth for the Won Ton Soup was closer to hot water than to chicken broth.SO, this new place isn't great, but it IS better than the old King Wah was, & considering its LOW price of $4.95 for the Buffet (7 days), I think it earns 3 Stars.     :-)PS:  They didn't have the phone on yet, so it was cash only, at least for today.)
3	Went here with Rand H. on there opening day and its OK for a $4.99 buffet. The value is there but it does not measure up to most of the valley Chinese buffets. Some of the dishes were good ,like the crispy fish and some kind of mystery meat that was labeled fried fish but was not fish . Any way not to bad of a buffet for only 5 bucks.
3	It's near my house and cheap at $5.95 drink included all day. You have to pick and choose what time of day you visit to get the best food. Right at opening time and around dinner time the food is usually fresher (makes sense) but otherwise I can't complain. It's not gourmet but you're won't get sick eating there either. Oh and they have GOOD ice cream and sherbet plus their beverages include good quality green iced tea. My number one annoyance with this place is they only have one server it seems and she does all she can to avoid eye contact so you don't ask her for drink refills. My number two annoyance is their high chairs, they are very very old school (just plain old really) and I have yet to find one with straps that are secure. Not a good thing for someone with a squirmy toddler.
3	= = = = = = CLOSED = = = = = =The infamous King Wah has folded again!  Here's my take on what happened:Old King Wah:*  Comfortable dining room.*  Friendly Chinese hostess & Latina table service lady.= = = = = =The problems:*  Only 27 food items, & a poor balance of them.  Barely any salad or dessert, for instance.*  Always at least some of the "hot" items lukewarm!*  Poor recipes & cooking.  Some of the food was pretty bad!= = = = = =So out they go, the place sits for months, then "New King Wah" arises from the ashes:*  New operator increases the selection to 40 items.  Good!*  Bad chef gone, new one cooks better.  Good!= = = = = =The problems:*  New proprietor tries to save money by keeping almost the same old name so he doesn't have to buy a sign, even though the old King Wah was notoriously bad!  He just puts up a cheap banner out front.  (He's in trouble already!)*  He's not friendly.  Needs cute, cheery young Chinese lady as hostess & cashier!  (No flames please!  I'm not an anything-ist, just a retired successful businessman & fellow Yelpie messenger!)*  Dining room no longer comfortable as loud Mexican music blaring out while you're trying to eat Chinese food!*  Absolutely no table service now!*  Food is better, but still not right.  Won Tons floating in water instead of chicken broth, for example!*  Food balance still isn't right!  There's fish, for example, but no tartar sauce.  (Has this guy ever eaten at any other small Chinese Buffet?  He could learn A LOT from one visit to May Garden, for instance, where they have only 27 items, charge $6.35, & the place stays roaring busy every day by doing things right!)*  With 5 minutes of thought to fixing these minor problems at least $5.99 would have been completely reasonable, rather than the $4.99 he was charging, & New King Wah would have thrived.  The location & dining room are fine, & nearby competitor New Sun Star has issues of its own & wasn't the problem.*  I could make a go of this place & I'm not even Chinese!     :-)
