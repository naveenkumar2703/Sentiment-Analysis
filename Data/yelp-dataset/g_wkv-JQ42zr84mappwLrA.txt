2	I was in the neighborhood and needed to go to an ATM.  This is one of the most inconvenient entrances I've seen of almost any bank.  You drive around the whole building to hopefully get a parking space in front.I walked right up to the ATM, so this place gets an OK rating--but just.
1	The entrance is on one side, the exit on another. Don't go in the afternoon or you will be there forever. Oh, and don't go to try to get a money order if you're not a customer, they won't sell one to you. Guess they didn't want our money.
1	Just walked out of the bank due the the weirdo in the corner staring at me and clearly jacking off. No one else seemed to even notice or care.  Disgusting.
