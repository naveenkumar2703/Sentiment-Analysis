5	This shop has some of the most unique, stylish and affordable clothing I've seen, plus the owner is one of the friendliest people I've encountered in the retail world.  I am SO depressed that she has to close due to the lousy economy.  I'm writing this review in the hope that the Patricia Shoppe will resurface one day!
5	The owner works here every time I've been in and she's super nice and helpful.  Beautiful clothing and jewelry here.  Not everything here is "my taste."  The store does have a very earthy, bohemian feel to it (perfect for Madison, I prefer modern) but I always find something beautiful when I visit.  Prices range from low to moderate, nothing is really expensive here.  All of Patricia's things seem to be carefully selected for price and quality to match the area's young professional and college age demographic.  Lovely boutique that helps give State Street it's charm.  Please support your local businesses people!  It would be a shame to see a bunch of mall type stores take over these beautiful locally owned boutiques.
