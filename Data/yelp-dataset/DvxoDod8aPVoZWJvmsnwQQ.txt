4	I visited this outlet mall in November of 2007. I was excited to see the number of supposedly cool outlet stores in this mall (Vans, Hurley, Adidas), and was completely shocked when this turned out to be the best store in the whole freakin' place (the others, frankly, sucked). I mean, this is a Volcom Outlet Store, for crying out loud!! I bought the 2007 Volcom Stone Suit for around $90!! I also bought several t-shirts and a killer dress shirt. I probably need to go back here. . . I think I dropped close to $150 when I visited, but that was for 3 t-shirts, a dress shirt, and a suit. They also had the Tuxedo at a hefty discount. My impression was that the people who worked there didn't quite get why this stuff was "cool" ("weird" was the word someone used--there's nothing weird about good style and I gotta say, as annoyed as I am by the ubiquity of the Volcom brand, they still have some pretty cool shit).Sidenote: parking in this outlet mall sucks. All of the other stores, in my opinion, suck. Do not confuse this outlet mall with the other Las Vegas Outlet Mall (no "Premium" involved) which is located in the opposite direction south of the Strip. That outlet mall is creepy and has a weird vibe, but it does have a better Vans store.
4	I have few addictions, and this is one of them.  I've been here a few times and it's hard to leave without spending at least $100.  Their mens t-shirts are about $15, jeans around $40 and have pretty generous discounts on "clearance" stuff (like additional 50% off already discounted prices).
5	Great staff. Friendly and attentive.They have great clothes at a great price!
5	This is one of my favorite brands to wear.I love their "Las Vegas" shirts which look simple and clean. And since it was Black Friday, we got an additional 30% off.Way cheaper than the Volcom store inside the Miracle Mile Mall.
