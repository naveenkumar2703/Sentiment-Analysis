3	You never know what to expect at a WHBM store. There are times when you are smothered with compliments and attention and there are times when they don't notice you at all. Once, I walked in with my husband and they must have thought "here comes the checking account along with the customer". That day I was spoilt rotten by the staff to the extent that I ended up buying two outfits at full price. The next time, I was alone and looking for deals. So I hopped over to the SALE section. That day nobody bothered to throw a glance at me.Talking about the clothes, I love their designs and cuts but the materials that they use are just not upto the mark, especially the winter-wear. They use a lot of faux materials and charge you for pure wool, leather or cotton.
5	LOVE the staff here.. LOVE the little black dresses that ALWAYS fit me.. hard to accomplish in this short petite body with a bit of curve.. I mean.. its a 2 on top and 4 in the middle.. Im a member of the club.. and they always have an incentive at checkout.. sometimes I like .. and sometimes I pass.. depends on my AmX bill that month.. I have a beautiful white trench coat from here.. too long in the arm.. but they offered to send it out for me.. Ill even drive out of my way to go to this particular store..Date dress central.. yay!
