1	My wife brought my daughter here for a scheduled  appointment and was 5 minutes late. They said there were now 5 people ahead of her so she could wait or reschedule for the next available apt.5 hours later.
4	I have been to this location a couple of times.  The staff does a great job with my daughter and she loves being about to watch a movie or play a game while she gets her hair cut.  I love that there are locations all around the valley.  I usually go to the Gilbert location but we happend to be out in this area one day and I saw the shop.  It was the perfect opportunity to stop for a haircut.  My daughter's birthday was coming and she was also going on a mini vacation to her aunt's house plus back to school after her fall break so she was in need of some sprucing up.  :)We were in and out in 20 mins!  Thanks Cool Cuts 4 Kids!!
2	My daughter got a good haircut but the staff wasn't very friendly. We walked into an empty store and stood there for almost a minute before the two girls behind the counter would even acknowledge our presence while they chatted away. Then the first words out of their mouth were "can I get a phone number?" Not very inviting for a place who's marketing message is fun and cool.
2	I really want to like this place. It's brightly colored, my child can watch a movie while she gets her hair cut, and she gets excited for the train table. But every time I give this place one more try, I regret it. This is the fourth bad haircut my daughter has received here. A different stylist every time. Her bangs are uneven, as is the rest if her hair. I will not be coming back.
5	Jill was not only very friendly but did a great job on my sons first haircut. We will definitely come here again. Thanks Jill!
