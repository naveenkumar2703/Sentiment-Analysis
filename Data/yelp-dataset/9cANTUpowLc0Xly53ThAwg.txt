1	This store is expensive, dirty, and basically a place to walk to when you're too drunk to drive to a real grocery store for more beer.
3	It's got a drive-thru.  Drive-thru liquor store!  Hooray!Here is the conversation my friends had with the lady at the window of the drive-thru liquor store on the way home from our friend's wedding rehearsal: Lady: "Can I help you?"Friend: "Yeah, we want a six-pack of Bud Light and--"Lady: "Can I help you?"Friend: "...we want a six-pack of Bud Light and a six of Pacifico."Lady: "Pacifico?  We don't have that."Other friend: "It's a Mexican beer, yellow label...?"Lady: "No, I don't think we have that..." (note: they totally have that)Friend: "Do you have other Mexican beer?"Other friend: "Yeah, Mexican beer -- Pacifico, Dos Equis...?"Lady: "We have Tecate and Dos...dos..."Other friend: "Dos Equis?"Lady: "Dos Equis.  OK, what else do you want?"Friend: "...Bud Light?"Lady: "How many Bud Light?"Friend: "A six-pack...?"The lady went and got the beers, then asked my friend about her ethnicity and told us all about hers and we finally handed over money and got the beers and ran off. Note that we found this so hilarious that we went back before the wedding to get a pint of Jack Daniels.  Unfortunately someone else was working the window, the JD cost $17, and it was confiscated by security at the wedding venue.  Alas.Still, the Sunshine Mart provided valuable Arizona entertainment and will thus live on in our memories.  Hooray!  (We got the JD back after the wedding.)
5	Great Store. Competetive Prices. And super good selection of beer for a smaller store.
