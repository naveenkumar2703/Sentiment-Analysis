2	Not that I have ridiculously high expectations for a laundry mat but I do expect:1. The laundry mat not to totally WREAK of pot every other time I do my laundry (I'm trying to get that smell OUT of my clothes, not put it IN my clothes...jk)2. To feel safe there doing laundry at night.  There should be an attendant at least part time.  This economy needs jobs and here's a perfect opportunity!3. Most importantly, that my clothes actually get clean.  I pay a fair amount of money here to use the washers and dryers (especially the washers) and usually my stuff is only half-clean when I take it out (using the correct amount of soap and everything).  Damn!Damn you Parktowne! I wish I had laundry in my building.
4	Its always clean and easy to use.  Plus Burrito Drive is right next door - fill your mouth with something yummy while you wait for your load.  Can't ask much more from your laundromat
3	I hate trying to cram comforters and quilts into my home washing machine... stopped-by this laundromat to wash some large items and to take advantage of being able to use several washers and dryers at the same time.+ Good parking+ Well lit+ Change machine accepts $1, $5, $10, $20 - very nice to have so many options+ Plenty of large machines- Machines didn't seem to get things quite as clean as home washer does- Seemingly clean, but deeper dive shows most things are quite dirty; wiped-down a few surfaces with Lysol wipes (and was glad that I did)Laundromats aren't anything great, in general; this one is about average.
