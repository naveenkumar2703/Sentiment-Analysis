3	Food is good, cookies are great. Buy one cookie and get one free. Bargain. I love the half sandwich and soup. The chicken posole is delicious and a favorite of mine. A great plus is there is free wireless internet service.
2	I ordered a mozzarella and tomato sandwich, a small order of pasta salad, and a drink and it came out to $13. For $13 I could of gone to a restaurant. Paradise Bakery has some of the best cookies around but the food is a rip off.
5	dude their salads are awesome that's all i get here for 7 bucks plus tax they are a bit pricey but if you can deal with that than its good stuff oh yeah the cookies are bomb too haha i have returned to this place many times
