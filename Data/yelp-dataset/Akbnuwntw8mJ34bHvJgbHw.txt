1	If you have small dogs, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS PARK!  Yes, the park is very small, but it has now been taken over by the huge dogs.  I saw ONLY HUGE DOGS (except for my own).  Now this park is no longer appropriate for small dogs whatsoever. I took my two Pugs (only about 10 lbs each), and they immediately got trampled on by all the Huskies, Rottweilers and Labs. And the moronic owners of these enormous dogs just stood there slack-jawed and watched me desperately trying to scoop up my two little dogs and get them to safety. No one offered to help me at all.So if you love your small dogs and don't feel like taking a trip to the emergency animal hospital or traumatizing them with permanent physical or emotional damage - then go elsewhere.  But if you've got a big dog - knock yourself out.

Basketball courts on one side then little dog park on the other. In the middle of the park there's 2 separate playground sets and this dope little water fountain for dogs, kids -- and the kid inside of you to play in/cool off..
