3	I am not a big Smart and Final fan.I do love two things here that I can't or have a hard time finding anywhere else. Sunkist Fruit Punch (for less than $3) and a big bottle of El Torito Cilantro Pepita Caesar Dressing for less than $5. This is very similar to the cilantro dressing at El Pollo Loco and is so yummy. They do have this product at Walmart but it is much smaller size for $3. Most of their items are over priced and/or just as much as a regular grocery store.
2	So I went here yesterday to return an item I was not able to use and since I did not have the receipt I was issued a gift card. I decided to use the gift card immediately so I wouldn't have to drive back but when I went to check out the register would not take the gift card. The asst. mgr then calls their customer servicw and I was told that the gift card was in their system but since I  barely got the card it was not active. I was then advised to return and use it later. I dont go to this store often so returning would not be convenient.
4	I really can't see why people knock this place. Admittedly, they don't have the widest selection in the world and some of the package sizes are a bit on the large side, but overall, it's hard to beat the value. I get almost all my staple items here such as milk, lettuce, bread, ground turkey etc. Ok so if I decide it's time for musubi, I'll have to make make a run to the good ole' wal mart for the seaweed and furikake. Other than that, smart n final pretty much has everything I need and at great prices. I'm definitely a loyal customer.
