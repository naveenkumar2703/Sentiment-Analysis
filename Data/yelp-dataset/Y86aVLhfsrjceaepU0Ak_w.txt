5	When I grow up, I want to live in the West End. It's more upmarket than Newington, less studenty than New Town or Marchmont, and much more central than Brunstfield or Stockbridge.  For that reason, it tends to attract the young proffessional types and so has a really nice feel to it.And quite apart from the practicalities, its full of gorgeous Georgian architecture and little green parks dotted about all over the place. As well as being full of great bars like the Ghillie Dhu or The Rutland, there are also lovely restaurants like La Piazza and A Room in the West End.
4	I'm not entirely sure if "The West End" constitutes a neighbourhood in itself. I'd never really heard the area described as this until I noticed the posters stuck to railings as in the featured picture. I think it means the area from the Fraser's end of Princes street down to Haymarket Station or thereabouts.Anyway, like most of the city it's quite nice, but unless you count Lothian Road, which I'm not sure could be classed as "West End", there's not really much happening this end of town in my opinion. A few coffees shops, restaurants, and some nice hotels, but it's mainly office orientated. As such, the closer you get to Haymarket, the deader everything feels the further it gets past 5pm.
3	As far as being in New Town goes, I actually quite like the West End. Not as much as Stockbridge (I like being around water), but WAY more than the East End of Princes Street. The only problem I'd really have with ever living around that area is its extreme proximity to Princes Street, which is my idea of hell. It is decidedly the quieter side of that area, though, and is close to lots of cute cafes and shops.Fiona was right in saying that it attracts many young professionals, mainly because it is more upmarket than Newington, and way outside most students price-range. But that gives the place a great feel, to be honest. A lot more sedate. And it smells less like puke than this side of town.
