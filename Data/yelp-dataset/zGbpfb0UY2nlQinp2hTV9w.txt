5	Okay, before everyone gets mad at me for adding yet another new entry for Wynn, here's the catch.  The Country Club @ Wynn Casino is NOT the golf course.  It is the bar/restaurant at the golf course.  As of today, you will notice that all 23 of those reviews were written by people who have never played the course.When it first opened, the Wynn Golf Club was open only to hotel guests for the staggering price of $500 per round.  Later, as the economy soured, it was opened up to anyone who had the pocketbook to afford it.  More recently, they have begun offering discounted rates to attract enough golfers to keep the caddies busy. $300 will get you on the course Mon-Thur.  The rate goes to $375 Fri-Sun.  This includes a caddy, rental clubs, rental shoes, golf cart, bottled water and various sports drinks.  Actually not a bad deal in my book.  I played the course twice in the same day as the replay rate was only $200.The layout is tough.  Only one of the par 4s is less than 400 yards.  That hole is 386 yards but has an optical quality to it that will make you swear it's the longest hole on the course.  Many courses are not memorable because all the holes look the same.  You will find it difficult to remember this course at times because each and every hole is incredibly different.  Between streams, bridges, ponds, bunkers and even waterfalls, each hole is a little piece of artwork.  Go to the Wynn website for pictures and more information.This is a must-play, even if it's only once in your entire life.  At times, it is impossible to believe your right on the Las Vegas strip, with only the  towering Wynn and Encore casinoes to remind you where you are.  The staff will treat you like a celebrity from the moment you check in at the pro shop.  A personal concierge will escort you to the locker room and ensure everything is taken care of. A few final tips:Bring a cameraBring your own golf ballsBring a change of clothes (they have showers in the locker room)Enjoy yourself regardless of how you play
5	An excellent golf spot! Sophisticated and high class, the clubhouse has all the perfect amenities.
2	**THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON PROCESS OF BOOKING THE GOLF COURSE**So I was asked to make a reservation for golf club to entertain very important people at the company I work. Since the person who will be entertaining the important people was staying at Encore, I went ahead and made a reservation at Wynn Golf Club. Man I didn't think this process would be such a hassle. I called them about 4 times, and I was able to finally make a reservation on the 4th attempt.Below are required information:- Personal credit card information of a person who is attending the golf and is staying at Encore or Wynn  *This includes credit card number, security code  *Based on the concierge who answers the phone, you may even be asked to provide billing address  *If none of the attendees are staying at Encore or Wynn, I think you also need fill out some sort of authorization form- Names of all the attendees- Phone number of the person who the reservation is made under**If you are renting the golf club and shoes, you'll also need to provide**- Shoe sizes of the attendees- Whether attendees are right handed or left handedSo first time I called, I couldn't make the reservation because they required credit card information to make a reservation. 2nd attept, I couldn't make the reservation again because they wouldn't accept corporate credit card for the reservation. 3rd time I called, they wouldn't accept the reservation because I didn't have the names of everyone attending. Finally on the 4th, I was able to finally make the reservation. Boy was this a hassle!Oh also as of Jan. 2011, the tee time on Sunday is $500. This includes rental for cart, shoes, clubs, and refreshments. Does not include gratuity or golf balls.Also the cancellation policy is that they will charge 50% unless cancelled 24 hours prior to the scheduled tee time.
4	Yeah, the price is steep.... if you can get over the price, this is actually an awesome Fazio course. This course has way more bang for your buck then Bali Hai. That place is a yawn and a rip off. Spend the extra couple hundred and come play the Wynn. It's well worth it. The holes are NOT boring. They demand golf shots to score well. This place gets knocked frequently because of the price and exclusivity. Sour grapes. Because of those reviews I admit my expectations were low. Maybe that contributed more to being so impressed. The service is awesome from the moment you pick up the phone to book a tee time, to the moment you leave the locker room where they polish your shoes and engrave a bag tag for you while you play. There is no OB except on the holes that border the streets. Very forgiving. But that doesn't mean it's easy, just means you can salvage $4 golf balls more easily. You can't record your score for your GHIN because the course isn't officially rated for whatever reason. This course isn't going to be around forever. When the market turns, they will build another hotel in all likelihood. Could be awhile, but point is, play it if you can. It's expensive, but in comparison to some other clubs in the area, not too bad for what you get.
5	This place is beautiful. Didn't golf here so don't know how the whole course is. But we had cocktails at the above restaurant, the country club, and it overlooks this course. It was gorgeous, the bf stated when we come back he is definitely playing!!
1	If you are a woman, or plan to bring any woman in your foursome do not play here.  There are no woman tees so you have to tee off from the mens tees.  There are many big carries so its obvious the customer they are looking for are only men.  I made the reservation, spoke to the golf shop twice, checked in, and was told I needed to play from the mens tee box by our caddy!  VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  The round was a disaster as you would expect, and I was mad the whole time.   I wrote  a letter to Steve Wynn letting him know my disappointment and felt that I should have been made aware of this in advance so "as the customer I could decide if I still wanted to play at his property, and not be shocked when the caddy announced it to me on the #1 tee box!"   He did not reply.
3	I had high expectations for this golf course based upon the price, but like a lot of things on the strip, "All that glitters is not gold".Don't get me wrong.  The service was impeccable.  My good friend and I were greeted by a Mgr and our caddy, Ken.  Ken knew the course well and gave me some great reads on putts.  In addition, the locker room had a huge shower so I could get cleaned up before I headed back to the Venetian.  Lastly, the bartender was super cool at the 19th Hole.As you can see from the pics, the course has some nice holes.  But overall, the course was nothing special and certainly not worth the price (over $400 w/ caddy!).  I would rather spend a little extra and play Shadow Creek in N. Vegas or head up to Monterey to play Pebble Beach.  Overall rating - "52" - 5 Stars for service and 2 Stars for the price in relation to the course layout.
5	My husband played a wonderful round here last weekend, and I got to ride along in the cart and watch, without playing. Even though I didn't play, I was treated extremely well by every staff member, and the course was so beautiful! Our golfcart was stocked with bottled water, sports drinks, sodas, and there were stops along the way to purchase snacks and alcohol. Our caddy, Chase, was very helpful and patient, and made sure to personalize the experience and tips for each player in the group. My husband even got applause for his 15 foot putt for birdie on the 18th hole, from the gallery watching from the resort. Back at the locker room, the attendant had engraved a bag tag for him, wishing him a happy birthday. It was a wonderful experience, and we will definitely be back!
4	Very nice course layout and the service were spectacular.  Unfortunately, the course was not in the great condition that everyone raves about because it lost a lot of fairways due to the extreme heat late July.  From the fairways on several holes, I found myself hitting from large dirt patches.  Management is doing a lot of work in repairing the damage to get it back to its original condition.  It would be nice if they discounted the price or warned players when booking tee times.  Overall, still a nice experience and look forward to playing it again when the course is repaired.
5	My husband and I splurged and played this course on our anniversary.  It was beautiful and the service was excellent.   You walk out of the Wynn Hotel and you are right on the course. Since we were staying at the Wynn it saved the price of a taxi to a course off the strip (one way to justify the high green fees).   The locker room is so comfortable and soothing I wanted to stay there all day.  Even the restroom in the middle of the course was luxurious, the Wynn spares no expense to make the entire experience pleasurable.  The course is well maintained and challenging.  Our caddy, Jennifer, gave some great tips and could read the greens well.   The price is all inclusive (cart, cad die, clubs, shoes, driving range, water and soft drinks on the cart). Again, it helps to remember this when you see the green fees.   We were fortunate to have nice weather. The course is open daily rain or shine, and you pay the same price every day of the week.  We had a very enjoyable day on the golf course and would do it again if we go back to the Wynn.
3	Ok Golf at the Wynn was going to be the highlight of the trip. It was not. Here is why: It des not hold up the extreme upper end experience on the course that the service would indicate it will. The service far outweighs the golf course. We could not ask for better more professional service from pro shop, to locker room to caddy but that is where the world class stops. The golf course was a 200 dollar course with a 300 dollar Vegas premium. I get the price of real estate, and the cost of maintaining a course in the desert but still not anywhere near the course it should be. If you want the service to match the course, play Pebble Beach. Make a day of it for a decent time just do not expect Wynn course to be world class other than service. Enjoy the round save some money playing golf and not gambling.
5	My husband and I had our drinks overlooking the beautiful golf course and magnificent waterfall following a scrumptious dinner.  Our bartender was super sweet, informative and a pleasure to talk to.  She offered some history about the country club and its golf course.It was so nice to enjoy a beautiful evening enjoying some refreshing alcoholic beverages while enjoying the breath taking view.  I forgot about the hustle and bustle of Sin City.  We were even able to catch a glimpse of Mr. Wynn's private villa.  Great ambiance, delicious food, and drinks made to perfection; we will definitely be back.
5	What an awesome golf course!  Located right in the heart of Las Vegas, a green paradise in the middle of a desert, lifetime experience to enjoy a round of golf under 100 degrees temperature!
1	Stayed in Encore and played on Aug 16 with friend.  Course's fairway is in extremely bad shape, probably worst than most of of munis. The course should NOT be opened for play at all, specially with high expectation anticipated from Steve Wynn's standard. Walk-off the course with SHOULD-NOT-RETURN mental note. Although the caddie service is excellent, probably the only positive from the experience.
