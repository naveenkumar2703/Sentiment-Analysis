5	Extremely competent staff. Got me into the right contact lenses on the first appt. Everyone was friendly and I interacted with every employee on my first visit. They have a Middleton clinic as well, and a good website with lots of information about the doctors. I researched a lot before I found them and I'm glad I made the right choice. Have already had friends go to see them.
4	Very thorough and pleasant staff.  Dr Callie Maursetter was wonderful!  Knowledgeable, professional and friendly.   I would give this 5 stars except for 1 thing.  First, whatever that contraption is to measure my eye pressure is awful. There is no puff of air but to say you are going to "tickle my eye" is the understatement of the year.  Instead of scarring the crap out of me with air this little contraption sticks something in it, it is as terrifying and equally uncomfortable as the dang puff test. If it wasn't for this incident I would have had a 5 star visit.
5	The opticians and optometrists at Isthmus Eye Care are so friendly and helpful. I recently had an eye exam and contact fitting here, and it was a great experience. Not a huge fan of having my pupils dilated, but they put some drops in afterward which was supposed to help the dilation go away faster. Dr. Maursetter was very nice and explained the purpose of all the tests she was running. It's always helpful when a professional is explaining what they are doing instead of just doing something and leaving you wondering why they are doing it. She gave me some daily contacts to try since I had complained of dryness with the two week contacts. After wearing those for a week, I decided I did not like them so they gave me a different brand to try on. They are very accommodating of your needs, and ordering contacts from them is quick and easy.
