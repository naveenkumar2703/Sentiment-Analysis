4	I'm am such a kid at heart, therefore I love the Early Learning Centre. One of my friends has just had a baby so now I actually have someone to buy toys for. They have such awesome toys and when I was little my mum bought my favourite Fuzzy Felt Farm and I was ecstatic to see they have so many versions of it now. I can't wait till my friends baby is a little older so I can buy one!They stock all manner of toys here, little talking books, cuddly toys, plastic musical instruments, sandpits, slides, paddling pools... they have it all! The prices are reasonable too and you know that you're always getting something goo quality when you shop at ELC, I guess that's why it's been around for so long. I have purchased some items for myself recently from ELC including a snazzy watering can with bumble bees and caterpillars on it. I also got a super cute Wall-E toy too.
