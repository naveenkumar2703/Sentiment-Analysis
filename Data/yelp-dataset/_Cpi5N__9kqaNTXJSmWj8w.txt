1	First visit since they switched from Kachina to Desert Cadillac.  Also will be my last visit!!!  Very disappointed with bait and switch in the service department.  Went online to book appointment for an oil change.  They had a coupon for $39.99 (which I thought was kind of high) after I dropped of vehicle and was in the waiting room they came in and told me the oil change would be $100 plus and that they would Not accept the coupon from their website.  If you need your Cadillac serviced go somewhere else!!!
1	STAY AWAY!! They are dishonest and bought out by Earnhardt.  They will add false charges to your repair bills to compensate for their losses DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE FOR REPAIRS!!!
1	Totally agree with the other reviewers.  The repair shop is less than ethical.
4	Some of my friends went there and got some Cadillac cars and they were so nice and helpful in my friends picking out the predict Car I have heard all good things about this garage
