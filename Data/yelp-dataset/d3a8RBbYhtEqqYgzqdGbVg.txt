3	Went here after the Yelp Western Adventure as we received $10 in slot play.  My main gripe about this casino is the smoke. There is so much cigarette smoke lingering in this casino, if you are not a smoker you will leave smelling like one. Other than that, it is your average casino. Nothing like Vegas, but will do if you do not mind all the smoke.
