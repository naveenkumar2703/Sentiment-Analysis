However, the doctor was not sensitive to my questions, didn't listen thoroughly, and performed an unnecessary procedure with no after-care instructions that left me with a scar in a visible area. He also made me feel rushed each time I came in, always telling me that he would address "that" question "next time" but when next time came, he told me that he didn't schedule enough time to address it, and I would have to come back again. I took this as an attempt to build up charges to my insurance company for multiple visits, which I found unnecessary, especially in light of the fact that on day one I had asked for one appointment to discuss multiple things. In addition to this, the receptionist asked me pointed questions about why I needed to see the doctor - in front of a waiting room full of patients. Evidently, patient privacy isn't much of a concern here.

I had a skin screening at a college health fair was told to get some dry patches removed before they became cancerous. The Doc said the same thing and took care of all them - quite a few little ones and a couple of larger. He was thorough, explained the after care and only charged the co-pay for all the work and exam.

Like most doctors, they're not going to sit and have a 30 min appt to talk about every single medical problem you have. I've always found Dr. Ponitch and his receptionists to be kind and professional. I have returned and will continue to return to him for minor dermatological issues.
