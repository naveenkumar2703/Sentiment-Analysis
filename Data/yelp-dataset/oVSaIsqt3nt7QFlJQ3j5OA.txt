5	Friendly people - Clean, organized store. Associate did a better job of trying to assist me than an earlier Shack I popped into. This location works for me
4	One Radio Shack is pretty much like another most of the time but the staff here were helpful without being stalkers, there was a decent selection (no empty shelves due to the New Year clearance sales), and they had evening hours even though they looked like the only open business at 7:30 pm when I went.
5	I have always been a fan of Radio Shack. Ever since my dad had his own store in the early 80's here in Las Vegas. He would send my sister Linda and I electronic gadgets that we could use in Germany. I still have my radio, tape recorder, speakers and a couple of other items and they still work!! The Radio Shack we frequent is by Sams Club on East Tropicana. The most important thing for me is that the staff is knowledgeable and informed because I usually have questions. Every time I have been in this store I have had great customer service, the store is well maintained and the staff actually like being there which says a lot for standard operating procedures being followed and pride in what you do. Kudos to Ron, Leslie and Dee. You heard me!
1	The only thing worse than the store manager's attitude was perhaps his hygiene. Rude as all hell. I'm done with this place. I'm off to Fry's.  Update: radio shack price: 10.48. Fry's 3.22
