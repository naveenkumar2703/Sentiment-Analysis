4	Dr. Harvey Chin has been my dentist for almost 8yrs now.  Flexible scheduling, nice office and great saff.  If you're new in town and need a dentist, I would recommend this one.
1	I had a very bad experienceWith this dentist he seems nice but  his work is awfulHe put a new crown 3 root canals on the same tooth for 2 weeks I was tasting a very strong chemical coming out of my tooth and can't still chew on I Had to go to different dentist to fix my tooth.Stay away from this Dentist. He should not be practicing.
5	Dr Chin and his staff are very knowledgeable. He always listens to my concerns. By far a great experience here.
