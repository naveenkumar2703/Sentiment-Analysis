4	One of my favorite dollar stores. They have an amazing selection of items, they have relativelygood quality items, and I've found some great quality gems in this store. They have a clothing rack of bad clothes,  ut I found a plain gray sweater that fit me -for only a dollar, that's amazing! I haven't tried the food, and the pumpkins were covered in some weird spots, but the actual items are relatively good, and really cheap. Don't expect anything to last forever, but most of it work a just fine for a typical product lifetime. You do run the risk of cheap goods, butcaregul shopping can usually get around that.
5	Great place to get awesome holiday decorations on the cheap. TONS of other things too. Brand names for 99 cents and they even have produce.
4	One of the best dollar stores in the valley.  I always find some hidden treasure (i.e. Magic Sponges, Febreeze, Command Hooks, and OPI Nail Polish). Their supply of these items goes fast, so stock up if you happen to strike gold. They also have a steady supply of other, less expensive, name brand products, especially in the office supplies and cleaning sections. However, I love this place for their vast selection of off-brand products as much as I do for their hidden treasures.
4	Um it's a dollar store, they have EVERYTHING. Though not everything they have is the greatest quality (obviously). But the dollar tree up the street has some nicer things. But this place has food!!Also though, it's pretty ghetto. Get some sketchy people hanging around. But overall if definitely recommend everyone come here before going grocery shopping elsewhere.
