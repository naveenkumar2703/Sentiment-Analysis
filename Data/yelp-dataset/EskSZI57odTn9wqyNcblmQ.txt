3	they have gas and beer always on sale........not a bad set up.... free limes with your $7.99 12 pack of tecate as well.
4	You can always count on cheaper gas here plus they have a $5 car wash.
3	it was ok.  Got my gas and the people were a little rude.  But... it IS a gas station.
1	The door says open 24 hours but not really. I live in the apartments behind it so it's usually a short wall but the past couple times I have been there the doors are locked and a note on the door that says shift change.... Which is all good but when you wait outside for 10 mins and there are 2 employees plus there friends in there laughing  and hanging out, it's not really professional. I was waiting as multiple people walked up to the door then leave cause it's closed. Probably should not say 24 hours if your closed at all. Last time I go to this place. If you need anything I suggest you go to qt on 43rd and union. Always nice there and cheaper!
