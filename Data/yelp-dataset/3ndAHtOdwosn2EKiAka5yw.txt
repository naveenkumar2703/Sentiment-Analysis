2	Gas prices are a little competitive, and the cooler is stocked well with what little space they have, and the coffee is always available. This is a very old site, and grungy, but the people are nice. I do not know why this gas station charges above market for gas.
1	Dirty location. 5 gas pumps were broken, 3 were tagged out of service. This location is poorly maintained.
4	Open 24/7. I just have to say every time we come here the girls that work inside are very nice and if they get a chance they will talk with you. Since they see us at least once a week we talk more. It always is clean inside and they are usually stalked up on drinks and snacks etc. Of course we will be back.
