5	Surprisingly, this restaurant dishes up really good spicy Chinese food. Their Shui Zhu anything is absolutely wonderful. I eat so many bowls of rice with it, they go so well together. And the rice is cooked nice and fluffyThe location is pretty strange though. It's odd how they still have decent business. So it must be the food. They have really good cold dish appetizers too. I love the tongue and beef slices in peppercorns.
5	Superb! And a shocker to some degree. (more on that in a bit)Can't argue with the reviews already given.I don't know what region the food is of origin, but Spicy is it's foundation.And it's tasty!!A Saturday lunch.3 tables active. Two other couples, and one big family. I was not the only tourist looking patron. But I was outnumbered. And thats GOOD!Maybe 15 total tables in the place available. Nice size in my opinion.Good clean room too.Yes, new owners. "wun yeer now thank yoo" (no offense intended)Spicy & Sour Noodle Soup, $5.95 (like spaghetti w/ chili broth, and herbs)Wontons tossed in chili sauce, $5.95 (YUM, nice garlic hints)Sliced Chicken w/ Szechwan Sauce, $8.95 (YUM YUM, spicy smoke flavor  trails off w/ a sweetness, YUM)Yes the rice is done w/ perfection as a goal. Details, all in the details.The "shocker"........This menu is as authentic as I've ever seen. Reminds me of times in San Francisco's Chinatown when I might have ordered off a menu to be refused by the wait staff  "No no no no, shaking their head". You see, I'm a big tall Gringo looking dude......they were just protecting me is my guess. Saving my fragile "naive" palate.Yun Nan Garden offers what I think you can't get many places in SF anymore. At least spelled out on the menu, here they are.Chongqing Spicy Frog.Blackened Pepper w/ Eel.Three Flavors (Squid, Fish, Black Sea Cucumber)Chickens Intestine w/ pepper sauce.And the afore mentioned Pigs Ear.Don't be afraid though. You will just be missing out on some tasty meals.I like the location, easy in, and easy out. Great parking!!Just below Spring Mountain, 3rd driveway on the right off Valley View.Yun Nan will be on your right, far corner of the first building. (mid lot)7 days a week, 11am - 10pm.And they have 2 additional locations:Monterey Park, CA. 301 N. Garfield Ave.Hacienda Heights, CA. 1229 S. Hacienda Blvd.Enjoy!!
4	I'm still breathing flames, feeling chest hairs sprout, and honestly dreading what morning will bring, the food was that spicy...not all of it, but what was spicy, was hellish.Tonight was a personal (read party of 3 with husband, mother and me) at Yun Nan Garden.  I did my homework and citysearched it, too -- finding a website that gave me the menu (so I thought) and I'd even made a list of dishes we were absolutely going to order...and while it did give me a quick introduction to Yun Nan province cooking, it wasn't the same restaurant.  We ordered five dishes -- Szechuan Style Cold Noodles, Chongqing Spicy Chicken (no relation to ChunKing, but I'm sure this is where that mess of a name is derived...), Potato with Sour Sauce, String Beans with Chinese sausage and Yunnan Style Dried Beef.  The place is tiny -- about 15 tables, and it's actually quite attractive.  There's a small display case on the north wall, in front of the kitchen -- and that's where those side dishes (see pics) of pigs ear, tripe, chicken feet, chukka seaweed all live...The food came out fast and furious.  There was only one other table of Caucasians in the room -- we were eyed with what felt like suspicion since it's located on the back side of the third building in the same center that houses PKL...We dug into the noodles first -- they needed to sit -- and be stirred lots -- because the best bites are at the bottom where they've had a chance to soak up that incredible sauce -- don't think peanut butter -- this is the real thing -- light, perfect for hot Vegas weather.The dried beef was hot, but not incendiary if you avoided the dried red chili peppers -- flavor is great, but it's sliced thin, so it's not really jerky like (say like LOS), think shit on a shingle kind of dried beef -- and I happen to like that, so this was good. The potatoes were astounding -- although we're pretty sure it's mountain yam, not really potato.  I saw it on another guest's table, and it was terrific.  The string beans had nothing that resembled sausage -- it was pork belly and since bacon's our favorite vegetable, it was great.The chicken -- at first I thought our server was just humoring us, then she said "really, it's my favorite" -- and smiled...so we were in.  You know those little dried red chilies you avoid when you see them whole in "spicy dishes" -- imagine taking oh, about a pound and chopping them up like scallions -- in other words, kinda hard to pick out, and mix that up with chicken pieces so tiny, it's hard to tell if it's in fact chicken (tasted more like pork rinds -- again, not really a problem for us...).  We soldiered through it, then after about a gallon of water, decided we'd try to pick out the chicken which now was about as hot as the chilies...  by this time the noodles were all happy, as were we...even though our concerns about tomorrow morning started to gel.We sat for a while watching other tables eating -- mopping their brows -- and checking out their dishes... the fried salt and pepper fish looked phenomenal, as did the tofu dishes.  Our server also recd a fish with garlic sauce...The menu is seriously fascinating -- I guess I've lived a sheltered life -- and I thought I'd been adventurous, but I've not seen a menu like this in America ever -- eel rice, spicy pork intestine, spicy frog, cold kidney, stir fried eel with pickled pepper, fat pork with garlic, black sea cucumber, chicken's intestine, pork leg skin...This is some serious adventurous eating folks -- tonight, I took baby steps... We went to Red Mango for relief...and I made a note to go back again.p.s. I'd have killed for a cold beer -- but they don't have a liquor license.
5	If you are craving authentic delicious Chinese food that is spicier than anything you've ever tasted, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you try Yun Nan Gardens.  Oh my goodness, the food was excellent and I'm planning my next trip to Vegas just to seriously eat here again.  My husband & I were sick and tired of eating at the hotels and after spending a FORTUNE on mediocre food we made our way to Yun Nan.  We could not have been more satisfied. To start off, there is a cold counter which had some strange looking pieces of meat as well as some fresh and pickled vegetables.  I passed on the meats but chose the vegetables:  pickled cucumbers, an asian bean sprout slaw, and a marinated seaweed salad.  They were all fresh, tasty, and a refreshing accompaniment for the spiciness that was to follow.I'm a noodle junkie so we ordered the hot noodle soup and the szechuan cold noodle salad.  They were both excellent but the only difference is that 1 was hot & the other was cold so my advice would be to order just one.  The broth was sour, spicy, salty, extremely flavorful and the flour noodles were cooked to perfection.  Bean sprouts, cilantro, TONS of red chile slices, and some other cooked greens really added to the texture.  Make sure to mix it well so that you are getting all the ingredients in every bite.  Another great dish was the spicy braised beef in the hotpot.  I kid you not, it is SPICY and I think we actually picked a plate full of red chiles and jalapenos from the dish.  It had a nice soy broth but the best part is soybean sprout that is cooking at the bottom of the pot.  We didn't realize it was there until halfway through the meal and it was a pleasant discovery.  My advice again is the mix the hotpots thoroughly before consumption:  you don't know what goodies are at the bottom :)Finally we had the dried beef fried rice.  It was subtle but the flavor was amazing & it was perfect to offset all the spice and entrees.The total bill was only $36 which was the cheapest meal we had in Vegas.  I HIGHLY recommend Yun Nan and consider it to be quite a discovery and my taste buds thank me for it.  Can't wait to go back!!
2	I am sorry to pour on everyone's parade, but this place isn't all that.  This is the sister restaurant to the one in Monterey Park, CA.  Okay that is dead central Asian community, many may say this place can't compare and it's not bad for Vegas.  I am sorry I have to be fair and honest.  If you have been to the other restaurant then you will know that this place can NOT hold a candle.For the full review and pics go to http://www.kats9lives.com/2008/07/same-store-in-different-states-not-same.htmlFirst off, this place is located in the most remote area.  It's back behind the more popular stores, away from the eyes of people.  There wasn't that many people there and when you go in you will see the people working there just sitting around chatting, which is fine.  We immediately went to get some small plate dishes.  My favorite at the one in Monterey Park is the "Fu Chi Fei Pian", which they had here.  It tasted somewhat similar but not quite.  Yes, it is spicy but it lacks real flavor.My family really liked the Dan Dan Mien and they thought that was really good, but what I really wanted there was the Wontons in Chili Oil.  HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! It was just pure chili oil and no flavor.  The one in Monterey Park is spicy and emanates flavor.  I didn't really care for the wontons either.  It really was just not that good.  I am glad we only came for an after dinner snack.  So disappointing after reading the rave reviews.  I was so excited to find out that this was the same chain as the one in Monterey Park.  Yelpers, you got my hopes up and really let me down.  My family is pretty Chinese and my sister LOVES spicy food, but none of us really liked this place.  I guess for Vegas you can settle?  But I don't believe that to be true because Vegas has tons of great restaurants.  This place just doesn't measure up.  Sorry.
4	I have to agree with the reviews here.  Brought my in-law from mainland China and she was adamant about eating only Chinese.  In addition, she's from Wu Han which is accustom to spicy food.  She was all smiles and loved the speed of the service, taste of the dishes, and the spiciness levels.  Whew!  I was afraid she'd be bitching about eating American or Vietnamese food.In any case, the food here is authentic.  Even the customers are from the mainland too.  The flavors are deep, oily, salty, and above all, spicy.  If you're looking for real Chinese food, this place is pretty close.  The service is real too, which is you gotta flag down the waitresses, be curt, and expect fast responses.I took off one star for room for improvement.  Service could be more Americanized, more courteous, more structured.  Ahh, I guess Chinese will always be Chinese.
5	Oh, my....this is the kind of Chinese food I am crazy about.  The flavors are so intense and complex that I get full within a few bites.  I had Dan Dan noodles and a plate of their cold dish offerings from a converted salad bar setup.  I don't know exactly what the cold dishes were:  I think one was some kind of seaweed, one had edamame, chinese greens, cilantro and dried red peppers, one had big chunks of cucumber, one had fried or braised tofu slices, and one had pork ear (I asked because I like pork ear).  There were other things, but I wanted some green stuff to offset the noodles.  The plate of cold stuff costs an extra $4.50, but I got way more than my money's worth.  The Dan Dan noodles were thick and chewy, with a distinctive wheat taste, a rich, oily, spicy meat sauce that perfectly embodied ma-la flavors underneath, and chopped peanuts on top.I'd had a very difficult time trying to choose a dish from the menu:  so many things looked good to me.  Sliced fish?  Preserved pork?  Lamb?  I'll have to go back again and again.If you aren't used to spicy food, you might want to avoid some of the dishes marked as spicy on the menu.  Or maybe not, because you would be really missing out.The atmosphere and decor are spartan/casual.  It doesn't matter.  The food is that good.
4	For my first review of 2009 I really wanted to find a 5 star place but I guess this one will have to do! It's hard finding 5 star places anyway so a 4 star review is just as good I'll say.For some odd reason, everywhere else besides Orange County seems to be able to get Yunnan/Sichuanese food right. San Diego has awesome Sichuan cuisine and now we've found something in Vegas as well.We decided to try this place out after reading the reviews and I'll have to say, yelp didn't lead us astray!We started off with the appetizer buffet station where we got the ma la sliced beef and the tendon. I saw this table with a plate full of chilis so I asked the waitress what it was. She told me it was the 'spicy chicken'-- la zi ji. We got that cuz I wanted something super spicy. Then we got a dish for the young man, dried tofu with Chinese chives. I also like 'mi xien' a Yunnan speciality. Sichuan province and Yunnan province border each other so the food is similar --spicy as hell, mostly, featuring the Sichuan peppercorn.The la zi ji kicked my ass! I mean I can eat spicy foods -- ie habanero -- but man this spicy chicken was super spicy. Maybe because the entire dish was filled with dried chilis -- about 70% chilis to 30% chicken. I was glad I ordered the other stuff which contained no chilis to balance out our palate.When your mouth is in flames, take a few bites of the mi xien and drink a few sips of the broth. It really calms your mouth down.All in all, a really nice meal. The gals there were sweet and came around many times to make sure we were enjoying our meal. I would definitely come back here again!!
3	slow service, unique menu, VERY spicy food via over-roasted chili seeds===In the same way that Peet and Starbuck extract extra flavor by burning their beans, Yunnan uses a very oily (peanut-based) burned/blackened chili seed paste as the base for their dishes. Must admit I'm new to food from this province/style, but every dish seems to imitate the flavors of my nana's hottest salsa: lots of cilantro and red-hot peppers that leave your nerve endings twitching for relief.Other Yelpers weren't kidding that this is a destination for Chinese folks. We were the only non-Chinese people in the restaurant.SERVICE SO SLOW WE THOUGHT THEY'D MISSED THEIR MEAT DELIVERY...When we arrived we were seated in the corner and the server dropped the menus and hot tea. We then waited 30 minutes while three other parties arrived, were seated, their orders taken and their food delivered. Finally after a large 8-top next to us left, someone noticed us and came to take our order. We had started to wonder if the tea was a special arsenic blend and perhaps they had missed their New Year's meat delivery!After 20 minutes I thought we might flee, but with the order taken from the third table to arrive after us I just wanted to see what would happen... I am on vacation after all, and am not rushing anywhere (ah, what a feeling). When the girl finally came over and I asked her for a reality check, her quizzical look reminded me why the menu items are numbered -- no English here. "Thirty minutes" with a distraught look seemed to convey something because she bowed her head in shame and took two steps back. Freeze frame. Non verbals abound. Impressive.[aside] Sometime soon I want to do some research on cultural gestures of the body. Chinese take to pointing with a single finger, arm outstretched in a very quick motion -- think Godzilla. I noticed it standing in front of Notre Dame in Paris as hundreds of folks made this gesture at the 20-story monster in front of us that was the cathedral, as if there might be some mistake and they'd be looking at something else instead. This gesture contrasts the open-handed seemingly humble gesture of hospitality from Japan. Hmmm...  [end aside]Goddam this food is effing hot. The noodle soup is dark red because that's oily chili paste in there! Tofu has a single flavor -- HOT. Lamb is exactly the same. GODDAM. It's uncomfortable to the absolute maximum that the body can take without just wretching it out all over the table.I love it. What a burn! My scalp's every pore is pouring sweat down my neck and back and my nose is running faster than Usain Bolt in summer at Beijing. My face is on fire. My eyes are watering from the fumes wafting from what's left of my lips. My stomach is yelling bloody murder and threatening to take matters into its own hands with a promise that if I don't purge soon, the back-end burn will be at least as bad if not worse. Wow.At some point, I gave up before I lost consciousness and stumbled to the counter to pay the bill. "How was it?" they asked.My eyes widened as I drew a fiery breath, tears still streaming down my face, "OH! MY! GOD!"
4	Yun Nan Garden was brought to my attention courtesy of my fellow yelpers.  The Husband and I tried once before to check out this 'authentic' Chinese restaurant hidden away in the Spring Mountain area but arrived when it was closed.We were on a mission and had a (small) crowd with us.  Taking no reservations, the five of us arrived around 6:30 pm on a Friday night.  With plenty of tables available, the waitress seemed conflicted as to where to put us.  In the end, a round table in the middle was where we ended up.Our menu:   * Boiled Beef with Szechuan Sauce ($9.25) - Arriving in a large bowl, pretty tasty stuff that you need lots of white rice to eat with.  Lots of spice and oil, but pretty good and is amongst their specialties.* Wild Pepper Tofu ($7.85) - Soft tofu with lots of flavor and gravy.  Another good choice!* Eggplant in Garlic Sauce ($7.85) - Really good as well, although not the favorite of the bunch.  * Local Style Dry Pot Chicken ($9.25) - At least that's what I think we ordered...it arrived with a fire going on beneath it.  Others really enjoyed it, but it was okay to me.* A pork or chicken dish with green bell peppers - It was a good dish, without the gravy.  It had hidden heat amongst the green bell peppers because green chilies were hiding in the dish.I had low expectations on service, and you really don't come here for service.  No one spoke or understood any English, which was a major problem.  Only Mandarin speaking only!  We thought they forgot about a dish because it took so long, and we think they really did.  It eventually came out at the end.Our second visit was a party of five again and this was our menu:* Boiled Fish and Beef in Szechuan Special Sauce ($10.25) - Any of their "boiled" things in Szechuan special sauce is a good choice.* Wild Pepper Tofu ($7.85) * Local Style Dry Pot Chicken ($9.25) * Potato ($7.85) - The Husband saw a lot of people ordering this on our first visit, so we had to get it.  It's potato that's been stir-fried without the spice.  It's a light dish and we liked it so much that it inspired us to make it at home.  (It comes out different at home, more like Chinese-style hash browns when I do it!)* Sauteed (Garlic Sauce) Seasonal Vegetable ($7.85) - The vegetable was snow pea shoots which are always good when cooked with garlic.* Pork Intestines - Stir-fried with lots of veggies.  It was good, but we just ordered too much food this time around.Service was better the second time around, only because there was one waitress who spoke and understand English very well, AND she spoke Cantonese, which helped since my mom was there.  But everyone else who worked there just looked at us as if we were aliens whenever we tried to ask about anything.  I also had some problems getting my credit card receipt.  They gave me one to sign, but nothing to keep.  When I asked for it, it was a big deal to get a copy and I think it's because they really didn't understand that I just wanted my credit card receipt.Go with a large group so you can try more things.  One dish for every person should be an ample amount.  The food is pretty authentic and there's a definite heat in it.  Most diners are native Chinese and this place definitely fills up by 7:30 pm.  Just don't have any expectations with service or anyone speaking English.3.5 for really tasty and authentic Chinese food but negatives for crap service.(Pics posted!)
3	yum yum tasty tasty, portions on some items a little skimpy, and the wait staff is a little a-loof, however it's totally worth it. The foood is really cool, quite authentic, and a great place to get away from the Vegas strip for a bit. If you're into the Yun Nan Province food this is a great place to start.
2	Maybe this type of food is simply "too authentic" for my stomach to take.  I typically like my food "spicy" ... but not "oily" like that!  Went there with four of my girlfriends and let's say that maybe we were all too "Americanized" to appreciate the food.  The service was definitely lacking - I suppose maybe we insulted them by picking at our dishes instead of eating them.  In the end, we finally gave up.  "Boxes?" -- asked one of the servers.  Um,... we all looked at each other and said, "no thanks."  We paid for dinner and went down the streets to another restaurant to have "more" dinner.  :-(
4	A nice surprise in a hard to find location. It's located on a small street parallel to Spring Mt. Road, the long street that takes you the Wynn.  The street is basically the rear parking lot to the main strip of restaurants and is easy to miss.    Get the cha chang mien, stir fried bean curd, shredded pork in brown sauce (comes served atop a bed of cabbage), and the house special noodles and soup (item #1).  The chicken was gamy so I tossed it aside, but the broth was light and just right.  Everything else had me thinking I'd be back for another nice meal. Other reviewers were on the mark about the level of oil the restaurant uses on some dishes but it was tolerable. More authentic and out of the ordinary if you're willing to try a different menu. You won't find sweet and sour pork or walnut prawns here if you're craving Chinese Am.  But what a pleasant alternative in the middle of nowhere.
5	This place is still rock solid!  We ordered the garlic spareribs and were AMAZED at how good it was.  Imagine fried minced garlic that taste like mini croutons.  A heaping mound of it was tossed on top of the fried ribs.  I've never had anything like it.  I was shoveling spoonfuls of it into my mouth....
5	We ate here twice while on vacation. The kids loved the Number 1 noodle soup (and so did we!), hubby loved the garlic spareribs, and I loved the MaPoDoufu and DanDan Mian. The second time we came, we had a Sichuan native with us and while she insisted they were all from Guangdong, she liked the food. My daughter (5 yrs old and also from Sichuan) LOVED their cold spicy doufu appetizer! We'll be back again, unfortunately it's a 7hour drive...
4	After beginning our recent dinner at a nearby restaurant and knowing that we were going to leave unfulfilled, The Husband and I suggested Yun Nan Garden to our friend who is always curious to try something new.* Boiled Beef with Szechuan Sauce ($9.25) - We knew we wanted something with their specialty sauce, and we've ordered this dish twice before.  It's always been a winner, so why not go for it again.* Bean Curd Fish with Szechuan Special Spicy Sauce ($9.25) - We asked for a recommendation for fish, and the waiter suggested this one.  It has a very similar sauce as the beef dish, but it also has peanuts in it too.  Loads of spice again!* Home Style Potato ($7.85) - We wanted a potato dish and thought it was the same one we've ordered before where the potatoes are cut into strips and stir-fried.  This dish is different since the potatoes are sliced and boiled, it sits in a chicken broth with jalapenos.  It was good, especially against all the heat from the other dishes, but we wished we had gotten the other potato dish instead.When you eat at Yun Nan Garden, you have to be prepared for the heat.  Our friend said he liked spicy, but had no idea it was going to be this spicy!  Bring on the water and tissues!  And for anyone hoping to skip the rice, impossible here because you need the white base to slop all the spicy goodness to slurp up!Service was better this time.  A male waiter seated us and took our order.  Another girl brought our food, beverages, and our check over.  We had minimal contact with the wait staff this time, so maybe that worked in our favor.We had plenty of leftovers from the two spicy dishes, but then it  might be because our friend couldn't handle the heat! Haha!3.5 stars.
5	I like this place a lot.  Some folks on here seem to have gotten lousy service from people who didn't speak English, but everybody spoke pretty decent English both times I went.  The waitstaff seems to speak a lot of Mandarin, but I've heard a lot of patrons speaking what I think is Cantonese.  The owner's daughter, who speaks English without a touch of accent, was my waitress the second time, and she told me her family was from Yunnan province.  Anyway... food time.  The first thing I ate here was a huge bowl of catfish, beef, some vegetable that I think might have been Napa cabbage or something like that, tons of diced garlic in a thick broth, and a huge ladlefull of red chili oil on top.  It cost about $12 or $13 and it rocked my world.  I took the leftovers home and ate every drop.  I thought it was kind of similar to homestyle Thai or Laotian stews and soups. To get it I had to tell the waiter that I wanted something really good and really Chinese, something that he liked, and this was his recommendation.  The second time I ate here I got the lamb fire hot pot (about $12-$13), and it was also awesome, although the pieces of lamb were actually little chopped-up lamb ribs with only a little meat on each.  I'd say that there was only about 2 oz of actual lamb meat (and a whole ton of bones) in the whole thing, but it was still delicious.  Don't order any lamb dishes here unless they tell you they're going to give you real meat and not just bones.  The dish came in a bubbling hot pot with bean sprouts, essentially the same thick broth as the other dish, some really weird spice berry things that I couldn't identify but tasted great, cilantro, more chili oil, and some more odds and ends that made for a really unusual taste.  If it just had some more lamb I'd tell you to run out and get this thing right now.  I ate it all, of course.
5	Authentic Southwestern Chinese food. Try the boiled beef, it is awesome!
2	Very authentic southern Chinese food, meaning: particles of fatty meat and carbs and wilted veggies swimming in salty oil (more fat). This food trend is the reason for my eating absolutely nothing when I go to China, and this restaurant is the best representation of this trend I've ever tasted in Vegas (but then I haven't tasted around much, because I try to avoid such places). If you like eating more oil and salt than actual food, this place is probably the best in Vegas. Warning though: though it's not spicy enough for me, it's probably very spicy for most people.
5	I think I have to declare this the best non-dim sum Chinese restaurant in Vegas.  I went back in and had cumin beef and garlic spareribs.  The spareribs are a cool novelty.  Their flavor isn't exactly delicious, but they come amid a mountain of crazy-tasting bits of fried garlic with a strange carnival candy taste to them.  It's a fun dish, but I wouldn't order it again unless I wanted to show the novelty to a friend. The cumin beef, on the other hand, is a steel-toed boot full of flavor right up your tailbone.  I didn't realize anyone on earth would eat this much cumin... and it works!  It comes with tons of fresh cilantro, jalapenos, and garlic, and if you're a tough guy, you'll love it.  If not... go eat at Panda Express, you little sissy baby.
4	I had dinner here on 11 December 2009.  I had the Boiled Beef with Szechuan Sauce.  It was wonderful.  Finally, a Chinese restaurant that knows how to do hot/spicy food.I read previous reviews and I recommend doing what others have done--ladle some of the beef onto your rice, eat, and repeat.  When finished, you'll have a nice bowl of spicy "rice soup" that is a super way to finish a meal.Service was good.  The young servers seemed surprised that a caucasian would like the spicy food so much.  I will return and try some of their other, more exotic dishes.Thanks to fellow Yelpers for giving me a reason to stop here before going next door to see a play at the Las Vegas Little Theatre,
5	Yun Nan Garden could be an intimidating place for many people, thanks to its slightly hidden location and a menu that's not going to be familiar to those whose experience of Chinese food doesn't go much beyond Panda Express and General Tso. But Yun Nan Garden holds some of the best Chinese food in Las Vegas, and is well worth venturing out of your comfor zone for. The atmosphere really isn't anything to speak of, it's pretty typical Chinese restaurant stuff. Booze is, as far as I know, limited to cans of Budweiser. But you're here for the food, and really not much else. There are a few standard Chinese dishes on the menu, but go for the Sichuan/Yunnanese dishes. I recommend:- Chonqqinq chicken - this is my favorite. It's a pile of small pieces of deep-fried chicken served in a mound of Sichuan peppercorns and dried chilies. It's hot: you notice the kick with your first bite, but it's not too bad. Then your lips start to tingle and numb from the peppercorns, then your mouth catches fire from the chilies, delivering a satisfying burn and great flavor.- Dan dan noodles - a standby of Sichuan cuisine, with ground pork, preserved vegetables and chili oil over noodles.- Pea shoots sauteed in garlic - a nice change of pace from the heat and complex flavors of other dishes.Prices are excellent, most dishes are $10-12 or under. One warning, though: it's not the best place for vegetarians, or even pescatarians. There's meat and poultry lurking in a lot of the dishes. But all in all, it's a star of Spring Mountain.
4	The sichuan restaurant is hidden in the back of the center of spring mountain.  I love the spicy!  Some of the dishes are a little salty, but the flavors are rich and the spicy menu works up a sweat for me.The Yunan Cured Pork is delicious!  The moist ham-like pork is very tasty and I definitely recommend it.  The beef stew noodle soup has some nice heat and is great comfort food.  The cumin lamb is the spiciest dish I've tried.  Also the saltiest, but still great.The service is acceptable.  The staff was friendly, but the english was pretty limited so ordering involved some finger pointing at the menu.  The Yun Nan Garden is one of the spicier restaurants I've eaten at and is good place to go when you feel like going to a place that will light up your tongue a bit without losing anything on the flavor.
4	oohhhhh Yummy!  My spicy food friend Derek and I came here after work for dinner and we went for trying 3 dishes.  We absolutely wanted the lamb in spicy dry pot, and I convinced him to try potatoes with green pepper, and we also wanted eggplant.  We tried to order eggplant in spicy paste a few times, but the waitress just said "garlic sauce."  She asked if we liked spicy and oh yes, we do!The lamb pot had schezuan peppercorns which coated my mouth and tongue with a numbing sensation, and the jalepenos in the dishes were fresh (mmm), and it was very tasty.  We got complementary hot tea but no water.  The spice was legit but we survived nicely!The food came out very fast, the waitress spoke English, and it seemed very authentic.  I thought it was a cool place to try out and would give it a go again (Derek eyed the non-spicy smoked duck on the menu). See pics!!!
4	A cuisine that has recently started appearing on the Vegas food scene is Chinese Szechuan, and one of the first restaurants to start serving it was Yunnan Garden. Szechuan cooking is much spicier than food from other regions of China, yet traditionally, Szechuan cooking was not as pungent or as hot as it is today. I don't find Szechuan cuisine I've had to be nearly as hot as what I've had at Indian or Thai restaurants, so if you prefer milder foods you don't have to avoid this cuisine that sounds spicier than it is.The first dish that came to us today was the least impressive and least expensive, the Dan Dan Noodle ($5.95). It consisted of a sweet and overly salty sauce underneath a mound of noodles sprinkled with peanuts. You mix the noodles and sauce to combine, which you can somewhat do in a way that caters to your own preference for heavy or light dressing. The next dish to arrive was #156, sauteed seasonal vegetables with garlic sauce ($7.85, I'm not an expert on Chinese vegetables, but after looking at some pictures online I think what we had was Choy Sum). Though this generic 'seasonal vegetable' dish appears on most Chinese menus, you aren't quite sure what exactly what you'll be getting, and the degree of expertise used to prepare it can vary dramatically. This version was fantastic, with perfectly cooked vegetables, a light sauce that barely coated them, and excellent flavor. It's hard to tell where the flavor is coming from since there is barely any color, but I'm guessing there might be some MSG in there somewhere, judging by how shiny it was (Anthony Bourdain claims food gets glossier the further West you move due to the use of this magical ingredient. MSG produces a sensation on the tongue which can only be described as umami). Other than the fact that children and pregnant women should stay away from it, I'm not averse to the use of MSG. It's a pretty remarkable ingredient that can really add to a dish, however, it should be consumed in moderation and is usually considered culinary cheating. If the vegetables didn't have MSG, the Fish Fillet in Spicy House Special Sauce ($10.25, #57) that was our entree almost certainly did (see how shiny it is in my picture). I was totally willing to risk consuming the controversial ingredient, however, because the dish was great and a fantastic deal; the plate could easily have served four people with hearty appetites. Though seafood is not an integral part of Szechuan food, freshwater fish is, and there is an abundance of it on Yunnan's menu. This fish was flaky and moist, and the sauce was pungent, spicy, and rich with the color of chilies. I loved the use of crunchy fried soy beans on top and the bed of incredibly fresh soy bean sprouts underneath, but it was a bit oily. Despite the oil, I didn't feel stuffed, and despite the possible health risks, I would order it again.It's a little difficult to get your bearings when ordering at Yunnan Garden as the choices are numerous and the descriptions vague, but everything coming out of the kitchen looked pretty good. Don't count on much help deciphering from the waitstaff unless you speak the language, but if you stick to your personal preferences you should be fine. Just remember, don't bring the kids and leave the pregnant ladies at home. (Note: Many restaurants -not just Chinese- use MSG, and it is also present in a lot of processed snack foods because of its addictive qualities. I'm not trying to single out Yunnan Garden as a culprit.)Tip: The restaurant is difficult to find. The best way I can direct you is to go to the far back side of the one story strip mall between Valley View and Arville on the south side of Spring Mountain. It's part of that same set of buildings.
3	My Chinese fiance and I go here. The food is pretty good and passes her taste test.
3	This particular restaurant has locations in the LA area as well. I don't recall if I've ever been to any of the LA Locations.  Prettty standard for chinese food they have an area at the front with a bunch of small appetizers you can choose, but didn't order anything from that...ordered an Eggplant Dish and a Fish Dish...It was okay fully flavored maybe a bit too much...Nothing to write home about but pretty standard food to me.
2	12:30 Wednesday Nov 3.  Small place.  Friendly staff.  Did not let me know about the appetizer bar they have.  $4.50 for 3 cold appetizers.  They have a pot of tea for you as soon as u sit down.  I had their Shrimp Chow Mein, $9.00.  The waitress seemed a little concerned when i ordered that which scared me so i asked what she recommened and she said "this ok."  It was all noodles with green onion & yellow onion & half a dozen shrimp.  Nothing special.
1	We had dinner here a few weeks ago. We got the smoked duck and the eel sauteed with dry pepper. The duck tasted like ham and the eel had an unusual flavor that I did not care for.
4	I've only just found out about this place thru yelp, and I agree it's pretty good and authentic.  We ordered a lamb dish that came in a small pot, some fried shrimp, and mapo tofu...everything was delicious but SPICY.  I loved it!  We just drank more water and ate more rice with everything.It's a very cheap meal.  Also none of the waitresses seems to speak English.  We didn't care though because I'm not opposed to just pointing :-P
2	duck was super dry, the waiters didn't speak english and I think I could have cooked myself a better meal, which is not saying much
5	I asked the waitress how good is their Yunnan style rice noodle soup, she smiled and said,"It is the best in the US."  I have tried two from their list so far (not the first one though, as if No. 6 and 7?), they both taste pretty good.  Only con is, most staff don't speak much English.  Guess they get enough business from Chinese customers, good for them :)
4	I went here again, and had very similar items.  I love the fried shrimp so I ordered it again.  It's crunchy and so yummy...completely unhealthy for you, but I'm not really looking to eat healthy when I come here.  I also tried the beef dry pot since I like dry pots, and we all thought the beef one was better than the lamb (it's made the same way but we just like beef more).  The dry pot has bean sprouts at the bottom which I think makes a nice contrast to the spicy beef (it helps to lessen the spiciness and add a crunch).  As for the tofu dish, I ended up liking it as well, but it wasn't what I thought I had ordered.  It's completely my fault though since I don't speak mandarin or read Chinese.  I was thinking by the English description "fried tofu with pepper sauce" that it would be cubes of crunchy fried tofu with a dipping sauce on the side, not a stir-fry with vegetables.My only warning about this place is that if you are like me, and don't speak or read Chinese, you will find it more difficult to speak with the waitress and read the menu.  I'm ok with trying new things though so it's not a big deal to me.  Also you might feel a little uncomfortable among a full restaurant of Chinese speakers.  This time around, the waitress didn't say a single word to us, hehe, she didn't even try.  I don't care as long as the food comes and is yummy.
4	This is my favorite place for Chinese rice noodle.  It tastes just like the ones I had when I was little!  Service is fast.  The cold dishes are good as well! I come here every time when I visit Las Vegas.  It's definitely a must visit place for those who come from southwest China or if you just want to try some thing new!
4	perty freakin good.This is some good chinese food. The first time I went there and I found out that have those appetizer plates with 3 different meats for 5 bucks I was ecstatic! This place is so good! and the best part is that its hidden behind chinatown! They have really good chicken dishes, and beware if you want to eat there be prepared to eat spicy!Yun Nan China is well known for their spicy foods! so they can really make it tingle. just letting you guys know.but overall its a great place to eat, only downside, they close at 9pm. wtf is that right, especially if its vegas, cmon everything is open 24 hours.. apparently not..  but if you wanna just go grab some grub somewhere youve never been try Yun Nan,.. tasty tasty tasy
5	I'll keep it short: One of our favorite places to eat in Vegas. We come here 3-4 times a month.Service is better now that they have replaced the two college-aged girls. Those two were horrible. They never recognized you as a "regular" and you had to ask for everything.
3	I'll keep it short: Some of the best Chinese food I've ever had, so authentic and really feels like a well-kept secret since it's tucked in the back of the other shops.  Average service, not much to say on decor, but..OMG!  SPICY!  SPICY SPICY SPICY!  I normally can down just about anything, I LOVE Curry, but a third into my meal, I had to cry uncle, it was too much!  I was there on a first date and we couldn't stop laughing because our faces were bright red!  I even tried taking it home and eating it later that night with some yogurt and it burst into flames while eating it!   (Maybe it's a great date spot, all things considered, because you can just make small talk about how spicy everything was...)
5	This was some of the best Chinese food I've had in a while. This place is secretly tucked away inside the back of one of the Chinablocks in Las Vegas.The thing that I love about Chinese food is that there are so many different types of Chinese cuisine.Yun Nan Cuisine is extremely spicy and the peppers they use will actually make your tongue go numb. I didn't like it as much when I was younger but it has grown on me.My parents took me here one night when we visited Vegas and the dishes were made so well.The dish that stood out the most was surprisingly a simple Chinese vegetable dish. I could tell the Chef knew what he was doing. With real Wok experience, he brought out the "wok hei" or "wok qi" for my mandarin speaking friends.  If you have never experienced eating Chinese food embodied with wok hei then your missing out. Seriously wiki it and then come here and try the food. I hope the Chef is still flipping and frying that food, in that wok over an open flame because everyone should get a chance to eat quality Chinese food.
5	It doesn't get any better than this place.  If you really know good Chinese food, then you know that this is one of the top spots in Las Vegas or the West Coast.  This place tops any place I've been to in Seattle.If you are used to eating dumbed-down Chinese food for the "American palate", then you probably won't like it.  I suggest you try the Chinese restaurants that have a sign in front that says "Chinese and American Food".
4	Good food, great pig's ears. This place is something you'd find in LA. There's a small deli in the front where you can choose small plates/appetizers to share. Yunnan is known for it's rice noodles, and this place has some legit noodle soups. I ordered the beef tripe rice noodle soup as well as stir-fried bamboo and pork. It was pretty delicious. The prices are right and not expensive. If you're hungry for some legit noodle soup and cold appetizers, this place is it.
5	I do not know what I would do without Yelp!  How would ever I find this hidden gem on my own? Walked up to the cold counter, picked three items for a plate and was helped by the owner, Ivy.  Tried the fried tofu, garlic cukes and a chinese Kim Chee (wrong word but you get the idea).  Wifeypie and I were dripping from the Kim Chee and the tofu, and it got hotter when we stopped eating it!Ivy then came over to the table, inquired if we had been to the restaurant before and then proceeded to help us order, we had not a clue.  This smiling cheerful woman was a pleasure to share some time with.We ordered the number 1 rice noodle soup and number 55, Deep Fried Fish Filet Sauteed w/ Spicy Sauce.  The soup was very good, the fish was one of the best fish dishes I have ever had, SPECTACULAR!  After we ordered, Ivy brought over another plate from the cold cart, with dried fish with chili and peanuts, pork and beef tendon (I am guessing it was tendon from the texture) and seaweed salad.  Again, it was all delish!  This was her gift for us!I hope this place stays true to its roots in the future, we will definitely be coming back here on future trips to visit our money in LV!Thank you Yelp, thank you Ivy, and thank you whatsherface for picking Yun Nan Garden for lunch today!;-)
2	I went there on a Tuesday afternoon around 3pm.  It was full of Asian People and I thought this has to be good.  I ordered the Spicy Chicken just like the picture #42.  I was served hot tea and my order came in a reasonable time.  The chicken was cooked in a crunchy manner and it had a lot of red chili pepers (which I like) but I found the food way too dry and salty.  I asked the waiter if I could order some sauce to put on my food (and rice) and was told No.  I said the rice and chicken was rather dry and I would like to ordrer some sauce, any sauce, to top my order.  He brought me 3 packages of Soy Sauce.  I said the table already had soy sauce, vinagar sauce, and chili paste on the table, what I wanted was some sauce like a gravey to top my food and he said, "No Sauce".  I bagged my food and left.  I didn't feel the service was even close to adaquate.  I was under the impression that the place you eat at should accomadate your taste and wishes, I was eager to pay for some sort of sauce (gravey like) to top my dish and do not feel there was any attempt to accomadate my wishes.  From this experience, I will not probably ever eat there again.  All the other dishes that customers odered looked good and looked like authentic Chinese food.  I wanted this experience to be good, as I heard a lot of good things about this resturant, but I have  nothing good to say about my dining experience there on this occassion.
3	The cold dishes in front were great.  However, the plates that we ordered off the menu were just ok... on the oily and salty side.
4	So this is where all of the Chinese people have been hiding! At least the Chinese people who enjoy authentic delicious food!  We ordered the noodle soup and it was exactly what we were hoping for.  The spice level was numbing and the broth was so flavorful- just as we had experienced in the Yun Nan province.  This alone is a 5 star dish and I will definitely order it again and again. From the cold counter, we picked out some spicy cold beef, pig ear, and peanuts with dried anchovies-  to quiet our rumbling tummies while we waited for our order. It was the perfect appetizer and the heat in the beef prepped us for the spice level that was to come. We also ordered the spareribs in fried garlic, sauteed pea sprouts, and chicken fried rice.  These were pretty good as well- but obviously that noodle soup was the star.  The service wasn't the friendliest, but quick and efficient.  It is that numbing spice that is calling me back! I am so glad to have finally found a Chinese Restaurant that I can proudly take my in-laws when they are visiting from Hong Kong.
5	Awesome!  The best $20 you can spend in Vegas (for dinner for 2).We found this place on Yelp and dropped by around 7 o'clock on a Thursday.  It was packed and we grabbed the last available table.We surveyed the offerings on the cold buffet (3 for $4.50) and chose the pig ears, the beef tongue and chicken feet.  A very generous portion and all were delicious. For our mains, we had the "Boiled Beef and Fish in Szechuan Sauce," which is actually the classic Szechuan hot pot and an order of Dan Dan Mien (spicy noodles with ground meat).  We ordered both with maximum heat and they were both pretty spicy and absolutely delicious. Everyone in the restaurant was speaking Mandarin and all of the staff and 99% of the customers were obviously Chinese from the PRC.  This is no Taiwanese or Hong Kongese upscale dining experience.  It's an authentic PRC chow hall.  It was extremely loud and lively and pretty much exactly like being in this class of restaurant in China.Szechuan is my favorite province in China and although the food wasn't  quite up to what you'd get in Szechuan it was a pretty damn good facsimile.  We didn't bring our own beer but half the other tables did and I'd advise you to do the same.
5	What an amazing culinary experience I had in this off the beaten path restaurant, the dishes we order were authentic and flavored w such an amazing balance and kick. I must say this could become my favorite Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas, I haven't had this good of a culinary time since Shanghai noon closed is doors. If you don't know what to order from the vast menu just ask the friendly staff and they will help you select some great food. Njoy
5	Solid choice for Chinese food, which specializes in Yunnan regional cooking, but their other dishes are solid as well.  The #1 item is the signature, which is Yunnan chicken noodle soup - and you'll find the story on the cover of the takeout menu.  Tasty.Dan Dan noodles are best I've had this side of the Pacific.  This place does not disappoint.
4	The food is still very good, but the place is getting way over-crowded.  We have been coming here for several years now.  However, in the past year, this place has had an explosion of popularity.  The most troubling part are the buses.  I mean greyline big buses.    When one leaves another arrives filled with Chinese tourists.Tonight is the first time we have made the trip there and there was a long-line coming out the door.  A year+ ago, there was never a problem of getting in almost immediately any day of the week.The food is still the best.  I cannot recommend this place enough for the food, but be prepared to wait, and get seated at a common table.
4	Had been here for a lot of times but it is the first time to review.I have to say it is one of the most popular Chinese Restaurant in Vegas.  Beef rice noodle is very good and it is not that spicy.My recent favorite is Suan Tang Yang Rou -- which is the lamb soup with a spicy and sour taste --really good for winter time!I also love Ye shan jiao ji za or Ye shan jiao rou si -- this is really spicy because of a special and preserved pepper in it...but I LOVE spicy food as my home town is actually not far away from Yun Nan. :DHome style Tofu is good, too.  It is not that Spicy.Try Xiang La Xiao Yang Pai -- it is crispy and spicy.Beijing Yogurt is very popular!  I bet most Chinese people miss this flavor from their childhood...To me, it tastes much better than almost all the American yogurt here! Anyway, it is a place we usually go if we do not want to cook Chinese food by ourselves.  It is really good for 2 people to spend like $30 for a dinner and we do pack away for the next day too! lol
5	I heard that they make really good noodles, and I have to agree. Plus, all their noodle dishes are under $9. I'm not surprised that they get really long lines every night.
3	3.75 stars for now. I had a few dishes I didn't like but I'm addicted to the ones I liked.I took 4 tums today and my stomach (and anus) is still on fire. This was my first experience with Szechuan food and by the end of dinner I concluded that I liked it. I also learned that (1) I should bring a Chinese friend and (2) should order non-spicy items to balance out the meal. Our group of four ordered 8 dishes + appetizer and I ordered 4 of them (fatty, I know!). 1. Fish fillet and tofu in spicy soup - Tasted like fire. I love spicy but not when there is no flavor to it but fire. Didn't even take the left overs home.2. Fish fillet in house special sauce - Spicy but flavorful! This plate is HUGE. I think it's about 4 servings.3. Pork spare ribs - Sweet, spicy, crunchy, fried, fatty! This was one of my favorite dishes. Must try! Be careful of the small pieces of bone though.4. Chicken with onions - A Chinese dish you can find at Panda (but superior). Enjoyed it even though it was mild! And the onions were sauteed perfectly.5. Dumplings (spicy) - Mediocre, I wouldn't get it again.6. Lamb (spicy) - I liked it. The flavors tasted to the Beef dry pot. The only difference was the lamb has more of a distinguished taste. 7. Beef dry pot (spicy) - I liked this dish because it incorporated vegetables but IMO it looked better than it tasted.8. #1 noodles in egg soup - The waitress recommended this noodle this as their most popular one. It's not spicy (which is fine) but the soup was somewhat bland. One of my friends used the soup to rinse off spice from the other dishes. Even though I didn't love the soup, I'm willing to try a different noodle dish because quality of the noodles were pretty spectacular. 9. Appetizer - Cold items: Tofu, Seaweed, and Beef. Out of the three, the tofu was the best. It was thinly sliced with nice salty taste. The beef resembled very thinly sliced beef jerky. It was good but it wasn't so memorable. The strings of seaweed reminded me of a Korean side dish. To be honest I'm biased because I don't really like the Korean version of the seaweed so obviously I didn't really like the Chinese version either.
5	BEST CHINESE IN VEGAS. When all the Chinese tour buses drop off their passengers at Yun Nan, you know this place is good.FOOD: Chinese restaurants in Vegas are either unauthentic, too salty, or leave a bad taste in my mouth. Yun Nan is authentic and will kick your butt with flavor. There is so much to choose from; the menu is huge! I haven't had the opportunity to try more than a few dishes. The Noodle dishes I could live without.... but their Mapo Tofu is the best in town and their white fish seafood dishes are ALL delicious.SERVICE: The service isn't bad. Its just hard to communicate with the waitresses. They don't speak a lot of English. If you can't speak Mandarin... just order using the numbers. CREDIT CARDS: Minimum $20
5	One of the hundred best Chinese restaurants in America. Not once, but twice. I can definitely see why after a quick lunch. For two, an order of their Eggplant in Spicy Sauce and House Style Spicy Lamb was enough for two meals. Now, I don't mean for it to sound like throwing an abundance of food on a plate makes it good. There are plenty of restaurants where it is quite the opposite. Not at Yun Nan Garden though. My friend and I were both pleased with our meal. All the veggies maintained and kept their textural integrity. The lamb was tender and kept it's promise of heat. The eggplant was oily, but the flavor was complex. It was not spicy and made me think that they gave us the Eggplant in Garlic Sauce. Either way, I loved the meal. They do not have any lunch specials, but the prices are low. Most dishes hover around $7-$12. Our bill came to $22 before tip. For two meals, I would say that is a win.
4	My family enjoys szechuan a lot, and this restaurant, though not the best we've ever been to, is one of the best in Las Vegas.  We first ordered a bowl of their well known noodle soup.  This rice noodle soup did not strike me as being that special.  It just wasn't that particularly flavorful...but everyone else around us had a bowl, and they seemed to enjoy it.  Next we had the soft tofu with fish in szechuan sauce.  I enjoyed it...I'd say the intensity is dulled a bit, but the flavor is still there.  This dish was an enjoyable departure from our usual fish in chili broth.  I think my favorite dish though was a completely non spicy dish:  bitter melon with eggs.  In Yun Nan's version, they stir fried the egg separately with the bitter melon.  The melon was not overly bitter, and so very palatable.  Our second noodle dish was the cold noodles in szechuan sauce (?)...nothing really special, though the noodles were very chewy.  Next time I will try the dan dan noodles.The service was very prompt with all the dishes coming out rather quickly and at once.  The ambience and location were nothing to note, but the food is good enough for us to return in the future.
2	Authentic Yunnan province food. So authentic no one speaks English.  The Menu is translated very poorly, there are no descriptions of the type of beef or chicken or what ever it is you're ordering. Don't expect them to have egg rolls or fried wantons. And whats more they don't even carry Chinese beer, they only have Heineken. Say what?  The waitress was very rude, but that's expected. Go somewhere else, go next door, its delicious and they help you with the menu.
5	Wow was extremely surprised at how good this place was.  It is a little hard to find its behind the plaza with Lee's Sandwiches and Pho Kim Long.  It has about 15 tables and is well suited for groups as some of the tables have a dish carousel in the middle. The food is some the best Chinese food I have had in the US, even the tea was good. This is as authentic as you'll find.   The service was extremely good and our food came out quickly.  I highly recommend the Mapo Tofu, Lamb with Cumin and house special fried rice.  This place is a must try.
4	When you can find authentic Chinese food, Szechuan food to boot, it's a place that you should always remember as a go-to. This cuisine is effing delicious and little havens like this restaurant just aren't too many places.Not only are they rare, but to experience the food well you really need to be open to new experiences and have someone there who speaks Chinese. It's hard to thrive otherwise.Anyways, what kind of food can you expect? Well ... let your Chinese friend handle it or go with anything with noodles (they're made in-house) and order some of the cold plates at the counter to start.My absolute favorite dish was the Szechuan style spicy fish soup. Get some rice to eat with it and you have some TASTY stuff. Order this even if your Chinese friend doesn't want to.If you're in Vegas for vacay you'll probably be busy with restaurants on the strip. But if you want something different then come here.
5	Since last night was my fourth visit to Yun Nan Garden I suppose it is time for a review.  This may be my very favorite Chinese Restaurant.  One of their signature dishes is a famous noodle called Crossing Bridge Rice Noodle that is named from a famous legend of a woman who walked a long distance crossing a bridge to bring her husband lunch and discovered a way to keep the broth warm and cook the noodles and thin meats to have the dish taste fresh when she served it to him.As soon as you are assigned a table go to the appetizer counter and select three items which they will put on a plate for you.  I highly recommend the baked tofu, chopped pickled long beans, and peanuts with dried fish.  Don't worry about the spice, my friend with the delicate palate was fine.For entrees stick with food from the Sichuan or Yunnan region.  These are their specialties.  Be prepared for flavors you have never experienced.  This is a must in Las Vegas, even if it does mean you have to get in a cab and leave the strip.  If you go for dinner, the prices will more than compensate for the cab ride.
4	Good, know what they cooking. you will hate panda express after this.
5	U can actually call their Kung Pao chicken...... Kung PAO CHICKen. Not Americanized at all, the best spicy Chinese food place in Vegas.
2	Went here and tried a couple of different dishes. Was really average and the service was bad. I had the eel soup and .. something else. See I forgot it already. It was breakfast time and I was less than impressed with the food or service. Mayne I caught them at a bad time or something. I see some stellar reviews on here and I just didn't get anything worth going back for.
4	It's starting to become a must eat location before leaving vegas.  Szechuan cuisine is on the spicy side, so beware before going here.We usually get the boiled fish and the eggplant in spicy sauce; both are packed with flavor that tastes so good that it hurts...  My friends eat it with rice but I opt for the carbless version and just eat meat and veggies.The only thing about it is the typical service you would expect from an Asian restaurant.
4	The food is great here and authentic.The Yunan noodle soup here is not bad at all.My pet peeve with this place is that the owner of this restaurant keeps all the tips, not the waitress.One of the owner, the older lady works as cashier/waitree is the one takes all the tips. I think she is also the wife to one of the owners. That is why you don't see her do too much work.I learned this after I went to eat with one of my friend, and she knows one of the former waitress that used to work there.That is why you would get substandard service there, and what the restaurant is doing is deceiving to the customers.
3	Located in the China town just a hop away from the strip (u do need to drive there).  Had our last meal in vegas last Saturday  here as a family.  We ordered medium spicy periwinkle for me, pot stickers for my older son, Yun Nan rice noodle with chicken for me also, beef with black bean sauce for my husband, and tomato egg (not on the menu) for my younger son.  Everything tasted ok to good to me, we all had our fill for Chinese at the end except my younger one who was the picky eater for the night.They are not related to the one in Temple City on Las Tunas according to the old waiter,  even though the name is the same.  The menu is very different also.  Overall, the food was decent but not great.  The "over the bridge" rice noodle or "guo qiao mi xian" as in Chinese is not authentic in taste at all.  I've had this so many times to know the taste was off right away.  It could be passed off as " guo qiao mi xian" to the less experienced palette, but it didn't quite nail the nuanced balance of meat, aromatics, and body.I didn't try the pot stickers, but judging from my older son's swift action, I know it must be edible.  But then again he is such an easy kid, when he's hungry he pretty much tolerates any food except the sea food. The beef with black bean sauce was ok but not great.  The periwinkle dish was pretty good.  The tomato egg is little bit on the salty side and too oily for my taste.  Overall it was an ok place.  No service, no water on the table either just a pot of tea which is not what I wanted at 10pm at night.  Medium portion compare with some of the Chinese restaurants in LA.  But the price is not too high for Vegas.  Owners don't speak English.With tax, tip and my hubby's beer, the bill was under $100.  Not too bad for Vegas.
4	Nicely spicy, authentic Sichuan-style food. We had the Ma Po Tofu twice and it was perfect the first time, but overly salty the second--inconsistent. The salty food is still good, but needs to be toned down with a lot of rice. The Yunnan noodle soup is OK, not amazing. Do try the cold appetizers! And if you like fresh greens, ask the server about the seasonal Chinese veggies which aren't on the menu.
5	I went to Vegas for a conference last month. It was pretty convenient to get to the restaurant from the Strip. The bus stop was outside of the Venetian Palazzo hotel and the China town was 3 stops away. For $3, you can get a round-trip.The food in Yun Nan Garden is definitely authentic. I love their noodle soup. I also tried the Beijing yogurt and their small plates. You can order 3 appetizers on a small plate. I picked spicy beef, duck and a veggie dish. All were delicious and absolutely authentic.
5	Yun Nan Gardens is in a remote area but once you find this treasure box of a restaurant, you'll really love this place. this kind of restaurant is definitely for the adventurous and the foodies trying to explore. My family and I came here on a whim, and now we are hooked.  i highly suggest this place if you still want to have a good time in Vegas by still having some cash in your pockets. this restaurant is a nice change from the buffets and the fast food in and around the strip.  this place is awesome because the food here is delicious. i would suggest some items but i only know them in chinese. but the point is to be adventurous and try something new.
4	This place is a gem for spicy food lovers.  Been here twice on my Vegas trips and all the dishes I have tried did not disappoint! Can be packed at times but they serve fast. Go hungry to fill up your stomach with yummy food!
5	Authentic Chinese spicy food. when I say spicy, I mean it. The heat here is not for the faint of heart. Everything is very good. I would recommend bringing a Chinese friend to help navigate the menu.
4	this is the BEST CHINESE FOOD IN LAS VEGAS i had so far. if you're a spice lover this is the place to go. we ordered two dish (2 of us): liang mein and fried spicy chicken. both were so delicious we order 2 more dishes to take home. ma po tofu and dan dan mein, both tasted even better !! this place is amazing and will definitely go back !!but be warned: the wait staff don't speak english well....but how much more authentic can you get ? :) (they do have pictures in the menu so you can just point, for all you only english speaking customers)
5	We came here based on the Yelp rating and weren't disappointed.  You WILL stand out if you're anything but native Chinese coming here to eat, but push through that and you'll be rewarded with great food.  We order by the number (as someone else's review suggested) and were enjoyed stir fried lamb (with jalapenos and peppers!), white rice, and pork chow mein.  It was all grand stuff!  Maybe next time we go we'll go in a crowd (it was just me and the wife) and bring our Chinese-speaking friend with us.
5	By far one of the best Chinese food I've eaten, ever. SF/LA, got nothing on this place. Foods great, spice and flavor is amazing. Very quant and low key spot, you definitely need to know where your going to find it, in the "back alleys" but worth it when you find it.
4	I love, love, love this place...A  small hard to find hole in the wall place in China Town in Las Vegas but if you are willing to look it is not a hole in the wall and not that hard to find!  The decor is nice neat and the service is competent and polite for hard core China Town.  I don't mind having a fake smile greeting for great authentic food.  This is one of the places  I find it...This is authentic Northern Chinese food so if you do not like spice please avoid because most of it is hot hot hot.  However if you like heat and you know the difference between Hot and Burn your face off, hot v/s spice is the question.  This place uses chillies, peppers, veggies and spice to create a perfect balance of flavor.  Don't get me wrong it is HOT but it also has flavor any HOT person will love this place I personally LOVE it as much as my stomach and intestines will allow it.  My father in-law whose glasses steamed up and sweat running off his face, also claimed he love hot but after clarified not hot but spice will disagree with me.  So, know your spice, and love every minute of this place!  We got the Spicy White Fish, some days it is very deep fried most days it is nicely deep fried The Cumin Lamb is our favorite.  I look forward to trying some veggies after reading other reviews asian veggies are my favorite and will forgo other options some days for the best veggies!Can't wait to come back...
5	This hole in the wall defines fantastic Northern Chinese cuisine.  I was brought here by an in-the-know Chinese woman, and she laughed at the fact I was the lone "round eye" in the place.  A tour bus full of National Chinese had all the other tables.  I have never had better tofu-based dishes, loaded up with fresh Chinese greens, garlic, pea nuts, onions and chile flakes.  Just an intense flavor bomb.  Better still, thin strips of pig's ear, the preferred source of porky goodness.  Do yourself a favor and dive deep here.  The seven dishes we had were a miracle in highlighting the nuanced joy of eating this cuisine.
5	FoodImportant Note - The food is Northern Chinese (Szechuan) so it is SPICY.  Yes, that spicy.  But it is a good spicy as you can taste the flavors of the food, not just the spiciness.  I was kind of lost in the menu since I didn't know most of the dishes.  It is not your "typical Chinese American food".  If you are looking for typical Chinese American food, this is not the place for you.  However, if you like to try something new, I would highly recommend it.  I must confess that I don't remember what I ordered, but it was really good (and spicy).  The prices are reasonable.  Most dishes are around $10.If you like spicy food, I would rate it a must try (10/10).  If you can handle some spicy food, it is worth a try (8/10).  If you don't like spicy food, go to Panda Express.The service was good and the waitress was friendly.  She was very patient as we didn't know what to order, but she kept checking on us.  10/10.LocationThe restaurant is located off the strip, but not too far away (maybe 1-2 miles).  If you have a car, its no problem.  If you don't it could be a problem.  The restaurant had a homely feel.  It is in a newer building, otherwise I would call it a hole in the wall restaurant.
3	3 1/2  stars. It's hard to believe that I've been coming to LV for years and never visited this place. Located just south of Spring Mountain. Parking was no problem finding.The patrons - all Asian and yes the vans of tourist filled the place even during the evening. My order the cumin lamb and garlic eggplant. The lamb was spicy but not excessive, the eggplant was flavorful but had to much chili oil and overcooked. I couldn't even eat a third of the dish.The service was decent, I haven't giving up on Yun Nam. I'll return again a try some other dishes next time..
5	We came looking for Dong Ting Springs Hunan restaurant, a favorite restaurant of ours; however, it's no longer in existence. We entered this restaurant, located right next door to the former Dong Ting Springs, on a whim. My heart sank when I saw the steam table on the left. There was a group of Caucasians at a large table eating chow mein and fried rice. Too late to beat a retreat so we sat down. We noticed that the other patrons were Asian and NOT eating chow mein and fried rice. We were relieved to see the extensive menus populated by authentic Szechuan and other regional specialties. We ordered the lamb chops with pepper, garlic eggplant, some sort of spicy noodle soup dish with won tons, and the smoked duck. Our selections were cooked to order and did not come from the steam table. They were delicious and strongly flavored. Why would anybody come in here and order chow mein and fried rice?The service was prompt and attentive and a couple of the waitresses spoke pretty good English. There were specials on the white board, but they were written in Chinese. The waitress described one item as kidneys and pointed to her sides. There are frog and eel dishes, along with intestines, pig ears, etc. We noticed the regulars ordering some sort of noodle dish which was listed as item number one on the menu. Some regulars also ordered take-outs from the steam table. We highly recommend this restaurant for its authenticity, prompt service, delicious foods cooked to order, and English-speaking waitresses. We will definitely return.
5	I was so happy to find this place 5 years ago and I have been coming ever since! They have the most authentic yunnan rice noodles! (Guo quio mi xian). My family is from the yunnan province of china so I am use to the home cooked dishes! The yunnan noodles are nothing compared to kunmings noodles but it's close enough!
5	Hahaha! Most of the reviews here with less than four stars are obviously written by people who have NO IDEA what REAL Chinese food is about. They were apparently disappointed that they didn't find some Americanized version of Hong Kong style dishes that have been sitting under heat lamps in buffet trays the entire day, cooked with corn-starched shrimp, steamed vegetables and garlic loaded sloppy noodles. This is an INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH Chinese restaurant..as one reviewer here said "a PRC chow hall." The food, ambience and service are just like any dining experience you would have in Beijing, Nanjing or Hangzhou. NO Guandonghua spoken here! Loud, busy,crowded and energetic with AWESOME food that will knock you on your ass. Go ahead and WHINE about how its too small, its not easy to find on a main drag, you have to wait too long for a table, the decor isn't fetching enough or the menus  are mostly in CHINESE; blah, blah, blah. WHO CARES? The FOOD here is the main event (isn't that why you go out to eat at restaurants in the first place?, DUH!) and WHAT an EVENT it is! Yeah, it's spicy with lots of chili and chili oil...but its all FRESH: the MOST authentic and creative Chinese food I have expereinced anywhere outside of Mainland China. On top of everything else...it's ONE HECK OF A DEAL: our dining party of six ordered two appetizers from the cold counter, 10 main dishes and two rice plates. The total tab was still LESS than $100. For the uninitiated, certainly worth at least one trip to see how its done in the old country because if you have not yet experienced it, you won't understand.....It doesn't get any better than this...THE REAL DEAL!
5	Yun Nan is a wonderful Sichuan restaurant.  Great selection of flavorful and spicy dishes...more delicious and authentic than any Chinese restaurant on the strip, and inexpensive too!The best dishes we ordered at Yun Nan:Mapo TofuDan Dan MienSalt and Pepper ShrimpThe mapo tofu was one of the best I've ever had, great flavor, perfectly spicy and just great dish here.  The Dan Dan Mien was also delicious with sesame paste, pork, and noodles.  The salt and pepper shrimp was very addicting...we ordered two plates of all three dishes.This place is great for large groups, service is friendly, and is one of the best cheap eats in Vegas.
5	Awesome!Had a friend vising town and staying at the Rio, so we wanted to have lunch somewhere close, and Chinese food was requested.  Of course I Yelped it, and this place came up with high marks.Amazing menu with so many items you never see on the "Americanized" version of so many menus.  Don't worry, for those who love the same ol' standard, they have all those items as well, but there was frog, dried fish, whole fish, tripe, and all kinds of amazing sounding dishes I wanted to try.I love the photo inserts of the house special dishes.  Although I really wanted to order 10 things, we decided on 2 dishes.  Spicy lamb with cumin which was phenomenal!  And guess what?......it was SPICY!!!!  Thank you Yun Nan for making the dish how it's supposed to be and not downgrading the spice levels because of some fear to upset the obviously out of place diner!  I love it!  Also had shrimp with snow peas which was absolutely perfect!  Firm very fresh shrimp in a light sauce and wonderful fresh and crisp snow peas that barely hit the wok!This is a great little spot and I will be here many times to come!  My new favorite Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas!
4	Okay I've upped my rating of Yun Nan Garden. Arrived on a cold evening so spicy food sounded good.Started off with complimentary hot tea and followed with mapo tofu, spicy shredded pork and boiled fish stew. The fish reminded me of a dish I experienced in Beijing and was tender, included napa cabbage@ and was tasty. The mapo tofu and shredded pork were just as yummy and the portions were decent.The waitress who was younger and from northern China was friendly, spoke good English and had only been in the US for a few months. We had good conversation and she was efficient.I'm looking forward to returning here in the future.
5	This is the real deal. It is mobbed with hungry Chinese people for a reason. We recommend the fish with garlic and lamb stir fry. Great balance of seasoning and fresh ingredients, as good as I have tried on this side of the Pacific.
5	Had to write an update and correction. This is neither a Sichuan nor a Szechuan restaurant as I had concluded earlier. A knowledgable friend pointed out that it is a Yunnan restaurant, featuring dishes from a province by the same name in southwestern China. The steam table that I mentioned earlier actually sells dishes typical of this region and the regulars actually order items from the steam table as appetizers along with the main dishes. Items on the steam table include duck heads, chicken feet, thinly sliced tendons, vegetables, thinly sliced pork, peanuts fried with what looked like white bait and shallots, etc, etc. What the regulars do is order items from the menu then walk over to the steam table and order items from the steam table in small plates to share. Another popular dish with the Chinese regulars is a noodle dish with a clear chicken broth accompanied by thinly sliced meats and vegetables on the side which one adds to the noodles. Almost every table would start off by sharing this noodle dish before going to the other dishes. We tried it and it is really good. There is a picture of it in the menu.
5	I fall in love with the tasty and spicy food there once I visited... I went to it the second night again... I am from Yunnan, the rice noodles, cold dish combo and many others Sichuan and Yunnan food are 100% authentic!!!Love the spicy boiled fished and beef stew! and rice noodles.If you wanna try un-americanized Chinese food, Yan Nan Garden is the top recommendation!
5	I was in Las Vegas for a convention, with colleagues from China. One of the biggest complaints that I hear from Chinese travellers in America is about the quality of the food in restaurants. I set myself a challenge to find a restaurant in Vegas that would serve the same quality of food that can be found across China, and I was extremely pleased to discover Yun Nan Garden... If you want to eat authentic Chinese food, this restaurant is highly recommended! My colleagues had all been to Las Vegas several times, and were very sceptical at first. As soon as the food arrived I could see the smiles appear, and everyone started making comments about how good the food looked and tasted.We ordered a full table of food: A wide range of spicy eggplant, duck, pork, and lamb dishes, and everything was very good (the mapo tofu was particularly excellent). The restaurant is small, and off the main road, but more importantly it's clean and the service is very good. There were only two English speaking westerners in the restaurant when we arrived, but they were well served so there's no need to take Mandarin lessons before going!
5	Have you never ever try this place?If the answer is no ---- man! you should stop by and at least get their traditional noodleIf the answer is yes --- try some dishes different every time u come, they have many many many delicious spicy fooddddddd!
5	I have been to many Chinese food spots in town, and this place blows them away!Reason why?  My personal reasons...I prefer Vietnamese food when I crave fresh, Japanese food when I want flavor, and Thai food when I want spice and depth.  Yunnan delivers on ALL three!We tried the stir fried Eel with dry pepper....the eel was very flavorful and the dish was spicy!  It had a nice consistency and tons and tons of taste going on!  The portion was huge and they did not skimp out on the goods!   Check out the pic :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yun-nan-garden-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#roxUo3o8u3yg7px8D7wgawHad the salt and pepper shrimp, and it was good, just thought it would be full head on and done a little differently.  Also thought they would/should have been larger at $12-13 for the plate.  I wouldn't order these again, unless I can specify that I want head/shell on.  Pic :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yun-nan-garden-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#7M6BnswF5BV-esTvISeL8gLastly, tried some fried egg and green onion dish.  It was light and flavorful.  Wanted something that wasn't spicy, and this filled in well.  Also a generous portion and inexpensive.Service is typical authentic Asian.  Just friendly wave if you need anything and you will get it fast....just don't expect service like you would in an American establishment (auto/fill drinks, check on food, getting bill etc), and you will have a great time.I WILL be back again.  Even their non spicy dishes are packed with taste, and blow away any other spots I have tried in town thus far (Chinese food wise).
2	Ordered garlic spare ribs to go in the hopes they would be like another restaurant's fried garlic spare ribs, but alas  I was grossed out by their rendition.The little chewy, fatty pieces of pork deep fried in a strange batter with flecks of MSG buried in tasteless pseudo garlic-like crumbs was terrible. At least my dogs enjoyed it.
4	good foodif you are a spicy lover, this will be a good place for you.service could be better, the waitress acted like someone died... :(
5	Absolutely great!
4	I had a roommate several years back who hailed from the Szechwan Province of China. He would cook up some of the tastiest food, I'll have to say - best roommate ever. Of course, I could barely feel my tongue after enjoying some of his dishes, but boy did it taste good.Now if you are a mid-western white boy like myself, you may have noticed that some of the fine dining establishments in Chinatown will ask you, point blank, if you are certain you want it spicy. I could just be imagining this, maybe they actually ask everybody that (not just white boys), but I secretly suspect that they are always taking it down a notch on the heat level, to protect me from myself - and they are probably right in doing so.Of course, this is not the case at Yun Nan Garden - they always bring the pain.Last time I was there, my buddy and I ordered the beef stir fry and the lamb stir fry (local style). First of all the lamb was amazing, absolutely blew me away - I could have eaten another order. It was spicy (very spicy actually), but not when compared to the beef. They must have cut up 3 or 4 whole jalapenos and at least a dozen or more Thai chilies in that beef stir fry - holy hulking jalapenos batman, it was hot. Oh but it was sooo tasty.I suspect the location of this place has something to do with it, but they never ask me how hot I want it or if I'm sure I want to go with this or that option. Maybe being of the beaten path makes it less of a touristy place and so they figure I must know what I'm doing if I ended up here. This place is worth hunting for and do not deny yourself the lamb, but I would recommend asking for a pitcher of water up front - something I plan on doing next time.
4	Went to Vegas with my family and we simply got tired of all the buffets.  Thus, we thought it would best to get some "home made" Chinese food. What could be more homely then spicy food, right?  This place really hit the spot.  The crispy chicken was great.  It tasted like eating cracklings.   Service was slightly above average.  The only complaint is with the pig intestine.   There was a slight taste of the pig's business end in the dish.
5	2 words describe my experience at Yunnan: pleasantly surprising. I'm half-Chinese and I'm very picky when it comes to Chinese food and Americanized "Chinese" food makes me sad.A lot of Chinese people told me about this place but I've been putting off giving this place a try since I heard most of the items on their menu is spicy. I don't do spicy.I was browsing through the menu and sure enough, 90% of the items on the menu had not one, but two peppers next to their name! Yikes! I saw the spare ribs with garlic didn't have the two pepper symbols and I love garlic so I chose that. The garlic was minced and crispy fried and the flavor was just great covering the spare ribs. I sprinkled the fried garlic on the other dishes we got including the MaPo tofu. I think tofu is the only thing I don't mind eating spicy. It was good and it took several bites before my nose started running.The shocker on the menu was the Chongqing Spicy Chicken. The big plate was at least 50% red peppers. I was very afraid and highly intimidated until I tried a small piece of chicken. The chicken was lightly breaded, fried and super crispy. Reminds me of my Chinese grandmother's fried chicken. To my surprise, it wasn't spicy. I mean, there was a bite to it but not a kick. It was absolutely delicious and enjoyable. This was my favorite out of the dishes we tried and I'll get this again.The service was ok. A lick of Chinese might help you a lot. I was watching and listening to Shawn and our server's interaction and it wore me out!
4	when you combine many many many bottles of soju, vodka and friends, you are bound to wake up the next morning with a wicked hangover. a definite sign that you are no longer in your 20s. the cure? even if it's 100+ degrees out, for me it'll always be a piping hot bowl of soup with noodles. what i ate:- cold app plate: seaweed, pig ears, cucumbers: you pick three! just go up to the cold table display. i cant tell you what else they offered because i was too tired to move from the table. everything was good! super garlicky with a nice big of heat in the end, true to the szechwan style- house special noodle soup (i think #2 on menu?): if youre too eager to drink the soup, you WILL burn yourself! it's THAT hot. the broth is clear, and delicate in flavor. not too heavy or spicy to make your already hungover stomach hurt. i think my friends and i spent the entire meal with our faces getting a nice steam bath from our soups and not talking at all. we kept slurping hoping it would melt away our hangover.pros:- house special noodle soup! hot enough to get a sweat going, but the cure for my hangover. - service: for an asian restaurant they were pretty nice- mom n pop feel- almost all the patrons were asian - always a good sign- price: cheap!cons:- if youre not a fan of spicy food, this place isnt for youwould i come again? yes, even without being hungover.
5	Went to Yun Nan based on reviews here, and it was totally worth it. The food was very tasty, inexpensive, and prepared quickly. We were probably the only non-Chinese in there on a week night, which was definitely a good sign. The food was quite spicy, but tolerable if you're used to it. In fact, if I went back, I'd probably get a spicier dish. We has some spicy garlic shrimp, noodles, spicy tofu, and a very nice cilantro-filled soup. They made some plain noodles for my flavor-averse son. Certainly a refreshing break from the fatty, bland crap typically available on the strip. This place is worth it if you like a good Chinatown-type restaurant.
3	So, my friend and I decided to try this place because we wanted to try Szechuan food. The servers weren't fluent in English, so it made things hard to order at times. We ordered the bean curd pork and boiled spicy chicken. We liked the bean curd pork and spicy chicken. The food is good but i'm giving it 3 stars because of our difficulties with the servers.
4	Nice
4	I've been here once a long while ago and remember it to be good. I came for lunch with Elnino F. They have a to-go looking stand to the left where they offer various cold salad appetizers. You can pick 3, for $4.5 I think is a good deal. We got braised tofu which was nicely spicy, a good but standard seaweed salad, and a sliced chicken gizzard salad which was nicely fragrant. We got: Spicy Chicken Dry Pot - they asked if we want with or without bone. Normally bone makes for better flavor so we opted, but it made for some work. They chopped up chicken wings and fried them crispy and tossed them into this pot with a chili sauce, jalapenos, bell pepper and bean sprouts. The flavors and textures were very nice, though I'll try boneless next time. Fried Fish Filet tossed in spicy sauce was actually no sauce at all. it was more like salt and pepper fried fish, but better. It's the familiar flavor, but had also dried chilis, cilantro and celery tossed in chili oi, and jalapenos on top. The batter on the fish was perfect. Was it spicy? It was a good managable spicy. It isn't like crazy Thai spicy, more flavorful chili flavor with a decent pinch of heat. I could use MORE spicy, but I like to teeter my spicy threshold. The portions were good, but things were eaten clean and I think is a testament to how good it was. These were enjoyable in the way that you can just not get tired of the bold flavor offered. The lady server was nice, but this is a place where you kinda have to wave to get some service sometimes. This was definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants we have, specially if you want to try something a bit different. The menu definitely had many curiosities that even one of the most foodie of foodies will discover a new food. I don't know why it took me so long to go back, but the next time will be soon.
5	Quickie review: This is possibly my favorite Chinese spot. Amazing food, very reasonable prices, decent but timing is imperative when going there. I may have checked in once, so far, on here but have been at least 15 times and will continue to come here.Real review:Timing: Why should timing come before anything else? Well, during peak lunch/dinner hours, this place often gets flooded with tour buses full of tourists. I think this is a testament to how much this place is loved but it damn sure has deterred me from eating there a few times because of the wait times that'll come with such an influx of diners.  Plan your day accordingly or wade through a sizeable wait....either way...it's worth the effort. Which brings us to....Food:As many commentators have notice, this is pretty un-Americanized Chinese food, if you're looking for simply a better version of Panda Express you should go to P.F. Chang's. So if  that's what you're expecting, get ready to either be disappointed or have your mind blown. The first thing you'll notice is that they have a huge selection of food across several categories: Soups/Noodle dishes, Seafood, Beef, Pork, Poultry, etc. The second thing you'll notice is that many of the dishes are spicy. They have plenty of delicious non-spicy dishes but if you're ok with the heat, you'll be able to enjoy more of their selection. Unfortunately, I tend to be a creature of habit, so I have not branched out and tried a lot of their dishes but what I have tried, I love, and I am sure their other dishes don't disappoint. We usually stick to Mo Pau Tofu,Crispy Spicy Chicken and Salt and Pepper Shrimp when we go and they never disappoint. Also, on cooler days, their soups are great and do not skimp on portion.Atmosphere:Not the biggest place but it is pretty comfortable even during tour bus time (see above). There are modest decorations and decorum that give it a nice ambiance.Service:  Overall, service is decent. Food is served relatively fast. However, getting your server's attention can sometimes be difficult, especially when it's busy. Some might think this is enough to knock the rating down to a 4 or 3...but not me. While it isn't the most friendly staff in the world (mostly due to the language barrier making conversation difficult) they are never rude and, when you finally do get their attention, they do respond fast. Overall, this remains my favorite Chinese restaurant.
1	I don't know what's happening here. This is one of those places that you read all the glowing reviews, you go try it yourself, and you think you must have gone to the wrong place. Upon sitting down, the waitress came over and waited at our table for us to decide on a dish, little weird but ok. I chose the Kung Pao Shrimp and my friend chose the Yunnan Style Dried Beef. What came out was shrimp in a pile of oil and my friends dish was even worse. It tasted like beef jerky from a 7-11, and it resembled Shit on a Shingle. $11.99 for each dish and PLUS they charge you for rice $3 extra. I didn't think my shrimp was spicy at all. My friend couldn't finish her plate is was so salty. Then the waitress comes back around with our bill and stands there until we pay. This situation was bizarre. Too many other places in Chinatown to ever give this place a second try.
5	At first, I had this at 4 stars, but I then I thought, "what would make this 5 stars?" And I couldn't think of anything. It was well rounded in all the ways necessary to make it a must-try.Firstly, it's nothing special on the inside or outside. It's a place with food. Secondly, the menu doesn't seem like anything special. You'll read through and think, "this sounds like a lot of places in Chinatown." You'll order and immediately you'll see why you'll be coming back.Immediately, you're going to get your order. It's faster than you expect by about... the entire time. It's almost back the minute you order it. I'm not sure if they're just magicians or psychics, but how is food out that fast? They had to have seen my order coming. Unfortunately, I don't remember the names of what we ordered but I can describe them.Our first dish was stir fried chicken with onions and other small cuts of veggies. A healthy serving. Tender chicken. Fresh, crispy veggies. Light sauce. Perfect. The second dish was beef tossed with another light sauce and vegetables, but this was spicy beyond what we were prepared for. The beef was tender and delicious. The whole dish was in a metal bowl with a fire underneath to keep it all hot. On the side, we had a very large dish of Chinese spinach.  It must have also made it through a wok, with some garlic. Crunchy and a fantastic contrast to the extremely hot and savory main dishes.All of this for a very, very reasonable price. I'd be back in a heartbeat. Oh, and ask them for recommendations. They know best.
4	It's an authentic Chinese restaurant! Chinese rice noodles used to be my favorite breakfast when I lived in China. However, I can't find that a restaurant sells it in the Bay Area. Vietnamese Pho is a totally different style rice noodle with Chinese rice noodles, and their flavors are nothing in common. In addition, this restaurant has a lot of spicy cuisines which is my beloved Szechuan flavor! Love it!
4	Yunnan Garden is an outstanding Szechuan destination. The Lamb with Cumin was really outstanding, though very spicy, so if you're not a fan of spicy food, stay away from anything marked with two chili peppers on the menu. They don't mess around. Overall this was a great dining experience, and very authentically Chinese.
5	Probably one of the best Yunnan/Szechuan restaurants in the US. Everything we ordered here was authentic and tasty, plus they have interesting selections like the DIY cold dish platter and tofu & fish fillet in clear broth, etc.
1	If there is 0 star here, I definitely will go with that. We went there on Christmas Eve, and there were several parties waiting outside. We got our number and notice by the owner we had to wait outside. We gotta stay chill and patiently wait for us to be called. After couple of minutes there was a party of 6 came in and without waiting, then we realized they skipped us. We were trying to tell the owner that we were in front of them, however the owner wasn't really friendly and almost yelled us he called us but we didn't appear. WTH! We were just outside. He opened the door rudely and yelled at us again 'go outside'. We decided leave for another place AND never stop by this horrible place anymore. Even though you are selected as top 100 Chinese restaurant in US, so what? Your customer services is the worst!
1	Bad experience. The place is crowded with group tourists from China. Waiting time is long. But the quality and quantity of the food are also surprisingly bad. Will not visit the place again.
5	Oh wow!  Where do I begin?  This place was recommended to me by a Chinese brother who lives in LA.  He wasn't wrong.  Szechuan doesn't always mean spicy, although some of what they serve will peel the paint off the walls.  Heat without flavor is just an exercise in pain control.Oh yes, there is heat aplenty, but there's also a deep flavor underlying the heat.  We started with the Yunnan noodle soup.  It was a clear broth, but very flavorful, and a good beginning to what came next.  At my Brother's recommendation, we ordered the boiled fish and beef in sauce (piquant), the Chongqing Spicy Chicken (it's a popcorn chicken style with deep fried chilis), and the green beans.  I was sweating by the time I was done, but what we took home was gone within 10 minutes of getting home by our son.Oh yes, the place is only about the size of a postage stamp, and we had to sit at a round table with two other groups.  We were also the only ones in the place using English menus, if that tells you something.I will not go to any other Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas again if I can help it.
1	Bad service. I would rate zero star if possible. They didn't serve us because we were waiting for friends coming. Extremely bad service. Don't go there if you are in a group
1	Don't come this restaurant.Supper bad service!!!! Food is also not good!!!! Will not be here again! !! The waiter let us out when we were sitting in the table and waiting for our friends. We have ordered food and eating. But they still let us out in order to place order customers to sit in. I have not been a restaurant like this bad bad service. Not recommend to come this place if you have a more than 5 people.
1	Super bad service!!!!! We got 7, when me and my friend come in, they ask us to sit down first. I told them rest of my friend will arrived in 20 minutes. They said it's totally fine and ask us to sit down and wait. However, after 5 minutes, when there was more customers came in, they ask us to leave our table and let other customers to sit down first (in a really bass manner)! I said I had informed you that my friend would arrived in 15 minutes. How come they ask customers to get up and leave the table once they assign for the table already! Main point is we have order some appetizer but not just sitting there and holding their table!!! So does it mean that they just want to kick us out!? If they want to earn lots of "money" they should just change their restaurant to fast food restaurant not providing service! SUPER SUPER SUPER BAD SERVICE! NOT COMING BACK AGAIN!
4	It was probably not a good idea to come on Christmas. Plus the tour buses were dropping off people in that plaza, too. We ended up sharing a table with strangers. That's Chinese restaurants for you. We didn't mind too much.. even kind of made some friends later, haha.I've had this dish called Chongqing Spicy Chicken at Jugoo but now they no longer exist so what to do, what to do?!?!Friend told me about this place because they have that exact dish BUT not the type of chicken I was expecting. It was deep fried or something and only decent at most. Disappointed with the chicken, but the dish is the same one, with all that influx of spices and such. A friend's mother says you're supposed to ask for the other type of chicken so I guess I could attempt that next time.We only got two dishes. The one mentioned above and the Lamb with Cumin. YUMS. I would totally get that again and again. Of course, I'll probably try other dishes but that one is a plus. I'm not much of a spicy person cause it just tortures me but it's still so damn good.
4	4.5 starsYES! My family is from Yunnan, and while I would say this is not necessarily authentic Yunnan cuisine (I would say that it's difficult to find authentic Yunnan food in China aside from the actual province itself), it is the best spicy food restaurant in Las Vegas (and most likely in the state of Nevada). If you're in Las Vegas and are looking for some authentic Chinese cuisine, definitely come here! The reason why I do not give it a full 5 stars is because of the service. Just remember that while it might seem like the servers are rude, they aren't. It's just the way it is. This restaurant gets crowded really easily so you should try to avoid the popular hours of lunch and dinner. Either arrive a little earlier or a lot later. They have a new system in place where you grab a number and wait outside.To the left of the entrance is a bar with some cold dishes. Definitely grab some for the table to snack on while you wait for your order to be taken and for the food to come out. All the dishes were flavorful (though some were a bit oily... so if you're watching your grease intake, be wary :P) - -Definitely try Yunnan Rice Noodle Soup (guo qiao mi xian) - a well known Yunnan dish (the dish here is lacking in the soup, but there aren't many places in the US that get this dish right) -Some other great dishes to try out - Boiled Fish with Sichuan Special Sauce; Szechuan style spicy lamb chop; Pork with chinese celery and green pepper; Stir-fried pork intestines with pickled pepper; Lamb with cumin
4	Looking for good spicy Szechuan food?  This is your place.  I have been meaning to try this place since I moved to Las Vegas a year and a half ago, but it wasn't until this past winter break did I actually get a chance to go.  My husband and I came at the end of the lunch rush on a Friday and were able to share a table with another party of four right away.  It didn't bother us, but it is just a heads up you are in a small group and it is busy.There was a large extensive menu and we probably didn't order the most popular dishes, but they were delicious!  Mapo Tofu - Chunks of soft tofu surrounded by perfectly flavor sauce.  It is vegetarian friendly (not that I'm vegetarian, but I thought I'd share) and was everything that I wanted it to be.  It was marked as spicy, but I felt that it was pretty mild.  I might have felt this because the other dish we ordered was really spicy.  After I sample a couple of their other dishes, I'm sure I will order this againChongqing Spicy Chicken - Soooooo Good!! At first it is a little scary because the perfectly fried chicken pieces are surrounded with chunks of chilies, but it was amazing!  The batter was light and very well-seasoned.  This is spicy, but not in the "OMG my mouth is on fire where is the water?" kind of way, it is has the occasional bite that numbs your taste buds, but it comes back in a couple of minutes.  I know that doesn't sound appealing, but if you avoid those chilies it is so worth it!I will without a doubt be back!  I can't wait to update my review when I get to try more dishes.
4	2014.  Welcome to the new year, and welcome to the new menu pricing.  A sad day when the prices go up significantly.  The food is wonderful, it used to be worth driving from a long ways away to eat here, but the prices all went up to ring in the holidays, and now it's time to find someplace else.  The pity is, they have you with the taste (authentic and awesome), so I know I'll end up back here again...Note that when it's super busy, they will not do take away orders!
3	Get to know the owners here if you're a spicy food lover- Szechuan Chinese is the way to go! Overall good quality, but on the oily side. This is to be expected for this type of food. Read on, I'm recommending the four to five star dishes.We came with a huge group and tested their kitchen with ravenous appetites. It's an impressive sight to see a group of Asians, not one over 5 foot six, demolish 30 some plates in less than a couple hours. Coney Island All American hot dog eating contest, here we come!For appetizers the pig ear disappeared in seconds and the tofu slices were second. For main dishes I highly recommend the Mapo tofu: the tofu was soft and silky and the dish got the flavors right. Also good is their stir fried kidney (sounds strange but walk on the wild side!), tasted fresh with a consistency between squid and bamboo shoot. Lastly their home brewed chicken soup finishes off a dinner that set your tastebuds on fire.
3	I've been meaning to try this place and last night, I finally got to go with one of my friends. My friend had already bee to this place about twice before so he knew his way around, which was very helpful! I was pleasantly surprised that when I walked it, it was already semi-busy -- it wasn't like SLAMMED but it held a good decent amount of people. Almost all of the tables were already taken. So my friend and I got seated, then some menus arrive, and then I start looking. Well, almost nothing looked familiar. Which was fine, but sometimes it's a little overwhelming but I do know that the one thing I want was LAMB. Anddd I left the decision to my friend HAHA :)He ended up ordering lamb with cumin, fish and pig intestines boiled in chili oil, and chong qing spicy chicken.Lamb with cumin: this dish came with a bunch of jalapeno peppers, red peppers, onions, and cilantro. It was delicious and by far, my favorite. I simply love lamb and cumin -- it is a wonderful taste. If you are unfamiliar with cumin, you may not get used to the flavor right away but trust me, this is the way to go. There is no better way of eating lamb than having it cooked with cumin. Definitely a dish you have to order when you're eating at Yunnan Garden. I also loved eating the jalapeno peppers from this dish too. Some were spicy and some were real spicy!Fish and pig intestines boiled in chili oil: they actually messed up our order and gave us fish with pork instead of pork intestine but they later on corrected it. Anyways this dish didn't seem spicy to me at all ... but that's probably because I was eating the jalapeno peppers from the lamb dish? In fact, it really didn't do anything for me. The fish was good to eat and pig intestines is always a favorite of mine but the flavors were kind of bland. I was expecting some spicy action going on and this dish did not deliver :(Chong qing spicy chicken: we originally ordered this and asked them to sub chicken wing for it cause according to my friend, it tastes better....but that didn't happen. Apparently they didn't have chicken wings. This dish, like the previous, did not deliver. I wasn't too interested in the flavors of this dish but one of the reasons could be that I was never really interested in popcorn chicken to begin with. And other than the numbing effect from the chicken, there wasn't much from it. The flavors just didn't wow me or captivate me, and wasn't really that spicy.Perhaps I'm just not into the Yunnan style of cuisine. One thing that I did NOT appreciate was that at the end of our dinner, they pretty much rushed us out even though there weren't any customers waiting for a table. When my friend went to use the restrooms, a server literally came over and asked if I wanted to box one of my dishes -- which was fine cause I was done. Then she boxed it, bagged it, and proceeded to take all the dishes, including the tea. Before she even finished, another server came with the check. O....kay? When I put my credit card down, it got swooped up quick and was charged in a minute. I filled out their portion of the receipt. Then I was filling out mine with the final price but before I got to set the pen down or put the receipt in my wallet, the server came over here and decided to explain to me that the receipt I was holding was mine. She said that I didn't need to sign it and it was my copy to keep. Thank you for that but you could have at least waited to see if I really was going to give you both copies first. It's like saying, "Oh thank you for giving me both gifts but you didn't have to!!" Well gee, they weren't both for you but thanks for assuming. I know which copy is yours and which is mine. I mean, I supposed it's nice of her, but I was already annoyed that she took away the TEA before I was done and that just kind of annoyed me a little bit more. I typically like to enjoy a cup of tea or two after a meal and before I leave the restaurant. I appreciate their fast service cause sometimes, it is hard at other restaurants to close the check. But damn, my friend didn't even come back from his restroom trip and you already took away everything AND charged my card. He couldn't even get a last cup of tea. I've never had that happen to me at a restaurant before. And I guess I know now ... you do not take my tea away from me! Would I come back? Probably. I'd come back just for the lamb with cumin dish. Maybe try something new as well. But I'll remember to have to hold onto my tea stuff at the end.A tip. Try to bring someone Chinese with you. These servers loved talking to us in mandarin and unfortunately, that was not our native tongue. We understood but we couldn't really reply. Their English wasn't that great either. There was a younger server whose English was decent -- she at least understood what we were saying to her in English.
4	I've actually been here quite a few times, twice in the past month or so. Probably been here maybe total 10 times or so, so far? But none of the times have i seen this place so packed. Last time i came here, granted it was xmas day, so it got to the point where my friend and i "dap toi" (cantonese saying) which pretty much means, multiple parties sitting at the same table, just for the sake of having a table to use, period. This time, i came with my friend, on a sunday night, and it was pretty packed, almost full, but not to point where people were waiting at the front for a table. The two times, had some overlapping dishes so will describe it when it comesLamb with cumin: This time, my friend is a huge fan of lamb and cumin (skewers) so i decided to order that. Both this time and last time, flavor was pretty spot on, if anything that i had to critique, was not enough lamb. Aside from that, the jalepenos was a hit n miss on if it was spicy or not, but flavor wise, with the cumin... Delicious ! Probably was the "spiciest" dish of them all. Chong Qing La Zi Ji (Spicy chicken w/ chilis): First time, i had ordered this, i was expecting it to come as cut chicken wings, but this time, it was like, popcorn chicken. Cuz i SWEAR, thats how it was before. Thinking it may have changed, we decided to eat it. After talking with my mom, who i have came here many times with before, she said you had to specially request it to be made with wings. Ok, so this time, I had specifically asked the waitress for chicken wing, she said ok. When the order came, it was the "popcorn chicken" style again. Asked another waitress why it was this, and not the chicken wing i had asked for, and she mentioned they dont do chicken wing, only this style. HMMM.... (more later) but back to flavor, it was like popcorn chicken fried with dried red peppers. I mean, its seasoned nicely, but hey! wheres the spiciness ?! "Water Boiled Fish" (Fished cooked in chili oil): Didnt get it last time, but ordered it this time because this friend loves spicy. Originally, i had asked for water and pork intestines, but the first time it came out, I dont know if the waitress who took our order didnt understand (more later) or what, but it came out fish and pork. like pork cut into little strips. Asked a different waitress, had it re-done with fish and pork intestine (why they use pork instead of pig, i dont know....) When it came out, its either their chef changed or style changed. i dont recall the sauce being so thick. Back then, when it came out, you could almost swear theres like a centimeter of red chili oil on top. Flavor was fine but as with the previous dish, not spicy. So usually after dinner, not only for chinese, but any other cuisine as well, you like to sit there and rest, drink some tea/soda/water/etc, and let the food settle a bit before leaving. For some odd reason, they seemed to be rushing. I mean, if it was busy, like it was on X'mas, its understandable, but it wasnt THAT busy. I had went to the restroom while my friend finished up eating. After i came back, i was told that the lady came to box up leftovers, cleaned EVERYTHING up including our tea and tea cups, brought her the check, took it and charged her, and brought it back, all within the period of me going to the restroom. WOW! I mean thats great they are so fast, but what the heck? We felt really rushed at the end. NO GOOD ! I swear they used to be more spicy, and better on their accuracy. I mean, even the mapo tofu was spicy enough to make me choke sometimes, let alone these few dishes we had ordered. I was sweating, but no where near how much i used to sweat, due to the spiciness. Ok now to emphasize on the "more later" parts. Since being seated, they love speaking to you in mandarin. Granted both times, we were able to understand, but this time, we understand, but arent fluent enough to reply. I'm not sure if its their style to be against those who can't speak mandarin or what. I'll probably give them one more chance, with my mom next time. If still off, welp.... you know what that means..
4	The spicy food will keep you young. Delicious and addictive.
4	We found this place on Yelp on our last visit to Las Vegas.  Schiff Drive is really more the parking lot/throughway in a series of Asian stores in the area.  When we went one evening we were the only non-Asian people in the restaurant.  Service was quick but not what you would call friendly.  At exactly 10pm (closing time), the waitress came over with the check and asked us to pay then so they could close out the registers.  The food, however, was fantastic.  The entrees come with huge portions and are definitely not the Americanized fare you find in most American-Chinese restaurants.  My partner got a dish of lamb ribs about the size of a finger.  I tried the kung pao chicken.  The chicken was delicious but extremely spicy.  Their steamed dumplings were great and very garlicky.
5	I love this place. The servers are typical Chinese which is fine with me because I'm Asian. I've been here a couple times and the food is spicy which is great. I can handle spicy because my parents grew up in Korea, but this food is spicy! My friend ordered the Stir Fried lamb which had bell peppers and some sort of spicy peppers. It looked like lamb with cumin. I ordered the fish with tofu and it game out in a soup based bowl. They were both pretty awesome, and I would definitely go again. The food is a bit pricier. Both our items were 12.99, but it is worth it!
4	Super fast service like you blink and there's hot amazing food right in front of you. My favorite is the lamb cumin, crispy, spicy, and sweet. If your looking for really good Chinese food this is place definitely will be back. The cold chicken feet and cucumber are also really good
1	Perhaps this is authentic Chinese food?  IF Chinese food tastes like lead mixed with funk, then this place is as real as it gets.I don't want to be harsh, because the service was quick and reliable, but the food really missed the mark..  I couldn't brush my teeth quickly enough.Don't do the dumplings, don't do the fried rice and don't do the crispy chicken and chiles.  Since that was my experience, that's really the only advice I have.  Oh, and bring some mints and Pepto.
5	Holy...shite.This place is what I have been searching for...for way too long!!!If you're looking for something that's not Americanized...this is it. This is the place.The ONLY downside is, the staff is a bit awkward if you're not Asian. I'm half Asian, but I don't look like it. The bf is very white. They weren't as friendly with us and not as tentative to us. And the waiter was very awkward, like he didn't know what he was doing. But you know what??? It's so freaking good, I don't give a shit! This is the place the Asian's go to. So - that's your sign.We had -Spicy beef dry potSpicy lamb potSpicy pork and wonton soup w/ rice noodlesKung pow shrimpEverything...EVERYTHING was amazing. Probably some of the best authentic Chinese food I've ever had.I definitely recommend the pots - if you're looking for something different and full of flavor.Also, this place is insanely cheap. We for 4 dishes for $50. That is insane. There was only two of us, but we love leftovers. Most places we go, we pay $60+ for 2 dishes with drinks.Very clean, very fast and amazing food. I can't wait to go back and bring my posse!!
5	This restaurant became very popular back in LA. Now they have a location in Las Vegas. Though the location isn't too good, people still flock here to eat their dishes . Known for their spicy food, I would recommend this place to anyone that enjoys spicy yunan food.
4	Still probably the best authentic spicy Chinese food in town. Their Kungpao chicken is just so amazing. I start to love the noodle now with some extra salt and vinegar. One star off for the sometimes ridiculously bad service, but if they can continue to cook that amazing kungpao chicken, i think i wipl endure the rude service.
3	My dad has complained many times why we don't go to Chinatown when we visit Vegas so this time I said fine, let's eat there.  I've never heard of "wun nam" cuisine but apparently it's part of Szechuan if I'm not mistaken.  Anyway we got their special noodles which they are famous for.  It's pretty good, has a similar taste to pho mainly because of the broth and the cilantro.  It was better than I expected but the smoked duck had too much smokiness flavor for me.I wouldn't mind coming back and grabbing some noodles but I won't be going out of my way to eat here.
5	The price of food is good , the service girls are very nice , she is helpful. We are enjoy the food from yunnan garden !
3	My Chinese friends love this place, but I think it is just OK. If you want to try real authentic Chinese dishes, I recommand this place, but if you prefer american-chinese cuisine (like panda express) you dont need to visit here. Try their garlic chicken. I think it is the best.
5	Great food. Spicy. Authentic. We like the eggplant dish, sour potatoes and some kind of boiled fish tofu Szechuan sauce soup stuff. It's so spicy it makes you sweat and cry at the same time.
5	Delicious and authentic.
2	Came here based on all the hype from Yelp reviewers and expecting this place to damn good. First off, I didn't mind that the servers weren't very friendly. At least they were attentive, right?! As for the food...let's just say that my mouth and lips were numb half way through my meal. Not from the spices, but from all the MSG. Yikes! Being Asians, not one of the eight entrees we ordered stood out to any one of our party of seven. Sad to say that we had tons of leftovers, but left it all behind. I've had my share of "authentic" Chinese food and this place does not compare. Sorry, but I'll have to pass the next time we are in Vegas.
1	It's a small place, max capacity is 68. You get hot tea right when you sit down. I got the wonton soup, tasted very bland, comes with 12 wontons for $6.99. My husband got the garlic ribs. It's breaded and deep fried. Had absolutely no flavor for $12.99. It was hard to down the food even though we were starving. We were still hungry after, so we went to Lee's Sandwich. I have no idea how it got 4 stars.
1	Horrible restaurant. We were seated by very unfriendly waitresses, ordered, the food didn't taste well. Fried rice was horrible, I got the hot and sour noodle, it was pretty ok but a bowl of noodle 2:1 soups. So I asked for more soup, and yes, they are giving you chicken soups and it cost $3 :) sweet huh? A rice bowl size of soup cost $3. Well, I saw a group sat, ordered and left after the first dish arrived, so I DONT THINK I WILL EVER COME AGAIN.
4	The service was a bit abrupt/clipped, but the fried rice was amazing!  Great location, small/intimate but very fast service!  Soda comes in a can rather than from a fountain.  Overall was very impressed with a restaurant we decided to visit on the fly.
5	I come to Vegas regularly for Conventions or just to have fun playing poker.  I usually rent a car and spend considerable time finding places off the strip to eat at.  I'm with  my family and my brother so we walk into this place and it is packed and we are the only non-asian people in the place (I took that as a good sign).  Anyhow when I asked for crispy noodles the waitress looked at me like I was from Mars.  The Chinese lady in the table next to me came to my rescue when she overheard me and knew what I was talking about and began explaining to the waitress what I wanted in Chinese.  She quickly smiled and looked at me and said they don't serve crispy noodles here, at least not the type you are thinking of.  I'm thinking boy I must look like your typical American moron, so I quietly began looking at the menu for dishes that looked familiar.  I settled for a scallions and onions, a kungpao plate, some of the speciality fried rice, a noodle bowl with some of the more exotic meats like stomach, and a couple of other dishes that were recommended by our neighbor friend.   I must say I have never eaten such good food.  All of the dishes were amazing. It was one of the most enjoyable and best tasting meals I have had in a long time.  I wasn't the only one in our group that felt that way.  We all raved about how good it was.  I don't think we left a crumb of food on any of the plates.  I can't say enough about how good this place is and how much better authentic Chinese food tastes in comparison to the American version we are used to being served in even fine places on the strip.  Just the night prior I had eaten a crispy noodle dish at the Aria casino which I thought was pretty decent but this place puts it to shame.  I will come back to eat at this place every single time I am Las Vegas.
4	Was great food and no wait. I always like to come here when I visit. Food is very spicy but delicious.
2	Yunnan Garden - Chinese family style restaurant - average ~$15 including tip. What should I say? Terrible service and over salty foods filled with a lot of MSG the miracle spice. After you done with ur meal u can feel how salty ur mouth actually is and ur tongue is just rash because of the salt in the foods. 2.5/5 because foods are worse than my sister's cooking... never come back!
5	Amazing food! My bf and I were craving some authentic Chinese food for dinner. After looking at some of the pics on yelp we decided to try out their mapo tofu and fried fish with spicy sauce. Yes they were both spicy but not just spicy the flavor was there. My bf was in Hunan china a few years ago and said that their food is authentic. I've never been to china to compare the real Chinese food but all I can say is their food is a must try!!!!
5	I don't want to write this review because I am selfish and don't want to wait in a long line. Damn, why am I doing this. Arghhhhhh.Ok, it fantastic but...Its the best Chinese food in Las Vegas for Yunnan style food. If you are from North Dakota and eat Egg rolls and General Chows chicken, you will not like this place. Go to Panda Express. Do not expect beef and broccoli.If you have an understanding of very fresh Home made Southern Chinese food and like spicy well made dishes, this is your place. (They do have some non-spicy dishes)Do expect super fresh, very well made food. (Not much sea food here).The have cold appetizers that are great. After you get a table, go up to the cash register. You will see all of them laid out. You can get 3 on a plate. I like the dried beef, cucumber and cabbage.They have a fish dish that is simple and does not smell like fish. No bones. Not one. Its so tender. Its the fish filet in brown sauce with garlic. Its not spicy. I think its #58Their soups are very good.I love their beef in spicy szechuan sauce and the wonton in chile sauce. Kung Pao chicken is great!You can feed 8 people for under $100. The decor is sparse. But the food divine. Do not go here on Christmas (oy vey). This is real Chinese food. Tour buses full of people from China go here. The wait staff is very attentive. You can take a cab from the strip. Its not far. Just off Spring Mtn Rd. It is hard to find as its hidden in a strange strip mall. Good for me, I know where it is.This is not your typical Chinese food style. Many dishes are spicy but there are some that are not. Give it a try. You will love it.UPDATE: 4/30/14Looks like they raised the prices a little bit.Just as good as ever.
1	Food here is good. Service is bad and the people are rude and also very dumb. Hi-hoh!
5	People are nice. Food are the best. A lil bit more expensive than regular chinese place.
4	So far I tried #18 and #25, both are noodles. Also tried the pork ribs with fried garlic, I really liked the #18 noodle, I finished the whole thing last time. My friend said it is authentic Yunan style. #25 is too oilly but taste alright. I don't like the fried ribs with garlic, too hard.
3	I'm a little put off by an authentic Chinese restaurant listing "Yunnan Fried Rice Noodle" on the menu and then serving me spaghetti and soy sauce. Seriously?
1	6/18/2014 - Went with my girlfriend to eat lunch. They seated us immediately, but did not ask us for any drinks until I flagged a waitress down after 10 minutes of waiting with no service. After we requested drinks and food I had to stand up and ask again foot our drinks at the front counter. Food came quickly, but waitress never came back to us nor spoke to us again. Had to stand up again to ask for bill.
1	Very TERRIBLE Restaurant. Very bad service and food. The young women did not shows friendly. And they did not turns the AC on during the summer afternoon!!!!!!!!!!!!!Never come here again.
1	Horrible! The noodle come with one pc pork and chicken. No vegetable!  You also can not use chopstick for rice noodle because is too short and soft. Is very bad spicy Chinese food. And also come with poor service. No AC on in summer! Yunnan Garden in LA is better.
4	Nine of us ate here on a Monday night. Without having called ahead we were lucky to get the last available table and were the only non-Chinese customers. We ordered a broad range of dishes, some for the two vegetarians, some for the two who didn't like spicy food, and some for the rest of us. My pork with preserved vegetables was delicious and authentic, with real Szechuan pepper. The wait staff don't have much English and our waitress tried to talk me out of that dish as especially spicy but I was glad I went with it. I've missed food like that. No apparent air conditioning but we weren't uncomfortable although it was very hot outside. Everyone seemed happy with their meal.
4	Awesome and truly authentic. No General Tso's here.
1	If u want to have polite service, pls dont think about this restaurant. Waitresses are  so mean and they took wrong order for us.then we requested to change.we can barely heard waitresses talking bad things about us.we were so mad.i can swear, that was my first time I didnt leave a penny on table when check.suck waitresses service.all the dishes we ordered were so much oil.i wont recommend anybody go visit this restaurant.
5	Sichuan all the way!I ordered chongqing Spicy Chicken; my first time trying genuine Sichuan peppercorns, amazingly tingly and hot!  The Ma Po Tofu was also equally amazing; tofu was excellent quality and flavors were very pleasing.  The Spicy chicken had me drenched in sweat but was well worth it.  After a minute the hot sensation leaves and is replaced with a tingly sensation on the tongue, followed by a strange sensation to continue to eat the hot food...I loved it!  I'm definately coming back.
5	If you've got a craving for Szechuan food, please do yourself a favor and come here. It's authentic, it's hot, and it's delicious. The Kung Pao Chicken was very good. I really love really spicy food and this KPC was great for me. However, if you can't really tolerate spicy food, you may want to mention this before you put in your order. This place is perfect if you have a friend who is a FOB from China who likes spicy food !
5	Excellent food. Favorite dishes:  Dan Dan Mien, Chongqing chicken, Salt and Pepper shrimp.  Service is just ok and waitresses have limited English skills.   Very authentic Chinese dishes.
3	I was the only Caucasian in the restaurant. Waitresses are curt, probably due to the language barrier. Couldn't get the dumplings fried, only steamed. Signs are not in English. Eggplant was tasty. However, I didn't feel like lingering, so I asked for it to be packed up, so I could enjoy it later in a less frenetic setting.
1	I wish yelp would have a 0, because they don't even deserve a 1!!!! There should b a negative!! Where's the flavors???!!!! Seriously! !  We ordered 5 dishes and nothing taste good. Every dishes was either too oily or to sweet and has way to much sauce!! Sorry but this will b my first and last time eating here. I ordered the rice noodles with spicy ground pork and it looked good but after the first taste.....Disappointed!!!! There were no sriracha!!!! Seriously? !!!! How come you do not have sriracha??! You have to have sriracha at any Chinese restaurant! !! The soup base was OK but when you mix the spicy ground meat with the noodle.....it was wayyyy to oily!!! It was not even spicy.Service was bad, food was bad, everything was crap. They didn't even give us water!!!!!I'm sorry but the food wasn't even worth taking pictures or ig lol
1	Never go there the service so bad I will never go kind of like these place so socksh. So Ri long
5	Dad and I went here for an early dinner; it was memorable.Food:  I ordered the chongqing shrimp and ma po tofu; dad ordered fish and garlic in brown sauce.  My shrimp dish didn't come with extra peppercorns like I asked but tasted very good still, the ma po was spot on, and Dad's fish in brown sauce was the best of the evening.  His fish was very tender, huge pieces of garlic and ginger provided for surprising taste explosions and the brown sauce was delicious.  My shrimp was spicy and tasted delicious; however, there's simply too high of a chili-to-meat ratio for my liking this time; plus no extra peppercorns for the tingle sensation on the tongue.  The ma po was silky smooth with a delicious, rich-red chili base, fresh scallions, and tofu that when you break them open they reveal pure white.Service:  Our waitress that took the order was clearly irritated.  She started off by mean mugging  a customer (who had just walked in the door); saying, "I want to eat my dinner".  Now I totally understand being hungry and needing to eat but, YOU WORK IN A RESTAURANT; you can eat anytime; at least try not to look so mean infront of us.  I repeated my order three times, the third was the charm, after I told her I didn't order three of the same dishes but one dish that was totally different.  I asked for extra peppercorns upon examining my spicy shrimp and found that there were hardly any, so I asked a nearby staff member who when asked if I could have extra peppercorns she replied by shaking her head "no" and looking at me like I was a dumbass.  After Our first serving of water that was the last time we saw any service for at least three quarters the entire meal.  The entire staff were seated at the large main table in front of the door, all texting, all the time making brief eye contact with us and ignoring our H2O needs.  Finally, I just stuck my hand up high while holding my empty water glass when the young man was looking my way and shook it; he understood and thankfully left the pitcher on our table.  After we had our fill I had to do a similar gesture to get someone's attention for the bill.  One thing is for sure; the service sucks but the food is great!Atmosphere:  Clean and tasty water, complimentary hot green tea with meal.  Table seating with a small deli-like section towards the front of the restaurant.  Seating space is somewhat limited and just a warning:  Avoid sitting at the first table to the left of the door, you'll be blasted repetitively by either hot air from outside in the summer and cold air in the winter...not fun.  Very plain interior, could use some authenticity, unless this is authentic yunnan-style restaurant interior?Price:  Not too bad for the quality and taste. i wish they provided more information on their menu regarding the ingredients in the dishes.  For example; what kind of fish did we have tonight; we have no clue and the waitress couldn't understand our question to provide an answer, and what deliciousness is in their Ma Po Tofu.  I'm not suggesting they reveal every single ingredient, but the main ingredients would be nice.Overall:I would definitely come back.  I think I'll stick to their seafood and the Ma Po Tofu for sure!  I'm really curious how their lamb tastes...looks delicious.  Authentic Sichuan flavor to be sure.
4	One of the better meals we had off The Strip. We ate Cumin Lamb, Dry Chili Chicken and beef chow mein. All was devoured without regret or consideration for safety of others. Service was typical, disaffected and largely disinterested. Whatever...I'm here for the food, and it was good. We'll be back.
2	Too expensive for the portions you get and you have to order rice because it doesn't come with your dish. Mini lamb hot pot translates to hardly any meat on the bombs. The spicy tastes good but there is more peppers than chicken.Overall the taste was good but $14.99 for each dish without rice is crazy!
1	This place is Terrible. I can't believe I wasted a Vegas meal on this place. Where do you go for the best Chinese food? Chinatown right? WRONG. So we walk into this place and are greeted with obvious shock and surprise, like what are you doing here? It was bizarre to say the least. We sit down and look at the menu, lots of choices most of which are spicy. We sat there for quite some time before a waitress came to take our order, she couldn't speak English very well so we pointed to the item which was also written in Chinese. The food comes out one dish at a time. We ordered house fried rice. Which turned out to be shaved cured pork belly, not bacon mind you..think salty pork, green onion and rice with an overwhelming flavor of fish sauce. It was also quite oily. Our second dish of pork spare ribs in sweet and sour sauce comes. The flavor is good but there is very little meat and mostly bone in bite sized pieces. It's not cool to be fishing in your mouth for bones especially when you feel like your being observed by patrons and staff alike. The third dish of smoked duck comes, clearly it is liquid smoke, not true smoked meat. Nothing good about this meal. I am not a rude person so we asked our server to box the leftovers so as not to insult them. I told her she could just put it in one box. I believe this offended her as she was adamant that they be put in separate boxes...ok, we walked out of there and immediately threw it in the trash which was our intent from the beginning. Hence the one box. Don't go here...fair warning. Hard lesson learned. I will be eating on the strip for my Chinese food fix from now on. I almost forgot a very angry lady came inside to complain about their delivery driver, apparently he cut her off or something in the parking lot. She asked to talk to him but the waitresses never went and got him. They were rude to her and she left very upset.
5	Great new (for me) find for Chinese (Yunnan) food.  The garlic spareribs are phenomenally crispy and the cri & spicy beef dry pot are awesome!
5	My favorite Chinese food in Vegas. Great spicy foods, love the spicy beef noodle soup. Used to be sleepy, but now there's a line out the door.
3	Eat here every couple of weeks, food is good, not great , but good.  It is consistent and the portions are adequate
5	Doesn't get more authentic.  Best Chinese by fast.  Beef pot dish is so tasty.  Seasonal vegetable is so worth it and the chicken with scallion and onion is to die for.
5	Most authentic Chinese food from China (not American Chinese) I have ever had. I travel to China 2-3 times a year and it is EXACTLY the same. Have the spicy beef hot pot and spicy tofu, both were excellent! This is a real experience for anyone that has never traveled to China before
4	My go-to Chinese place almost every time I visit Vegas! I love their chicken feet with pickled peppers!!! (it could be more spicy though)
2	Ordered to go. When i went to pick up my order oh my, Prices went up. $8.99 for chicken fried rice. The taste also changed. Less tasty like it used to be. I ordered Mongolian beef and was given Onion beef for $14.99! Didn't want to argue the price since I've always liked the restaurant. Everytime were in Vegas we get good here but what a disappointment. I was gonna give them a chance if the food tasted the same but it didnt. I think the prices for the food we got were outrageous. I don't think we'll order from here again.
5	This place gets better and better. And busier, I might add. This is Szechwan Chinese food at it's finest. Short recap - this is a get in and get out kind of place. It was INSANELY busy last night and they were trying to just get people seated, served and get them out. Again, don't expect excellent customer service here, just expect the best Chinese food you may ever have here in the states. It's the best. We brought my boyfriend's parents here last night and they haven't had much authentic Chinese food, and they were very impressed. The best thing we had last night was the Rice Noodles w/ Sweet and Sour soup and spicy pork stew. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing the taste is with this soup. It's a perfect blend of spices, herbs, the cilantro that gives it that nice topping and just the pork itself...mouth watering. We also shared:Cured pork with green beans, which was okay. It was more like cripsy dried out bacon. It was the only thing I've ever ordered that I wasn't a fan of. Cumin Lamb, always a favorite. Not too spicy, but the cumin in it is very strong. So be prepared. Garlic Shrimp, good, but not my favorite. A good dish if you can't have soy. Chongqing Spicy Shrimp, awesome. This is one of the most recommended dishes and I see why. It is friend with tempura, but it's so bold, spicy and full of flavor.Overall, I absolute LOVE this place. It's so good and the prices are still very reasonable for the amazing quality this place has. They raised the prices by $5-7 per dish. But again, it's so worth it. Be prepared to wait, but also be prepared to be amazed. This is Chinese like you've never had it. You'll never wanted Americanized again.
1	The service is ridiculously  bad. I will never come to this place ever again. The food is alright
4	Authentic spicy Chinese food! Quick service and absolutely delicious!We came on Christmas Eve since we were with our Chinese relatives from china and they much prefer Chinese food over American cuisine. Found this place with a quick search on yelp. There is ample parking and this is located adjacent to the Chinatown plaza. We had a party of 9 and was still seated right away. Let me just take a moment and add a fat shiny star for their extra speedy service. Have you been to jimmy johns before? This is seriously almost as quick as that but way more quality food. I swear this place gave me my dinner faster than any fast food places. I wouldn't say the service was good but the speed makes up for it. As for the food, it is so good! Even my Chinese relatives said it taste like the food in china! Definitely not americanized. I loved the chicken feet and even bought some extra for later. I also really enjoyed the pickled sprouts, cucumber, mapo tofu, and spicy fish. My spicy chicken mi fen noodle was good and warm! Not too spicy and tasted so good with the other appetizers we ordered. I was very stuffed and we still took a lot of leftovers:) it was definitely one of those homey, satisfying meals! If you are in Vegas and craving a good, delicious and simple Chinese meal, this is the place to try! I enjoyed it more than those fancy American expensive dinners:)
1	The waitress is very rude. The bowls and dishes are with stains and very strong cheap detergent smell. The food is OK. But the dirty environment is definitely a no go for me. I will not recommend this place to any of my friends.
1	Super bad service! Came in around 6:30pm. A lot of tourist bus were waiting in the front, restaurant was pretty full. So the server asked us to order after we sit for only 2 mins. Then after 10 mins eating, started to rush us to finish. Right after when we pay, while I was putting my card into the wallet, they start to ask us to sign the receipt.... What a bad experience. Food taste normal, not special at all. Will not come again!
4	I give this restaurant 4 stars because they have genuine Chinese food, not american-chinese food. They have very good cold appetizers and it is only $6/dish. The only thing is the marinated pork is way too salty! Do not order any dish cooked by marinated pork or bacon I can say, I think they just use bacon instead.
4	A hidden gem, they have a little appetizer bar full of spicy items e.g tripe, pig ears, tofu, etc it's delicious too! I'll be coming back for more
