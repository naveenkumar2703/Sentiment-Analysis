5	This place offers fantastic service and pricing. The owner is attentive and hard working and they have the highest quality oil around!
5	Been coming here for over twenty years! 25 bucks for an oil change that takes fifteen minutes and never a line! As a woman it's important to me to have a mechanic I can trust. No worries at Action Fast! These guys you can trust! Thanks Action Fast for all your hard work and devotion! See ya in 3,000 miles! :)
5	Make sure you tell Jay that you saw the Action Fast Lube ratings on Yelp. Didn't see a $25 dollar oil change option,  I got the 5,000 miles oil , new filter, fluids check and tire pressure set to my requested setting for $47.00. Was in & out in under 25 minutes. Can't beat that. See you guys in Oct.
5	Quick, friendly service at a fair price. They changed the oil and checked the tire pressure for me in 15 min. I paid 27.54 including tax. I was not bombarded with a sales pitch for over $1000, but was told, in an honest and polite manner, that I could get a broken door handle fixed for $75 (other places have quoted that same fix for over $100). Finally, found the place I'll be getting my oil changed on a regular basis! Tip: Action Fast Lube is located next to Sun Devil Auto, they are separate businesses. Action Fast entrance is behind the store.
5	Really pleased with the quality and speed of service at this place.  Definitely will be my go-to place for oil changes.
5	Fastest oil change ever? I think so! Dig the gun mags on the coffee table too, they were really old but I didn't have time to read anything anyway!
