5	Enter Spring Training Festival 2013...Okay, so I am not a fan of baseball. However, I don't dislike the sport just neutral. So, when I'm in Old Town Scottsdale, and through walking around I find out there is a festival. I think, why not?!?! I'm up for all types of experiences! Entrance $5 kids under 12 Free! There are beer vendors and food vendors, and vendors to sign you up for cable. You know how how it goes. But, I had no idea they would have Rollie Fingers Hall of Fame 1992 3X World Series Champion 1981 AL CY Young/MVP. And, for only $20 you can have a basebal signed and take as many pictures with a smart phone as you want. And, right next to him...care to guess? Gaylord Perry Hall of Fame 1991 314 Wins 3,534 K's 1972 AL CY Young/1978 NL CY Young.That in itself was worth $5 bucks!!!Oh, they also had a live band in the middle of the park. Some songs were better than others. Overall not bad.Should I be in Scottsdale again around this time. I'll make sure to experience the Spring Training Festival again!

Some retired baseball start were there, like Rollie Fingers, which was very cool. All-in-all a good little warm-up to Spring Training.
