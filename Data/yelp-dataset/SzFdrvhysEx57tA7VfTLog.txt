5	This place is the TRUTH!  I've been shopping @ Frederick's for years.  I visited the store in Arizona Mills a few months back, but it's a bit out of the way for me.  I just learned of this new outlet store yesterday (Black Friday).  This is their ONLY outlet store in the country, so consider yourselves lucky PHX-metro ladies!  They were offering lots of specials for Black Friday, but even their regular prices are clearance.  They have a "damaged" section that has items deeply discounted; some of which aren't even damaged!  Also, they have lots of bras for the over C- cup crowd and "uncommon" size girls (32-band) like myself.  I got a satin robe for $5 dollars, bras for $8 and some panties.  Nicky was a very helpful sales associate.  She helped me with the corsets of which I purchased 2!  I will definitely be back!
1	oh no!! I heard the outlet is closed. Does anyone know why?!
5	The outlet closed just before Christmas. I work in the same building complex and was here 4-6 times a month.The ladies were fabulous, Nikki, Mary Ellen and the whole gang were so helpful. I'm sad that the building was sold. I have hundreds of items from Freddi's and loved each.
5	This was a great little outlet store. Tried to get a few things just before valentines day this year and found that it was under construction. Does anyone know if it will reopen, move, etc?
