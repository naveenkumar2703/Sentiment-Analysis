4	I judge my ratings on places like these by the frustration factor, cleanliness, and competence of the employees.This is close to home.  It's a smaller location, but they have consistently long-term employees here who know what they are doing, and do it fast.The store is clean and you get in and out fast.  Gas pumps are shaded well.
2	I like Phyllis K's line of rating a place by among other things: a " frustration factor".  So I'm going to steal it.  LOLIf the Circle K up on Greenway was Three and Half Stars.  Then based on the above mentioned "frustration factor", this Circle K is only Two and Half Stars.  Don't get me wrong the prices are good and the employees seem very friendly and nice.  But, my frustration on getting into the station and getting out, without an accident accounts for the rating.  I avoid the place.  Most drivers, going north on Tatum don't expect you stop and pull-in after the intersection.  The light turns green, you turn on your signal and the person behind you is accelerating onto your tail.  The same is true for exiting.  Folks just blow through the light and seem to miss the fact that someone else might be exiting or assume its a one-way when pulling in.   As Elmer Fudd would say: "Be berry berry careful out there... and watch out for Wascally Wabbits!"
3	A larger one of their locations with the standard offerings.  Quick and easy to get gas and a snack (if you want one).  The gas is comparable to the area as far as price.  Plenty of pumps, so it's rare to come here and not be able to just get in and out quickly without a wait.Overall: B+Larger location with comparable gas prices for area. Getting in and out on the main street may be a bit difficult during higher traffic times.
