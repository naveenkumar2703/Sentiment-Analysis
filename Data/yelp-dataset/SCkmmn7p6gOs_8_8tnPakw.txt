3	I was in the area when this little cafe caught my eye.It was early so they  were only serving breakfast.Great menu selections at very affordable prices. Super friendly waitress, Fresh made salsa bar.....YUM!I got the Huevos Rancheros I think it was $5.50 (see pics)It was totally Delicious!! Loves that sauce with chunks of jalapenos, it had such a good flavor without being too spicy.Guest had a breakfast Burrito Enchilada style with eggs, bacon, potato and cheese...$3.50 (see pics)This location is only open for breakfast and lunch, but they also do alot of catering if your in need. I was told they bought another restaurant around the corner that will be open for dinner...coming soon.I'll be back next time I'm in the area.
4	Great place for breakfast. Not your typical bacon and eggs. They the borderline special. Dammm good.
2	They've moved to a new location on 2nd street.  We met a out-of-state friend here, half way between PHX & TUS. I figured to give her a good taste of the southwest. Since I don't live in Casa Grande, I thought I'd check user reviews from multiple internet sites.  Wrong!The food was just so so.  The wait staff don't have a clue on how the food is prepared.  Apparently the food is prepared differently by different cooks (chefs?).  It's a crap shoot. I expect guacamole to be made with avocados, not green sour cream with undefinable lumps in it. As for the award winning green chili pork, I can't for the life of me understand what competition they won. It's a nice place to eat if you like so-so food and a unknowledgable wait staff.
2	"I don't know I just work here" should sum up the service given at border line. This was the answer I got to a question from the one and only employee we could find in the restaurant. She was impatient with taking our order.
