5	I just started going to this barber about 3 months ago. And I got say if you are looking for a haircut around 32st and bell rd PV BARBERS is the place to go. PV barbers not only give good prices but give great and professional haircuts. PV barbers gives you a business card that gives you your 7th haircut free. All the barbers are very nice and respectful. It is also great that all barbers speak both English and Spanish. In my opinion Pv barbers is a 5 star barbershop !!

5	I have been a customer of Rubens for about ten years. He has always done a great job on my hair. It was awesome watching him grow to having a full barber shop. The other barbers who work at pv barbers are great too. Pv barbers are very hospitable, every time I walk in I'm greeted and feel comfortable.  Overall the business is very well run and gives me the feel of a old time barber.  Ps the strait shave is where it is at!
5	Ruben is the man for the job....I meet Ruben 5 years ago when he was working across the street and then followed him everywhere he went. Finally he has his own barbershop. I wouldn't trust my hair to anyone else. If you want a great and affordable haircut this is the place
