5	I am a Walgreens junkie. I love this place. I will find any excuse to go inside.
4	The friendly staff helped me get in get what I needed and get out.  I come here every so often and I'm just impressed by how quick my trips are.
4	This is my corner Walgreens. I've been getting my prescriptions and last minute knickknacks from here since 2004.The pharmacy is wonderful! We used to have this one pharmacist for years who got to know us pretty well (...by drug store standards. I mean, she knew who we were by the number of ear infections, pink eyes, and colds my kids would get year-round). It was a cool relationship.Anyway, something happened to her but I don't know what it is was. Sad, she's not there anymore (Hold on I need a moment...ok I'm fine now.). The new pharmacists rotate quite a bit so my visits aren't personal anymore.The photo guy with the dreads is way cool! LOVE him! In fact, all the staff there have been friendly every visit. The store is always clean and typically have everything I need in stock. I especially like the discounts I get buying the Walgreen brand.Now, they have a rewards card! Cool! We get points for filling prescriptions too! Nice... I just started the program so don't  know the benefits and value just yet. I'll post tips about that in the future.Bottom line: clean, friendly, affordable, and convenient.
5	Every person that works here says hello. Whether they are stocking the Pringles or behind the register, they seem to be genuinely glad I am at their Walgreens. There are two main pharmacists that seem very quick and efficient and are always there. They double check dosage and drug allergies for my two young children, which I appreciate so much. I feel at home when I come in or drive thru the pharmacy. Love the "be well" slogan that they sing out to me as I depart their store, too! Customer service award deserved for this store!
