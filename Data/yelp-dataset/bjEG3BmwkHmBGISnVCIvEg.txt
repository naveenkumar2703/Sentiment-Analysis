5	I found Kimberly on Yelp. I have had many pedicures from "small shopping mall spa's" and assumed that was what you get. I was wrong, you definitely get what you pay for!!! I took advantage of Kimberly's Yelp deal and scheduled directly through her. She is amazing! I am a runner and don't necessarily get pedicures for the cute polish as much as I do the foot massage. Other than a ten minute massage by someone wearing rubber gloves... Kimberly is a certified reflexologist who spent about 30 minutes just on the massage! My plantar fasciitis felt better and in turn so did my knees and hips. She is such a lovely person just to sit and talk with and is so passionate about what she does! I am so thankful to have found her!!!! Give her a call!
5	As a med student, I am constantly under stress and my feet have been paying the price for it. Being a new resident of Nevada, I searched for a place I could get a legit foot massage and a pretty pedicure. I found Kim (thank goodness), after a lot of "hit and misses" elsewhere. She's so good at what she does! I feel like a new person after an hour with her! I will definitely be back!
