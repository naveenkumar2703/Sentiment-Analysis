1	This is one of a very few places in Phoneix with awesome shrimp ceviche. Aside from the ceviche the rest of the food I've tried at Mariscos Mi Lindo Mazatlan has been quite disappointing. For instance, shrimp cocktail was served with shrimp that hadn't been cleaned (vein still in). The waitresses are snobby and the dinning area smells like burnt cooking oil. The plastic table covers are dirty and beer prices are that of a 5 star hotel.
1	Horrible service, mediocre food. When you have to flag down the waitresses to get a drink 10 minutes after you are seated, then flag another one down to get chips. Then you are not done eating and they clean around you and bring the bill right after. Then they sit right there and wait for you to sign your bill, you gotta be kidding me!! Never again!!
4	The shrimp ceviche is my favorite. Have had other dishes that were also very good but I really like their ceviche tostada.
2	Terrible food + terrible service. I won't say much about my experience but its enough to never return.
2	I have been here a couple of times and the food is just ok I think is over priced , Is too pricey for the type of food , the service SUCKS . They didn't greet me when I was at the door waited there for a wile before someone noticed me ,  the lady that was taking care of my table she went to lunch and she didn't even send someone to help us ,
5	Best Mexican seafood ever!!!! It's better to order for pick up since it gets really loud
