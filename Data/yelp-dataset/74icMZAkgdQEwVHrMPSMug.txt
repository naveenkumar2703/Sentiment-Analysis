5	In a town where people proclaim themselves as trustworthy, honest & "The Best", it is incredible to find an air conditioning company that does not simply make statements but earns a reputation by doing a great job at a fair price. My air conditioner stopped working. I called George at Highland Cooling & he arrived quickly to help us get relief from the 110 degree weather that was invading our home. He & his assistant worked for many hours rebuilding my existing AC unit. My air conditioner is 34 years old. Any other company would have simply tried to sell me a new unit. Knowing I was on a tight budget, George rebuilt that which had to be a challenging job. I have refered Highland Cooling to many people & everyone has been very happy with his service. If you are in need of an excellent Air Conditioning Company, I highly recommend George at Highland Cooling.
5	George came to my aid today. Working with-in the guidelines of a home warrenty isn't always easy. George was very knowledgable about my unit and didn't try to gouge me on services. I had another company come out first ( what a mistake) who quoted me a price 3300.00 more than what George was able to fix my unit for. George and Highland Cooling have got a customer for life. They arrived promptly and didn't keep me waiting. I feel I got an honest opinion and price with my unit. And when it is time to replace my unit, Highland Cooling will be doing the service. His price quote for a new unit was far below what the competitor quoted me. Thanks George
5	We called George and his Highland Cooling team when the cooling went our on the 1st floor or our home.  He discussed the options with us and we agreed on a whole house replacement at a great price.  We were very happy with his estimate, the work he did and now our electric bills are lower.  He even assisted our neighbor when his wife became ill.  I can't say enough good things about the experience with Highland Cooling.
