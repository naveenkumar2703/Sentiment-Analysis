5	This store deserves more business!!!!  Nice employees, doesn't stink like urine, great environment.
5	I am not entirely sure what to say about this place except that it is my go-to store for pet supplies.I have been in here multiple times to look for anything from cat litter, to cat food, to beds. (plus a long time ago, fish supplies).Every time I have came I have been greeted by someone on the floor. In every case, the person seemed to know what they were talking about and made sure that I not only found the product... but made sure that I knew that if it didn't work to bring it back. Let me say this once - customer service means a lot to me and this store has been very good to me.So if you love your little furball at home, I suggest you come and get them some goodies here at Petco.
4	My favorite part about coming here to get supplies for our animals, is looking at the kitties up for adoption. My least favorite part is knowing I can't take all of them home! :( Prices are a bit high on certain things, but it's a good store. Friendly employees and a clean store makes for a good shopping experience.
5	Just moved to AZ and this is my local Petco. Everyone's really helpful and friendly. We just took our dogs here to get groomed and they came back smelling fresh and looking clean.
