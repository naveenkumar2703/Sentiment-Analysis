5	Pies -- what else -- by-the-slice or the whole pie. Sweet pies include classics such as fresh seasonal berries, cream pies, and apple; as well as more unique offerings such as Italian Ricotta wth raisins, chocolate, citrus & nuts, or Pear and Pecan Streusel.  They also make wonderful meat pies and quiche, and gift baskets with pies, homemade cookies, and exotic coffees.
3	This is a nothing but pies place...so I was expecting a little bit more oomph...Dispointing small selection of pie by the slices...also you gotta put in special order ahead of time for the more interesting stuff like Italian Ricotta.  I was going to order something with berries, but the stuff I saw in the case was just runny and wet looking...so I ended up with a black-bottom pie...I really liked the flaky crust and the filling wasn't bad except for the fact that it did taste a bit over refrigerated.  A minor gripe is the airpot coffee...not freshly brewed...despite the espresso machine clearly visibile behind the counter.The pies are just over $4 per slice and ~$20 per pie.
4	They use no preservatives and no artifical oils. The crust on the pies, BOMB! Also there are no bi products such as corn glutens and starches.
