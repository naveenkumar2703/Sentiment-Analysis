4	Ladies here are very friendly, I've yet to see a male employee here.  I work close to here so I'm here pretty often.  Nothing stands out, as all branches of Starbucks are company owned and pretty are the same.  Extra star is for the extra care one barista took in ensuring I have the correct drinks.  Saved me a trip back!
5	How can you beat a Starbucks where everybody knows you.  Everybody is great and it's what keeps me going back when there are so many others I could be going to.
2	In a desert world even a muddy puddle  can be welcoming. So goes my feelings toward this Starbucks. I typically avoid Starbucks because of the burnt coffee and their franchise's political leanings. But sometimes they are the only place around. The wifi at this establishment was very bad, uncharacteristically so - it kept dropping every few minutes, streaming music or video was out of the question and IM was all but impossable. The service was fair at best, the coffee was as expected, and they began telling people to leave several minutes before their posted closing time. If in the area again...I WOULDN'T GO BACK.
