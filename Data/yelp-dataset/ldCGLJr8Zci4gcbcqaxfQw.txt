5	Not sue of the official open date but I noticed it open on 8/30! I've been patently waiting for a Jimmy Johns in this area! Thank you for opening a location here. Food was delivered in 14 minutes. Pretty damn good.Bread - FRESHToppings - FRESH & not sparseMeats - Delicious!I ordered online so I cannot review the customer service on the in store setting.
1	Tried to have Jimmy John's delivered tonight. Their delivery radius is so small that even being 1.34 miles away is too far for them. That must be how they have such fast delivery. They also lose customers quickly since they won't expand their delivery area. I'm sure another place will appreciate the business.
4	Always fast, clean, and the service is always good. I couldn't wait for this location to open so I could have fresh sandwiches delivered to me on matter of minutes. I'm definitely a sandwich lover and I love jimmy johns whole grain wheat bread as opposed to their white. Keep it up JJ crew!
1	Seriously I have two jimmy johns the same distance from me and neither will deliver. To me that's just a pathetic excuse to be lazy.
