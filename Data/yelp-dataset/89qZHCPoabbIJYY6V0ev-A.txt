5	When dealing with Justin and his team on plumbing issues, they are always straight forward and fair.  Not only does Service plus answer questions over the phone about plumbing issues in Las Vegas, they are prompt and have fair prices.  I would recommend Service Plus to family members!

5	Great service.  Quick and efficient. Thanks!
5	These guys really saved me! Over the winter we had a pipe burst one evening at our rental property and these guys not only told my tenants  how to turn the water off so no further damage was done but they were out first thing in the morning to fix it. Amazing costumer service and outstanding work and incredible prices ;)
3	Their service is okay, professional and friendly. However they charge for quotes even though their website states "free quote" plus they are expensive.
5	Great service, decent prices and Justin was a really great technician! Well informed and will be the company I turn to for all of my plumbing needs.
5	This company delivers incredible service again! I highly recommend them for your home's plumbing needs.
