4	Shabby Chic meets Alice in Wonderland. DO NOT consume magic mushrooms before entering here. LOTS of little fairies, butterflies, yard gnomes, inspirational signs that say "Your mind is your garden" and annoying things like that. It is a tiny tiny tiny little spaced crammed with such things. I feel a bit like Tony Shaloub from Monk as my anxiety intensifies from being in such clutter. But the flowers! Oh, the flowers. They are a sight to behold. And the staff and the owner are artists at what they do. Prices were not exorbitant as I expected. A great place to support. Non chain. And if you're lucky, one of the little fairies might even wink at you!
4	I tried Enchanted Florist for the first time yesterday, even though I've lived right around the corner for two years now.  I always love supporting local, non-chain, businesses, so I hoped Enchanted Florist could be my new spot to pick up flowers for my wife.  After my first experience, I think they will be!The owner stayed open late (they close at 5pm on Friday, which I was disappointed to hear) for me, which started the visit off just right.  She genuinely seemed to appreciate my business, and never made me feel bad for staying late.  She also helped me pick out the perfect bouquet, which my wife loved, so I can't ask for much more.  I thought the price for the bouquet - $34 - was a bit on the high side, but next time, I'll just be more clear on what I'm looking to spend.  The cost of flowers can get out of control pretty quickly.
5	Oh my. . . oh my!! I love my Valentine's Day flowers from Enchanted Florist! Candy too. Tulips, roses and some sort of white blossoms that are simply gorgeous. The vase is a keeper too. My husband did very well in choosing this florist.
1	BE CAREFUL, ONE OF THE WORST FLORISTS IN THE AREA.What a horrible experience !!! I ordered a $300 bouquet for my friend to be delivered for her birthday. I was supposed to be delivered at 10 am since she would be off work after 12 noon. They send her a smaller different (cheaper) bouquet that died the next day. The owner offered me 5% discount on the next order.
1	Do not even consider Enchanted Florist! What a disgrace! After speaking at length with Denise about my personal and sentimental order, it was delivered incorrectly. After assuring me she had lavender roses, the roses she chose to put in the bouquet were pink. As purple was the only stipulation I had in my order (besides no carnations and baby's breath) I was disgusted to see them in the picture sent to me. When I called Denise to inquire as to what happened, she was argumentative. She apologized at first and tried to blame someone else, yet offered to come by and replace the pink roses with purple. What?!?!? The moment was lost. I asked for a refund and she told me she "would lose money". I kindly asked her why she didn't make a simple call and explain that my ONE request of purple roses was out and she had no answer. The one call could have saved much aggravation and disappointment. Reasons to use a different florist:***not what I ordered******combative customer service******many other options***
1	Horrible customer service from "Freddie". I called back to speak with the owner but she said, "she wasn't available". She was so rude and had such a bad attitude. Don't waste your $$$$. Go to the floral department in Safeway on Hayden and Chaparral. They are kind, friendly, helpful and creative.
4	got a corsage from them the other day. they were very nice and helpful and really cared a lot about making sure i was happy.i did ask about their mixed reviews and they explained a new owner took over about 9 months ago. that makes sense since they really did seem to care about customer service (and did seemed bothered by their less-than-stellar ratings).give 'em a shot! they're good.
5	Excellent service and delivery, i called that morning and early that arternoon they were delivered and the flowers actually the roses were beautiful.
5	My sister moved to Scottsdale and just had a baby. I called two other places on yelp with higher ratings, no dice (actually, no one there). Finally called Enchanted around 330pm and they were not only able to deliver same day, they did it with a product of high quality.   Thanks guys!
5	Enchanted Florist is wonderful. I stopped by to pick up an arrangement for a friend going through a difficult time. The staff was helpful and attentive and I found the perfect arrangement at a reasonable price. Even better, the arrangement stayed fresh and beautiful for well over a week. I'll definitely be using Enchanted Florist again, and love that I can order online!
1	Worst flower experience ever. This place had very little options and the worker was extremely rude over the phone and in person. I will not be going back to this florist.
5	After trying three other flower shops, only two of which answered and neither having the flowers I was looking for I came across Enchanted. I have no idea how or why I never stopped here. Driving home from work I stopped in just before they closed for the day and was met with a friendly, very attentitive and helpful environment. Even with time ticking down I never once felt as if I was being rushed or a nuisance to the staff. They quickly gave me some suggestions and made my impromptu arrangement beautiful, looking as if it took all day to plan and arrange. I can't imagine what the arrangement would have looked like if I called the order in ahead of time. I will soon find out and will definitely continue to come to Enchanted for any and all of my floral needs.
5	I use the Enchanted Florist for all my floral needs. I can always find something just right for the occasion there, and the staff is always attentive and helpful even during holidays when they are extremely busy. I find their location in old town Scottsdale to be really convenient, and have also used their online ordering and their delivery and received stellar service with each. When something floral is the order of the day I always visit the Enchanted Florist.
5	Today I picked up some corsages & boutonnieres I ordered for the little children in our Sunday School program.  I mentioned that the little girls were really "little", the lady made note, and put together the most gorgeous tiny wrist corsages you've ever seen.  I  take great pleasure in writing to say my visit to your Florist was greatly enhanced by your staff, I passed a couple of other Florists to get to the Enchanted Florist...you made all the difference in the world to the children who will receive the flowers.  You have created a business which serves we the community with efficiency, professionalism and distinction...thank you.  Janet Dorris
5	OK. I waited until the last minute for Valentine's Day.I tried a couple of other shops that were closer to my target address, however, they either didn't answer, or didn't call back. I am on the other side of the country from my gf, so had no way to walk in to a shop and set it up, or do it myself.The I called Enchanted Florist. THEY WERE AMAZING!! Not only did they say that they could do the delivery, but because my gf works the early shift at her job, they had to guarantee morning, The next day, when she called to tell me she got them, she was elated at how beautiful they were...and she called early, which meant that they kept their word.Oh, and they didn't make me pay a premium for the promise, either. Good Karma!Enchanted Florist will be the only shop I use, in the area, from now on. Period!Thank you EF for being who you are.
5	My mother was recuperating from surgery. I called from out of state to order an arrangement that was unique.  The staff was very helpful.  Enchanted Florist created and delivered an arrangement which delighted my mom with its craftsmanship and  beauty.
5	Extremely good  customer service and I was very pleased with the design and quality of the flowers that I had sent to my daughter. Their prices were the most reasonable of several I searched, you are always a bit leary but no worries were needed, it was one of the nicest arrangements I've had delivered, so pretty, very creative design, I will definetly make them my florist of choice in the Phoenix area!
5	My son was in need of getting a boutonniere for his boyfriend for prom, and even though he loved the florist we went to last year he was wanted to try something new. So got out my handy Yelp App and looked up flower shops and Enchanted Florist popped, we were sold on the name itself, how cute is it, and it said it was only 4 miles from our place (really more like 10 but it didn't matter). Walked into the shop and loved what we saw, such a cute little place, we were helped right away, service was friendly and helpful with ideas, my son was asked what is he looking for, he described it, and they said ok!  He wanted something beautiful and regal, white rose with baby breaths and lots of green. Then my son asked for the price and it was less than 13 bucks! Couldn't believe it! Picked up the flower the following weekend and it was just what he wanted!  Glad to have found Enchanted Florist and look forward to using them throughout the year.
5	We ordered flowers for a dear friend going through a rough time. Enchanted florist was able to create a beautiful and unique arrangement and have it delivered very quickly after calling. They emailed me a picture of the arrangement and it was perfect. I really appreciated how easy they were to work with and how quickly they delivered the arrangement to my friend.
5	Quick, friendly, & very reasonable! Next time I need an arrangement quickly & professionally done- I will go here.
5	What a great little flower shop! I wanted to get some flowers for my girlfriend just because she deserves it. I was able to call them and pick the flowers up ten minutes later. The flowers looked beautiful and exactly what I wanted for a great price! They were very professional and quick to complete my order. I would recommend them to anyone for any occasion. Professional and quick all for a great price and beautiful arrangement! Also, they deliver same day!
4	I was surprised with the way the flowers i ordered were arranged! It was nicely done! The lady who owns this place seems really sweet too. I will definitely come back to order flowers from here again!
5	I ordered flowers for my anniversary. I was a little concerned about how good the flowers would turn out so I asked for a picture. They sent me this picture and it was beautiful. The flowers were amazing and my wife loved them!Thank you LanaGreat customer service!
5	I was in town with my wife for a funeral.  We had a last minute order of funeral flowers from Enchanted Florist.  They prepared a funeral easel in the shape of a cross.  The flowers were beautiful.  I was very surprised at how fast they put it together.  We were really in a bind and they came through for us within a few hours.I have to thank Lana for doing such a great job.  The family also enjoyed the flowers and it was nice that they were thankful for the flowers.  We live in a different area and probably won't be in the area to buy more flowers however they still treated us like family.  I just can't tell you how pleased we were with the service and our friends response.  Thanks again!
