1	they will show you pictures of doctors work that supposedly work there ....they dont ...well kinda personal info about me but lets just say $8000 and two surgerys later im still screwed up and in pain looking for a new doctor beware of these liars
1	Very rude and unprofessional staff. You can spend almost $3,000 and they will give you some materials and stuff for after surgery that will last maybe for that day, and if you ask for more you are told you have to pay more! Talking simple stuff under $10 that they have loads of and would be hard to go to the store after surgery to get, but they could simply throw it in after spending 300x that. They care nothing about anyone besides how much $ they are making off of you. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
