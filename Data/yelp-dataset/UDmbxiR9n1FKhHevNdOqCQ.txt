2	I went to this place once and the owner tried to sell me a large box, for shipping a guitar, for 30 dollars! My Wife has been in there before, and the Dude is really surly, terse & laconic. He has hired some youngsters who seem friendly and helpful- Had to pick up a fax from an insurance agent there recently- But, I wouldn't go out of my way to do any business there!
2	It's a "UPS" store.... you bring in a package... they take it... you wave goodbye to it... you leave.Sometime after that a big Brown Truck arrives and wisks said package off to its destination. This UPS Store was unremarkable... the guy behind the counter did his job... nothing more nothing less.
3	If you plan on going underground, this is the place to have your mail sent. You can rent a box for about three hundred a year....that's for the big box. Smaller ones are less, but your monthly copy of 'Jugs' will get all scrunched-up in the smaller one.They also give you a key to the front door so you can get your mail when they're closed. When no-one is around. Lurking in the parking lot.There are no cameras either, making that disguise thing unneeded as well,This is hugely important for the guy or gal hiding out from someone you think has a propensity toward wielding sharp objects, loaded weapons, or just has razor sharp fingernails that hurt like fuck.Fucking four foot anti-christ of a bitch.Rhetorically speaking of course.
5	I always remark to myself about the professional demeanor of the people who work here.Walt runs a tight ship.
