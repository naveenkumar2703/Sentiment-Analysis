3	I'm torn! They make my favorite fast food pizza, the Hawaiian BBQ pizza,,,, mmmmmmm!!! Unfortunately I find that whether I do carry out OR delivery, I end up having to reach deep into that reserve of patience that most keep around for times such as these. This is a fairly new store & maybe they have an all new crew & just need to find their grove, I don't know. I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt for a while longer :)
2	Whatever you decide, delivery or carry out its slow. I ordered a large pizza with pepp,mushrooms and xtra cheese and the order taker said "huh" I said my order again and she passed the phone to someone else. Ugh!At least the pizza was good.
2	Gave us a coupon to use based on incorrect order. Tried to use coupon just a few weeks later and said this store does not accept that specific coupon. So why did you give it to us? Won't deliver to us even though we're only 1.4 miles away. Not worth the hassle just go to NYPD. At least the second time the pizza was made correctly.
2	1.8/5 stars - Only reason to get this pizza is if you are a college student and only have 5 bucks. But let's face it even crappy pizza tastes good.
