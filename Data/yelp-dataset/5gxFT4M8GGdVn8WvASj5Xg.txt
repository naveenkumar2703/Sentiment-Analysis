4	I love this gamestop! Some of the male staff can at time be rude but I have never had any problems with the female staff. The store is always clean and the games are well organized.
4	It's not as bad as the previous reviews say. I mean how bad can it be? After all, they sell video games.
4	I come here usually to trade in games and get different used ones, I'd say the prices are fair. Every time I've been here the employees have been friendly and very helpful with any questions I've had.
3	I usually go to the one located on Dysart and Mcdowell but this one was much closer at the time when I was running errands. I'm going to just stick to going to the other one. I had bought an item here and when I used it, it began to malfunction. I was going to return it for another one but didn't feel like going through it again and they had a limited supply for headsets. Also the guy who sold it to  me had a bit of an attitude when I returned it and isn't very customer service friendly.
