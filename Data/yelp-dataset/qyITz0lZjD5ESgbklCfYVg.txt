3	Coffee is made here, sandwiches are not. Ordering 2 coffees and 1 sandwich, I asked for soy in the coffee, 1 hot peppermint mocha and 1 iced chai and some how received a cold peppermint mocha and hot chai both with soy. I couldn't taste the peppermint in the mocha, not sure if it was served cold is the reason. The sandwich, I requested it to be cut in half and made without cheese, the lady responded back with the sandwiches are pre-made. I'm just wondering how long before was it made? At least the second lady who was making the coffee let me take 2 apples from the basket. If you are short on time and can't run out to a different location, this is the spot for you. If you are able to get out and have time to stop somewhere else, I would do that instead. Service may be kind of slow too.
3	***E Go Cafe is located in the Renaissance hotel and their Greek yogurt parfait is pretty good--topped with sweet and crunchy granola, good candied pistachios, and fresh fruit; unfortunately, the lines can really build here (due to its small size and kitchen) and the prices are high (but that is kind of the case with food in Las Vegas)***Like most hotels in Las Vegas, the Renaissance hotel offers both valet and self parking.
3	Coffee is fresh and ready but the sandwiches are pre-made and meh. Everything is grab-n-go which is fine, but because it's in the hotel, it's over-priced and makes you feel kinda like they could have at least asked your name first before they...well you know. Convenient though and the Illy coffee is pretty darn good!
