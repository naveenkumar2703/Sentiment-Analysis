4	Candles, Candles, Candles, 2 for 22 again for the 3 wick candles. Selection was huge....staff was awesome.....store was very well organized. I would not expect anything less due to the fact that it is located in the quarters......Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
4	Great experience and customer service.
2	I wasn't all that impressed with the customer service or the current stock. I was disappointed to see they were only selling a few wallflower bulbs and only the singles. Their products consist mostly of personal care (lotions, bath items) at this location. I also was not able to locate my coupon and had trouble connecting to the internet to see if there was a coupon code via an email. A store clerk stood there for a few minutes knowing what I was desperately doing and did nothing to help me. She just stood there staring at me. No offer to help. Just stared. Needless to say, after minutes go by of staring and myself not connecting to the net, I was uncomfortable and left without buying a single item.
4	This is a nice store! One of the girls came up and showed me their sparkly mist/spray. It was pretty neat. Great customer service and selection.
