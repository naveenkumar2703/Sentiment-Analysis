1	Unfortunately Dudley Cameron has an uneducated & untrained woman at his front desk reception who has no idea what customer service skills are. She was completely rude an unprofessional with every response she conveyed to me. It was so intolerable that i had to walkout of there instead and didn't receive the treatment that I really needed. This business has lost me as a customer and if Dudley Cameron would like to keep future customers then I would suggest replacing this person with someone who has people person skills because after all, "the customer is always right."
5	Great gentle care and doesn't expect you to comeback needlessly.  Reception girls are happy and nice.  I've been going 2 yrs. and will never go anywhere else.
4	I have been coming here for my back adjustments every two weeks for the better part of six months now. Almost immediately I noticed a big difference. My first treatment was such a new experience that I actually hurt for a couple of hours after. But aside from that I noticed that I slept that night. Having suffered with frequent insomnia caused by some musculo-skeletal pain and discomfort in the weeks leading up to that, my new found sleep was very much a welcome addition to my life. Cameron Dudley is great at what he does. He helps me a great deal and I look forward to my bi-weekly adjustments. And he is kind enough to accomodate me for those occassions that my back is hurting when I am not even scheduled for an appointment. He is friendly and personable as are his front office ladies. They know me by name by now and that makes me feel welcomed there. I was skeptical of chiropractic care when I first started but I have been converted and it is very much thanks to these good folks.
