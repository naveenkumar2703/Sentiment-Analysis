5	I haven't used this place yet but I stopped in with a friend who was looking for some glasses and I was impressed.It's just a small store in metro center mall but they have some great frames. The guy who runs the joint helped us out and made suggestions on frames to fit her face and similar selections to those she liked. He really knew his product.He also had great knowledge of the prescriptions and what he could do with each frame shape and size. he was a tad eccentric which added to my belief that he is a goddamned genius. I took a few extra cards from him to hand out. I will definately be going back for my next pair of glasses. The prices are also more than reasonable.
5	Very customer friendly. My inlaws have gone through LEE for years, then for my husband and his sister, and now Im going there too.  He usually has some of the best prices, and unlike most places, they do the glasses in store! You might have to wait a couple hours or a day, but no where near the waiting time if you were to go to a place like Nationwide Vision who I used to go to.  They are very knowledgeable and are concerned about what you need.
3	Friendly service, fair price. Not huge selection, but found what we needed. We got our glasses in under an hour.
5	I bought several pairs of glasses from them: always stylish, friendly service and high quality. In fact, tomorrow I am going to buy my fourth pair from them. I find their prices competitive and good, European well-made frames.Really like them for glasses and they'll bargain on cost. Going in the next few days for my first eye exam there. Will let you know what I think.
