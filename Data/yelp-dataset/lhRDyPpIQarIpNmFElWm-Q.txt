5	The store manager is a Las Vegas native and extremely well spoken. He makes you feel right at home with a very polite and courteous approach to how he carries his business. The store is clean and crisp with lots of inventory to choose from. This store is a great addition to downtown and is a MUST VISIT for anybody who's local. REP LVCK!!!
5	Awesome location in downtown Las Vegas @ container park on the 3rd floor. Owner is down to earth and easy talk to. He treats everyone like you're part of his LVCK family. I bought the LV Bets Tee, just one of many items that caught my eye. Look forward to going back regularly and checking out what new lids and other gear they have. Make sure you stop here, you won't regret it.
5	The owner has done a great job building and creating a culture around this store. The service is great and the selection is even better. You can find a lot of local and out of state brands carried here. Not your typical retail store.
