1	I would be very very cautious of this company.  I was contacted to start work through them.  They actually did not have any work.  They don't talk with the companies that they are supposed to work with, instead just leave you hanging with no explanation (or offer you another job hundreds of miles away from home.   Never again!
1	Stay far away from this company. You will waste countless hours on endless paperwork, forms, tests and still never get a straight answer about being able to go out and cover shifts. Been on the registry 5 weeks and not one shift. They use several different phone numbers from the west coast and southwest region and seem to pride themselves on it. The number you dial might be long distance, but the person you are talking to is probably sitting right inside the Phoenix Office. Also, their office is no longer on 44th st. It is on 30th st and Camelback.
2	I am nurse who tried to get a job with them and they said they would return my call multiple times, but never did. Just from those two interactions I decided to prevent any future headaches. They seem disorganized, and passed me off to multiple people. Last I heard a nurse case manager with pediatrics and geriatric background willing to work weekends was in high demand....
1	This company has moved but never changed their address on their website.  Their new address is 3131 E. Camelback Road, Suite 200, Phoenix, AZ  85016. Their phone number is 602-508-1883.  They are located at 32nd Street and Camelback.
