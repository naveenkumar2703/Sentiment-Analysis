4	Had a mini emergency and they got me right it.  The vet was great with my cat and the staff was amazing.  They have a great price and wellness package that I got that covered everything my cat need plus her shots when she needs them.  I will miss my old vet but this is so much closer and they where great.  If you live in the South Phoenix or Laveen area this is a great place to take your pets.
1	If only i can write with negative stars i would do so, check our story of frustration and save your self from all the hassle that this place offer.This summer we got a cute maltese po, we wanted her all taken care of, so we went and got her their wellness plan, plus a whole year plan with heartworm and their ticks and fleas. The nurse who help us when we were choic
5	Dr Agnew is awesome! She goes above and beyond in treating your pets. My hound was the first entropian surgery that she performed. Her care, attention to detail and follow up was the best that we could have hoped for. All 3 of our pets are treated by her and she knows each one's problems and history  even before I have to tell her.  I would recommend her to anyone and everyone.
3	qualified vets and techs with a lot of patience to talk to patient owners but it is well known that Banner is very revenue focused and not necessarily suggest things that are not needed but if you took your pet to a private practice you would get just as good care and pay less.
