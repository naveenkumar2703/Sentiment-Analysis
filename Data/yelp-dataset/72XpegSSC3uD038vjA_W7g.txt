3	While I wish AYW was a little cheaper, they are a fun place for the kiddos to express their creativity.  The staff is, for the most part, friendly and helpful.  A few times, the younger female staff have been more preoccupied with chatting among themselves, but that doesn't appear to be the norm. Turn around time on the pieces is quick, just a few days, which is nice.
4	If you are ball'n on a budget this place isn't for you! They typically have pretty good deals floating around but for the most part the pottery is pretty expensive. On top of that you have studio time which is the cost for using their facility & paints. Enough about draining the wallet, Let's talk about customer service & memories. This location is always very helpful and we have never had any issues with them. My daughter loves coming here and we have created some wonderful pieces as well as some awesome memories so this place is definitely on our return and do list
3	Kind of expensive, was looking for something fun to do with my son and wife on a sunday afternoon.  The shark bank we created came out great, my son had fun, but it was a little pricey. We had a coupon from a clipper ad that came to the house, which helped with affordibility.  May return but next time i'll be prepared with ideas. You could really make some cool keepsakes
3	So much fun and a fantastic idea, but so expensive.  My sweet pea painted two tiny ceramic pieces, a jet and a puppy, and our bill was $25. While he did enjoy it, this is not something we would do on a regular basis despite how much fun we had.
4	It was fun but it was a little pricey. It's my niece who wanted to go and it was her birthday and she had a good time so that's all that matters. It's a great birthday gift. A great activity for family and friend.
