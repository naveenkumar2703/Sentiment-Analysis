3	It's a Target, what do you expect?  There's a grocery store, a Starbucks and a snack bar with really good popcorn.  It's all around, A-OK.  Except the popcorn, it's better than the movie theater bs.The staff is more meh than A-OK.  Once I was looking for stroller/carrier combo off a baby registry list which said there were 3 in stock.  When I couldn't find it I went back to customer service and they took the registry from me and pointed to the aisle.  When I told them it wasn't there and asked if they had more elsewhere, they said no.  On another visit I asked to be directed to the gift wrap aisle and I was told they didn't have one.  You're better off not asking questions when you come in here.
4	Usual Super Target. You can get just about anything here, and it's more upscale than Wal Mart. Haha
