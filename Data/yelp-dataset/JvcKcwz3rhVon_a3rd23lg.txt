1	I authorized work on Tuesday, they estimated it would be finished "Early next week."  I called Monday they said Tuesday.  I called Tuesday they said Wednesday.  I called THURSDAY and they said maybe later.  IF they finish Thursday I won't be able to get it till Friday!  (What, the customer has a schedule too?)  Why is the repair business so often a license to steal your time?
1	Do not believe there warranty for as long as you own the vehicle.  I thought that meant well if there is a problem with the paint they would just say okay well get it fixed.  Oh no not this shop.  They have to have the paint company come out which is((((  PPG)))) to see if it was there paint or clear coat.  Wow sound like I have to jump through hoops.  These guys are a joke.  Don't go here I promise you will regret it.
