4	Dolce Vita Coffee has grande caffe.  Also molto piacevole people who make your coffee with care.  Orgoglio=pride according to freetranslation.com.  You'll find it here.Even though this is a newer establishment I felt like the gentlemen preparing my espresso drink was old school.  Care was obviously taken with the preparation of the drink.  Ah, coffee as art form...fantastico!The atmosphere is neat and casual with outside seating.  They also have a small selection of gelato.  I'm not sure if the owners are from Italy but I would not be surprised to find out they are.Free wifi doesn't hurt either.Dolce Vita is located in the same shopping center as Sprouts, in the corner.
5	This place is amazing!!! I walked in and first thing I see is freshly baked chocolate chip cookies coming out of the oven..of course I couldn't resist when offered one!I ordered 2 tall cafe mocha's with 3 shots (no extra charge) for 2.95 each. I have been looking for a local coffee place that makes cafe mocha's that I like better than Starbucks, and this is the place!!I will never return to Starbucks with this place in the neighborhood!!I also ordered a lemon blueberry muffin that was also very delicious! .......I came back to this place for lunch, and ordered the Italian sandwich as is....No more subway or quiznos for me!!This place is again spectacular!! I will be eating here for lunch a couple times a week most likely!Love it!
