5	Now this is what Phoenix has been needing. Green sustainable courier service! This company rocks downtown Phoenix and the valley! Well done indeed!!
5	I work at a Thai restaurant around the corner, and our restaurant has Bike Force deliver for us. All of their riders are quick and as a restaurant we don't ever have any problems with them. We have quite a few regulars who order delivery and they all comment on the great customer service. These guys are awesome to have in downtown Phoenix.
5	Theses guys are the best.  BikeForce has a bike mechanic on staff now. Joel... he's fast reliable and priced very competitively.  If you need your bike worked on my vote is BikeForc.
5	Fantastic courier service that is competitively priced, friendly and fast! I will definitely use them in the future!
5	I work at the Downtown Salon Phoenix so we use these guys a lot to bring us yummy food so we don't have to go out in the heat...they are super fast I recommend them to everyone...Nick is my awesome he's super friendly and has a great smile
