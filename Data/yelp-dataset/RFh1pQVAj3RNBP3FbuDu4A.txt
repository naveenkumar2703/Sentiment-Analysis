2	Do you like brand names printed clearly in bold across your clothes?Do you feel like there is no in between dress phase between sweatpants and hoodies and skimpy dresses covering the mere basics?Do you feel misunderstood and have to hide behind bright or dark hoodies and sweats?Xile is here for you and your individual (not) style.
4	Ok so Xile can be pretty 'in your face' but at the same time it has some really good things. For example...I had been hunting high and low for a particular Barbour jacket (don't judge me, it has good insulation). They had run out in the Barbour store, in Jenners and everywhere else practically, but low and behold Xile had it!! And they gave me 20% off because I asked for a discount. SWEET!They stock the big boys, like Barbour, Ugg and all the other big names that are quite cool. Trust me, it's worth a look!
