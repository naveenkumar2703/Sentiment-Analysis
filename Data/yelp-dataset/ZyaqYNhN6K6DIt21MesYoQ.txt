4	This is about as close to good New York style thin crust pizza as you will find in Madison, served up by crusty italian, greek and oirish New York dudes.
4	If you see Don Nafi tell him his uncle said hello.  Don't worry but its an inside joke.  If you go to Casa Biance you'll see lots of east coasters eating there.  Its the best pizza in Madison.  Don Nafi owns the place and used to work at the place across the street from Parthenon.  He's a hard core Italian from NY and he knows how to make pizza.  The pizza here is much better.  I think my friends and I ate here 4 to 5 times per week.  Its as good a solid authentic NY slice you'll get outside of the east coast, not just in Madison.
5	Seriously the best pizza this native New Yorker has had since moving to The Land of Beer and Cheese 9 years ago.  And if you go for dinner, do NOT pass up the bread.
5	Casa B's has the best pizza in Madison, bar none.  The slices are gigantic, and the crust is absolutely perfect.  I can also recommend the Pasta Alla Nafi, which has a tomato cream sauce, chicken, and artichoke hearts.  Fantastic!  The Junction Road location is much nicer than their old downtown location was, though I really miss being able to walk from the UW campus for a slice.
