5	great pizza and cheez bread, so tasty......delicious!!!!!
3	garlic bread is cheesy....
4	This is a fun spot to watch games and eat good bar food. They usually have some kind of raffle giveaway during big games too, which I've won a couple times :) ! I come here for the burger though! I swear it is the best I've had in Vegas..... very random, I know. You can "create your own" with type of cheese, sauce, bun, etc. I always get a burger cooked medium with swiss cheese, sauteed mushrooms, and hickory smoked bbq sauce on toasted sourdough. It is soooo good!!! with a heaping amount of fries! My boyfriend swears by their pizzas, which are also delicious! Overall this is a good spot to play video poker, get good drinks by a very friendly staff, watch a game, eat a great burger, and play elvis pinball!
4	Another neighborhood watering hole of mine - I love that they have a mini game room and a shuffle board table.  Try the pizza and catch a game or two.. they have a ton of screens.  I also think they have quiz nights on Tuesday nights.. but don't quote me on that.
4	Typical sports bar but a good place to watch a game and enjoy a great meal. Garlic Knots are tasty. The pizza is fantastic!!
5	Great place to watch football games in Vegas. Great staff with a great menu. A bit off of the strip but its worth the 5 minute drive south on Vegas Blvd.
