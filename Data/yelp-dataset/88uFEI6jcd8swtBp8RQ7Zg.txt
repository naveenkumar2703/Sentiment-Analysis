3	Really expensive! I paid over $200 for 2 pairs of gym shoes. They do have really friendly staff. Try shopping online and using a promo code for saving.
1	Worst staff ever. Bad customer service. NEVEVE AGAIN!!! I wish I could give them 0 star for this rating.
5	Love this store. Every time I visit I get excellent service and always leaving spending more then I should. Rosa was a great help
