3	Attached to a Shell station and a convenience store of all things. And it's a drive through. What more do you need? And the wi-fi worked great while we filled up the car!East of Phoenix/Mesa on Route 60, this is truly the last stop / first stop from the nothing that lives between Phoenix and the Superstition Mountains.
2	Slowest McDonald's I have ever been too. Nice staff but slow. Literally sat in line in drive through 10-15 mins at the window on three separate occasions. If you go inside it's worse.
3	Packaged food and gas? Great! Hot food and restrooms? Not very good.
3	A bit slow..
1	Slow as fudgesicles.
1	Only because you can't give it a half star.  Terrible employees,  dirtiest McDonald's I have ever seen.   Lousy service.
