4	Typical panda express. Great orange chicken and chow mein.  Everything is fresh and just hard to beat when you want this style food fast.  I am just glad they have one closer to us in the further out areas of Queen Creek.
3	Typical Panda Express.  Reasonably tasting fast-food asian food.  Very happy to see them in Queen Creek.  Quickest and cheapest asian in the QC.
3	What do you really expect from a review on a chain? It's notoriously known fast food chains aren't the peak of 5 star dining. So to review based on the food... eh, kinda pointless.  So I usually review based off of everything else. It was pretty dead when my wife and I went in to kill time before her students science fair. It was clean. The staff was out in the dining room wiping down tables and sweeping when no one was ordering. They were also friendly and welcoming. I think we had good timing because the food didn't look like it had been sitting there all day. Plus, Panda is the only place that has the best peach Brisk tea.
3	same panda as everywhere else. fast, decent chinese. keep your expectations where they should be.
