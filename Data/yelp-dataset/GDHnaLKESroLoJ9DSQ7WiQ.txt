1	This location sucks if you have have to go inside. The lines are always too long. They have room for 7 tellers up front but I've only ever seen 2 working. Managers and "personal bankers" never jump in to help yet you see them walking around or sitting at their desks.
1	I stopped in today to close an account and transfer it to another account. After waiting in line behind 8 people and two tellers I am finally told oh you have yo go sit down and talk to someone.  So I go sit down where she told me and waited to be called. I'm sitting for about 5 mins when the two guys are sitting staring into space. Another guy comes in and gets greeted by a greeter. Which by the way, I was not greeted. This guy takes him right to the someone. I sit and wait some more and the greeter is standing there. He sees me sitting and there and two men sitting doing nothing. I finally get up and say this is ridiculous and I open the door to walk out and the greeter just says have a nice day. I should have known better than to go in this location.**Update**  I called the bank just to find out why my reported lost credit card has not gotten here yet. I was told there were notes in the account but nothing done.  The incompent people of this company is sad, yet almost funny.I am closing my accounts today!I give them negative 2 stars so perhaps we need another way of grading these places that don't deserve a star.
1	This is the worst bank I have ever been in.  My company banks here so I have no choice. I would never put my personal accounts here.  They have a " business banking" line, and today the teller was doing work for one of their officers and completely ignored me.  Three other people came in after me and were taken before me.  I walked out without having my deposit made. I will do all I can to get my company to switch to another bank.  This branch does not understand customer service at all.
