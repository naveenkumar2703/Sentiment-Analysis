1	The store has expanded from a Kiosk to a full location within the mall.  Regrettably the customer service has not.  I went in to purchase some accessories as well as asking for some assistance with my (2 day old) new modem.  The sales rep was unprofessional, rude,  argumentative and unhelpful.  So much so I drove across town to another location to resolve all my issues.  On the plus side my 4G service so far has been satisfactory.  So while I am not criticizing the company as a whole, I strongly recommend you shop somewhere else for your Clear needs.
1	Avoid this wireless Internet company. Their service is horrible, and trying to cancel is even harder. All you get is the runaround. It's not worth your time.
1	NO RECEPTION! 4G is hard to find, has no 3G service! Doesn't work at Macarren Airport in Las Vegas!  Doesn't work Ventura CA, Doesn't work in Thousand Oaks CA, very spotty coverage throughout California and Las Vegas, I wouldn't use this again... Lost money with my business depending on this worthless router.  I spent the whole day hopping around coffee shops because this router is always flashing red trying to find a 4G signal. Virgin mobile's 3G data router is better if you must have one.
1	Clear has THE worst service ever. It took several devices(they tried to charge shipping each time) for me to get a near working device...((ROVER PUCK)) and the other "pocket" device are horrible, the connections are horrible, especially when you are working on something important. So I stopped my service months ago, when I moved back to SF Bay, where it stopped working...and yet they are STILL trying to harass their  way back into my wallet. Non-stop calls, emails and the like...you'd be better off with something else....
