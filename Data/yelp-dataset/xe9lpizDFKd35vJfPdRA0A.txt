2	Merchandise and set up is Typical Aldo. Usually the staff at Aldo is annoyingly persistent about trying to get you matched up with a pair of shoes for $49... seems like ALL their shoes are $49....Anyhoos, I had to track somebody down to assist me... then I had to persuade them to let me buy the shoes. If hadn't NEEDED these shoes I would have just gone to another shoe store.
5	ALDO is the best! I don't buy shows from them very often, but hand bags.... YES PLEASE! All of my favorite bags come from ALDO. They last pretty well too, I over use them for sure, so I shorten their life but by no fault of their own then the fact that they are so cute!They also have awesome sales all the time. Last purchase was a beautiful cream/pink leather tote, its huge, i get made fun of, but I do not care! She is beautiful! And perfect for carrying my "junk" and tablet. Must check them out!
