5	Owner was nice and waived the notary fee since I was sending something priority overnight, he then found a way to get my package out that day, even though it was past the 5:15 cut-off time.
1	Brought a friend to this store to ship a pkg to her daughter for her birthday.  The counter person, Bill, would not ship her pkg because she could not read and verify the address that he had on his printout.  My friend told him that she could not read it, not that she wouldn't, but she could not.  She had the address on the pkg, but he needed her to look at his printout and verify the address. He told her that he would not ship the pkg unless she did this.  My friend cannot because she is legally blind.  He would not help her and refused to send the pkg.
4	I love that I could just walk into this store with a dress, tell them I needed to ship it and they took care of the rest.  They got the right box, packed up the dress and all I had to do was give them the address.  And now they don't even ask you to fill out that order form.  You just give them the address and they enter it right into their computer!  Adding insurance on the package was easy and cost effective.  They really make shipping a no hassle experience.  They also send you and email with the confirmation and the tracking number for easy tracking later.
1	Just spent $25 to send a UPS package, They say the also take USPS. I asked to drop off my pre-paid USPS package in their outgoing mail. They said they would only do it of a $1 fee. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I just spent a bunch of money and you want to charge me $1 just to place my package in an outgoing pile for USPS. Worst customer service ever. Way to build loyalty. I will never do business in this store again.
