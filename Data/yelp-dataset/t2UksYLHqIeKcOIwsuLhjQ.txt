4	Ummmm red velvet ice cream?  YES!!!!!  Great ice cream on a chilly phoenix afternoon.A little pricey, $5 schmoes for a kids cup.  Total for 2 adults and a toddler about $18.00 bucks.The chicks working the counter were super cool tho and I thought the overall vibe was nicer than ColdSlabCreamatorium.Thumbs up cats and birds...
