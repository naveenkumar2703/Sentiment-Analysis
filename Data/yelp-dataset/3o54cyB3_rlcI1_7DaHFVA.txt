5	Great Chimichungas and Carne Asada Burrittos!
2	I will try them again eventually and hopefully get better service. The Burrito was good but the chips and salsa was brutal. Service was shit though while I was the only person in the restaurant and the food was sitting finished behind the counter for 5 minutes when the help was too busy watching TV.
1	Food was not good.  Made Teach Bell taste like 5 star.  Carnitas were so tough they were like old jerky.  Will never be back!
1	Not good Mexican food. Very straight forward dishes done very poorly. Bland salsa, chile verde was bland, escabeche was lackluster. Very disappointing. The place was hot inside, drinks had no ice, service was apprehensive. One star is given for food being hot.I don't think this place will be around for long...
