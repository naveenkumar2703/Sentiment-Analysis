2	Clothing reasonable priced. Customer Service needs to improve. The two girls that were there, gossiping about how they hated working with another girl that worked there. I was greeted when I walked in but then was ignored.
1	I recently purchase three pairs of pants and three tops from the Avenue store in Mesa, AZ.  I am very disappointed in the quality and value of the merchandise.  It provides valuable insight into their return policy.  While shopping, I couldn't' help but notice the pricing and marketing schemes that Avenue employs.  Jacking prices up, only to mark them down "on sale" for the appearance of getting a good deal.  I wore the jeans once, and washed them.  When I pulled them from the washer, there was a hole in one leg and the decorative stitching was pulling out.  I took them back to the store, and the sales clerk informed me that because they were worn and washed, they could accept them as a return.  She said that the policy wouldn't allow it, because I may not have followed the labeled washing instructions.  Yes, I do read laundry instruction tags, and these were denim jeans after all- not something that would require special attention.  After some negotiating, she did agree to do an exchange for another item in the store, but that they could only do it this one time.  I left with the new pants and was "on the fence" about if I would be a return shopper.The next morning, on my way out the door to work, I noticed that one of the shirts I had also purchased, worn once and laundered also was fraying and had a faded spot.  That sealed Avenue's fate.  I will not be a return customer.
1	Time after time this store continues to disappoint. I needed a pair of shorts so I decided to try this store again. I had great customer service last week and it gave me hope that this store had turned around. I return this week only to find that the customer is not priority here. I will go back to shopping online.
