4	Good place to spend some extra cash. Very nice quality clothes and accessories. The staff is helpful and very positive. The layout of the store is a little overlooked, it has the feel of something missing. It has the good location, just that the front of the store is kind of plain and you could easily pass by it without seeing it.
