5	good service, fair price.  fidel (owner of the shop) worked at courtesy imports before -- if you need performance work done on Mazda or Mitsubishi, he's the man.  look nowhere else.(got my lowering springs installed by him just today)
5	This is officially my go-to shop whenever I need something done for my car whether it's for servicing, install aftermarket parts, anything. Ive come to this shop twice already, getting a spoiler installed, and just recently getting new LED tail light installed. Fidel always knows what to do as he's a very experienced mechanic (working at both Mazda and Mitsubishi) he's quick and can improvise pretty good. I'd recommend this shop to everyone that wants great and friendly service!
