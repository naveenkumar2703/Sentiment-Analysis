5	Finally a small family owned non-chain style business with homemade yummies!I was immediately impressed with the warm nature of the woman working there (owner?). She was incredibly helpful and went out of her way to suggest things and make sure were were taken care of 100%!Things I tried: Chicken bun.. simply shredded chicken in a homemade bun, but oh so delicious. Allegedly the dough is made on site and you can tell.. mmmItalian pasta salad... delicious, they make their own vinagrette. Chicken cordon bleu sandwich.. as good as it sounds!It was taco tuesday, the bf found the tacos very yummySmoothies were fresh and delicious ! They serve breakfast as well, and their menu was very extensive. Give this place a try, but it is a tad hard to find.. it's tucked away in a shopping center so you can't see it from the road.
1	I work in the office park where this place is located. I will eat there only out of desperation. In fact, this past Friday, I was short on time and skipped lunch rather than going there. Their food is mediocre at best. I think it changed hands in the Spring of 2008 and since then, portions are smaller, prices are higher, and I think the woman who appears to be the owner is irritating.   They charge you to pay with a debit/credit card. Also, their ventilation is not good, so you will leave there smelling like fried food.The old owners were very nice people and very fair. My only complaint with them was that the coffee was Douwe Egberts and was terrible.
1	Ohhh my god, This place is horrible.  If you eat here, you will smell like grease and smoke.  The food is all packaged and they microwave eggs for the love of god!!! The owners are very cheap and the portions are very small.  I hope this place is replaced by a Subway.. It will still be horrible but at least it wont cost as much.So this place was I think changed hands in 08 and that is the reason why its bad.  The old owners were so much better.
