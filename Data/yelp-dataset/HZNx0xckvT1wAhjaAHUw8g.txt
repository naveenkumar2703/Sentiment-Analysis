5	The best!
5	Really good music school that kids can learn music & dance lessons.  TheTeachers are very knowledgeable in their field.  Would highly recommend this school.
5	Situated in the heart of Buckeye, the Anderson Institute of Music & Performing Arts has by far the best music and performing arts instructors and equipment I have seen. I've been to several different music schools and performing arts academies.It's been awhile since my last lesson from AIM but I recently had the opportunity to tour the new various studios and their different locations. What was very impressive were the diversity of the studios. For people who want a creative environment that instills self-confidence, self-esteem, and teamwork without sacrificing the core values of dance as an art form, the AIM studio is that place. The AIM studio nurtures students of all ages, provides, high-caliber dance instruction, and creates a family-friendly atmosphere using the mediums of dance, music, and performance. As far as music is concerned, the instructors and staff are extremely friendly and helpful. My skills as a musician developed, as did my confidence, my abilities and taste in music. It wasn't long before I was able to not only understand the notes I've been playing but also read the music. I would have to say that deciphering the hidden messages in the music was like winning a secret war I never knew was there. I hardly ever give a business 5 stars but being able to understand, and play music as well as I do now is truly a testament to the equipment and instruction i've been given. I hope that one day, AIM will be able to provide instructional videos (at a low cost) as I now live hundreds of miles away and lack the instruction that i've been given at AIM.
