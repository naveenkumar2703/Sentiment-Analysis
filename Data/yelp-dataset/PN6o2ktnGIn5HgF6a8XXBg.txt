3	It's not the cheapest, but you don't get that many internet cafes in this area and if you want it cheap you'll have to trek over to Clerk Street.Despite it being reasonably expensive it does manage a decent amount of trade simply because it is one of the best in the area, especially for the amount of provided equipment.  It is expensive, but locally hard to beat.
3	I really don't understand how internet cafes survive these days with so many people owning their own internet connection and access available from public libraries and on mobile phones. I only found myself in there because my friend from London wanted to use a webcam to speak to his girlfriend via Skype. Here Internet did have these facilities but they are not on all of the computers, so make sure you ask an assistant which computers have the software installed on them.The layout of the store was ok, but nothing special. It offered snacks and drinks at slightly higher than average prices as well as coffees and teas. In terms of price, it was 80p per 15 minutes, which I guess isn't too bad if you are in desperate need of information and lack the facilities to obtain it.
4	It looks a bit of a shithole from the outside, and like most internet cafes nowadays feels very much like it might just be a front for a drug dealing / immigrant trafficking operation, but it certainly does provide a service, so I really can't fault Here Internet, apart from the poor and unimaginative name.Considering most people now have internet on their phones as well as their computer, it's obviously not a market that's growing rapidly. There'll always be enough students too stingy to chip in for broadband, people with broken PCs, and peasants to keep this place running though.
