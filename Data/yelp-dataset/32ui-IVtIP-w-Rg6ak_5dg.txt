5	DesignLine Architects has a lot to offer builders and residential or commercial property owners. They have an in-depth background in the residential market making them an asset to anyone requiring quality design services. We have been working with Doug Rusk the last two years on a number of both residential and commercial projects.  What we like about Doug is his attention to detail and his ability to integrate the customer's project requirements and ideas into a Conceptual Design sketch. He can take those sketches and  transfers that vision into working and construction documents.  BHB Remodeling & Renovation contractors are a growing firm in the greater Phoenix Valley and we are proud to be associated in expanding our relationship and creditability through the services of DesignLine Architects. DesignLine Architects - and especially Doug Rusk has extremely high business ethics and delivers quality design services that makes him a wonderful resource for any contractor, business owner, homeowner looking for architectural design services.
5	What initially drew me to DesignLine Architects was the very thoughtful, informative, and practical website.  Subsequently, in speaking and working with Doug it quickly became evident that he has a unique balance of inspired and creative design with practical application.  Doug quickly tuned into to our design aesthetic which he continued to inform and improve from concept design through to the creation of the Project Plans required by the City of Phoenix.  DesignLine Architects has a customer centric approach, provides a high level of customer services and I highly recommend them.
