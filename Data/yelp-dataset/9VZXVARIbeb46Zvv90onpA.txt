1	Unbelievably expensive. I paid almost twice as much for an oil change, tire rotation, and in-cabin air filter change than I did at the dealer for the same services a few months back. I won't be back for sure.
4	The good: nice clean waiting room. A fridge full of sodas, fresh baked cookies ( in a toaster oven) and a brew by the cup coffee machine are all there for you to help yourself. The service was fast! Tire rotation and oil change was promised in 20 minutes, I was out in 15!!! Did I mention it was really clean and nice?The Bad: a bit overpriced. $36 for an oil change, $15 for a tire rotation (they did give it to me for $10). Overall: I'll be back. 15 minutes in a Saturday is impressive and to pay a few bucks more o save an hour of my weekend is well worth it!
