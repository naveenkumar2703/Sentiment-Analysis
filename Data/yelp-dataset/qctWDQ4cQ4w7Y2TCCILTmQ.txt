4	LOVE this store. It has any type of craft you would need and it's local! There is nothing special about it, no frills...it hasn't changed in atleast 10 years. I used to love coming here as a child; I moved away, now that I'm back I realized that the same people are still working there. It must be a family, mom and pop type store and I love that.The only reason why it's not 5 out of 5 is because no one stopped to ask me if I needed any help. I even made eye contact with the lady and all she did was smile. However, when I asked for help, I was helped considerately and friendly.
5	Best  old fashioned 5 & dime store ever! Reasonably price, helpful staff. Best framing service in town! You guys ROCK!! I've taken my kids through their childhood, then through my crafting years and now with my grandchildren. Great Store!
5	I stop in often to pick up things for craft projects. The people are always friendly and I can almost always find what I need. Often times for less than the big box craft stores. I grew up going to this store and love the location. Easy to stop in and pick up a few things. Love it here!
