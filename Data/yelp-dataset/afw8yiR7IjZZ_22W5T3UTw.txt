5	Located in the Newtongrange area of Edinburgh The Scottish Mining Museum is something a little bit different to your average museum. A perhaps less glamorous industry and one that's less well known about today but nonetheless it's an industry that used to be very important and I think it's great that you can visit the museum and hear the facts and the tales about miners who make the 9-5 slog seem like a breeze.The gift shop is immense and when I visited with my mum a few years ago she bought me a little coal teddy bear - very cute.

Kids get to drive the wheel house at the end, which is pretty impressive even to my iPod-addicts.The exhibits on what is coal, how is it formed, why is it important - interesting and relevant.  The hands-on craft center was a lot of fun too.  Great.
