5	Located in the heart of downtown Phoenix, The Daily Grind is an awesome coffee emporium all around.This coffee shop is about as centrally located as they come.  It is right off the light rail route, not far from the ball parks, very near a lot of paid parking spots and right across the street from Duck and Decanter.The Daily Grind won me over from their name.  The double play on words is simple and clever.  Then, being located in the heart of downtown is awesome, as it allows for a lot of foot traffic to observe, not to mention the skyscraper construction.The space in this place is spectacular.  They offer plenty of small tables to sit down and plug-in at and the atmosphere is great.   The overwhelming red color inside makes you think for a split second you traveled into some time warp and landed back in 1980's Russia.I knew I was going to especially like it when I saw they offered complimentary WiFi.  They definitely know how to win a nerd's heart!  I managed to find a perfect table next to a window right next to a plug in...I could see myself sitting here all day inhaling espresso and working on writing projects.  The good music (Dave Matthews is playing as I type this) isn't going to make me want to leave, either.This was another selection for Phoenix #OpenCoffee, and I definitely plan on coming back.  They even have a coffee club car (buy 10, get one free).
1	Your clever double entendre of a name won't win me over "daily grind," if that is your real name. Honestly, there are so many excellent coffee and tea shops in the valley that it would be a waste to settle for this.
