4	Legacy West Park is a great park hidden along North Pecos.  A first glance, it appears to be a small neighborhood park tucked in between strip malls and neighborhood subdivisions, but walk around it a little and you'll realize that Legacy West does a lot with the space it sits on.The park has a nice open grassy area with picnic tables and trees, as well as a softball field, baseball field and tennis courts.  It's a great neighborhood park for folks near Pecos and the 215.  On warm spring and fall days, it's a fun place to take the family.And If you're a runner or cyclist, there's a great bike path / paved running path that runs right along the park for miles in either direction.  You've got to hand it to the Henderson city planners, they did set aside a fair amount of desert for parks and exercise space.
5	Spent a great evening here playing volleyball with old and new friends. The atmosphere is very inviting. There's a place for softball, volleyball, running, kids, a nice place to take your dog on a walk and I even saw some people doing yoga. Went spent most of out time in the volleyball pits. There was another game going on at the same time, but there was enough space to let us all have a good time. This place is the perfect way to spend an evening at the park.
5	Another awesome park in the Green Valley North area!Huge grassy areas, baseball fields that are always hosting kids' tournaments, sand vball (never seen it in use), a medium-sized playground, and tennis courts (which are busy when it's nice out). Overall, the place is never packed, and the pavilions with grills are a nice area for hosting events.It's adjacent to the Pittman Wash trail, so Legacy West is a nice spot to stop off for a break on your walk/run/bike ride.Bonus points for being in riding distance from my house!
