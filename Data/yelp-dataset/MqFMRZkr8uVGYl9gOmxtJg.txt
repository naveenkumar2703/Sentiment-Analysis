4	This is a rather large city of henderson park. There are two playgrounds here, lots of grass, large old trees (hard to find in the desert!), bathrooms, covered picnic areas, a huge ballpark with stadium seating, a skate park, and horseshoes. I like to bring my kids here with a picnic lunch and let them play onthe playground. Theres pigeons galore, and theyll steal your food if you leave it unguarded, so beware! usually the parks empty, which i like. Its big and well-kept. 4 stars it is.
2	Park is a little runned down in a older part of Henderson.  Would definitely not let the kids out of my sight for a second here. Other then for softball practice not a place I would cime
3	I used to play on this park when I was a kid.  The park has gone through a lot of changes over the years in an attempt to keep it up to date and not completely run down.  I think the fields are still pretty good for young players to play on.  The park (rides) have been replaced with newer ones that are the typical new plastic slides so kids won't hurt themselves.  I survived the old hot metal slides, not sure why kids cannot do that anymore, but the plastic slides are ok.  They added a skate park, and they have basketball hoops, tennis courts, and rec center onsite.  I think the bad part of the park is that it's location is not in the best area.  But, if you watch your kids like a good parent should, than their shouldn't be any safety issues here.
