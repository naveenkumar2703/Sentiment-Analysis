4	Do you know why I like this Subway? No. You don't. So let me tell you... Every time I come in here for lunch it's never busy! And it's not that people don't come in here, it's that the employees are really good about serving their customers. Some Subway locations are pretty hit and miss, but so far this one has been the most consistent.
4	Good food. Good service
5	I frequent this subway quite often. Sam and Wilson are always professional and beyond friendly. Sam has even learned what sub and cookies I always get. Great place.
3	My husband and I frequent this location quite a lot as it's fast and really close to home. Good points: like I said already, it's fast and the employees are generally really good. My major complaint here is that nearly every time we come here lately (it's generally around 5pm) they're out of items. Usually the items they're out of are cheese, provolone typically, spinach among others. Now to me this seems like the owner is being a little too cheap for a fairly busy location. It really needs to be well stocked and they're just not :(
