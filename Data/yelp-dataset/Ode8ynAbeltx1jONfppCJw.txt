5	Another Great Shop! The entire store is a walk in Humidor. Wall to wall selection, special orders, very knowledgeable staff and extremely reasonable prices.
5	Good selection and very friendly service.
1	Great staff but dry cigars wasted 20$ on two cigars that are as hard as a rock...very frustrating when you want to end the night with a good stogie
5	A True Treasure in the East Valley for Cigar Aficionados Are you tired of those "smoke shops" where the humidor seems like a second thought and is filled with overpriced stock that is past its prime?Well you're in luck!!   I was returning from my grocery expedition to the Mekong Plaza supermarket and taking Baseline instead of the 60 when I spotted this gem in a non-descriptive location.  A quick u-turn and I was inside ... and immersed in a total humidor!  Old friends greeted me and some new ones.  The woman behind the counter knew her products; what a wonderful surprise!If you like a good CAO Toro maduro wrapped or one of my standby favorites, Rocky Patel ... whatever your taste, this is the place!!Enjoy, (and there's a smoking lounge onsite)... enjoy!
