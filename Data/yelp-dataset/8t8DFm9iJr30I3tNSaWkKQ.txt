1	Food edible.  The staff there always seems tired and unhealthy.  Even for the Village Inn chains which are already pretty junky, this one is on the lower end of the scale.
3	Uninteresting. Not any different from Danny's or IHOP or similar. Tasted alright, was warm, relatively fast service. I do not know, what else would be there? I kind of was expecting something better then Danny's but was not really disappointed when it was not. It's alright, just do not expect anything special."Its alright"Eugene
1	This location is CLOSED. It's an empty building.I am only putting one star up because I have to in order to post.
