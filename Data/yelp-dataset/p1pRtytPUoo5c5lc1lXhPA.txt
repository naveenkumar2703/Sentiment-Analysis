4	I like this store, they have cute stuff for the twins.  One of the only places left at City North where you can shop.
4	Damn cute baby cloths. Great selection of stuff. Bit pricey but when you see you baby in the cloths it is worth it.
4	I loved this location. They had good inventory and always found more items than at PV Mall. So convenient and was happy to avoid the decaying PV mall. Anyway drove by on Jun 20th an the store is gone!  A shame.
