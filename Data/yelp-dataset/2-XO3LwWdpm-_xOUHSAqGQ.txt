1	Smelled much better from outside than in.  Taste was so poor, I will not be returning! Steamed rice was so flavorless! The noodles were flat-flavored... The only semi-decent part was the BBQ pork... And it was definitely not good enough to make me want to return-- ever! Just avoid the foods 2 go!
3	For a quick bite after leaving the market I would definitely give this place a try.  I did however NOT like it the first time I came here over a year ago but decided to try it once more.  Pretty good! Nice pricing and I would probably recommend when ordering the dim sum try getting there before lunch time because when we did everything tasted as it would fresh out if the steamer.  I am definitely a fan, not 5 star raving fan but still I would come back and get some more food from them if in the area.  I would however recommend that they elaborate on the dim sum selection.  It was delicious but not much variety.
3	Small hole in the wall Chinese joint right outside the International Marketplace. They sell mostly Chinese BBQ and combo mix plates Panda Express style. The food here is dirt cheap but is hit or miss depending on what you get. I'd stick with the BBQ combos though because the other food was ok. They also have dim sum items but I didn't try any. The dining area across from the restaurant is small and kind of dirty. I would only eat here again when coming to the International Marketplace...definitely not worth making a trip specifically here. Stick to Panda!
