3	My neighborhood post office...what can I say about a government venue with angry ex-military in a customer service role?
3	Not sure what you can say about a post office... I needed to mail a package on a Saturday, and looked up "post offices" on Yelp after taking a grad school exam. The directions were good and I found the place with no problem. This location, however, isn't open on Saturdays (the window). If you want to mail anything on Saturdays, you'll have to use the Automated Postal Center (APC) machine. This location is open only Monday through Friday. I don't live in Mesa, but judging from all the locals coming in asking what was wrong, I take it they're not used to this either. I stood in line a long time behind this lady who was mailing a litany of large envelopes...long enough to tell several people to read the hours posted on the outside doors. The post office is beside the Mesa airfield, and looks fairly new. I didn't have any issues other than expecting to be in/out and that wasn't the case. There's only one APC that I saw, so if there's one person with an armful of packages to mail, bring a book.
1	I dont like to bash places like this but I'm sorry.. I tried to call this place three days in a row with the phone just ringing for 5 mins and no answer. I am not sure what the deal is with this location but they need to clean house and get new employees in this place. Then when I tried to talk to somoene about the issue he said that only one person in the whole building answers the phone, the other employees do if they want to but they don't. SMH not to mention I stood in line for 15 mintues because only one window was open, while the other guy took care of stuff that could have waited.
4	It's a post office. . . Pretty boring really.Anywho, it's always here when I need it, so that's pretty cool.Overall a rather busy place, but they absolutely process quickly so as to help as many customers as possible in the time allotted, no dilly-dallying!
