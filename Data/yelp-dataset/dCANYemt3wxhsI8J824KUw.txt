2	This review focuses on the shrimp & fries meal:Just now I ate here. I was not impressed. I just got off work, and was running errands at McCarren Center. I was hungry and exhausted, and could not wait out the walk to the Walmart McDonald's.  So there in front of me was a Del Taco sign promoting a shrimp and fries meal. I can tell you that this was in reality average tasting fries with a few small fried shrimp. I should have taken a picture of it. As far as taste, I rate it on a par with a frozen dinner.   I have been to Del Taco in the past. In my opinion their cheeseburger is tasty. In general I will eat here when I get in the mood for their cheeseburger.

3	Yep it's a chain, like all other chains. Food is pretty good and cheap, fries are the best, soft chicken tacos on corn tortillas yummm!
