4	You want a nice and healthy but quick lunch to sit in or to go?It's a little hard to find unless you are on campus and desperate for a quick lunch.... but it's there - and it's my personal breathing space in the middle of the day. And it not only offers you lunch at a decent price between 3-5Pounds, it is authentic freshly prepared Thai food. The little shop with the neon green outside wall is a friendly cozy place. The staff are nice, always smiley and I am there mostly twice a week simple because their Tom Kha Gai soup is fantastic ... They are expanding into a restaurant in the basement (quirky) and if you don't mind that there are no windows you will have a nice Thai Dish for dinner.
3	I visited this wee restaurant last week with friends. I had made a reservation in advance for three people, and we were advised to arrive at 20:30 so that we can be attended better. However when we arrived, only a square table was available which you're being squeezed a bit to have three people there, the manager's apology/reply was that it was a busier evening than expected and some customers hadn't left yet. We did sit there and changed to a bigger table that became available later on. The place is BYOB which is not mentioned on the website nor were we informed about it when we made the phone reservation. The food was good, but nothing that would make a difference or give a genuine character. I found the rice portions a bit small for my taste.  The waitress wasn't aware for the dishes that had run out, but she was quite attentive for the rest of the night. I think this place has some potential, but, value for money, I think there are other places to consider and enjoy more.
5	I love this place!! Definitely worth coming for the lunch menu. I have gone in two occasions and on both food has been delicious and staff very friendly. The place is really small but I like the intimate feeling of it. Very good for a date or a group of 4 people maximum I would say.
