4	Seems to be the cheapest gas in our neighborhood. Lots of pumps, so you never have to wait. My only gripe is with the gas pumps, they have some kind of accordian looking nozzle on them, so if you don't have the nozzle perfectly in your tank, it'll pop out or stop filling. They take credit or debit at the pump with out charging a fee like some stations do. Car wash around back, although I've never used it, it's always busy.  Staff is always pleasant and efficient. Okay selection of snack and drink but not the best.
5	It seems a bit unusual that someone would feel the need to review a gas station. Gas is gas, right? Not necessarily. A few reasons why this Arco is my favorite place to get gas:1. Price per gallon is the same regardless of payment method. A recent gas station phenomenon is that gas stations only give the lower price to cash payers and the price for credit/debit payers is approximately 10 cents more. That isn't the case here.2. Credit cards are accepted. One reason Arco usually has the lowest gas prices is because most only accept cash or debit, thus the station doesn't have to incur credit card transaction fees. This Arco does accept credit cards, yet still maintains the low prices associated with most Arco stations.3. No transaction fee is applied when paying with credit cards. I've never paid with a debit card, but when paying by credit card, I'm not charged the usual 35 cent transaction fee.
