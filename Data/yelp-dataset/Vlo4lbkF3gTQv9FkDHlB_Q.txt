4	Is this the best pizza in the world?  No.  But for $5.00 for a medium (14") cheese pizza, and $1.00 per topping, I'll take it!!I don't know if this is "true" New York pizza, but it's certainly a departure from the national chains.  Not thick crust, but not crispy thin either, and just the right amount of good sauce.  I personally would like a bit more cheese - but my friends think it's perfect just as is.  The sausage and pepperoni are better than what I've had on other pies delivered locally.This pizza is great fresh and hot, but is just as good two hours later when there's a break in the action in the Friday night poker game.  The perfect food for weekends!The menu says they offer wings and chicken fingers too - maybe someday we'll branch out from a stack of pizzas on a Friday night.  The specialty pizzas, calzones and strombolis sound incredible.  Here's hoping this little pizza joint at Serene & Tamarus sticks around - they've already dropped their prices in the two months they've been open (the menu with my pizzas tonight had new prices.)
3	The Pizza at Steve-O's is pretty good, and the price is a great value in the world of Pizza shops.  Right next to my old High School Steve-O's is slowly making it way... The store unfortunately still needs to have some work done on the inside, but hey, we want Pizza right? If your in the area and craving a slice, give Steve-O's a shot.
