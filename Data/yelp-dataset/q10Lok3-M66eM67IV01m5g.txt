5	Smith's Deli is very close to our new flat, and I have to say we were very grateful to have Smith's just round the corner when we were doing the flat up and has no kitchen.  They sell lovely soup, normally lentil and another 'special' soup and of course numerous different sandwich fillings. They also sell bacon rolls, which I am told are excellent. My other half has one at least once a week, and we bought them for some friends who came to stay. They definitely enjoyed them.If you are in the area and need some breakfast or lunch I would definitely recommend Smith's.

We moved in close to Smith's a couple of weeks ago, and it's been great - they made me a batch of much-needed coffees on our moving day, despite being in the middle of closing up, and we had delicious sandwiches the following day when our kitchen was too much of a muddle to cook. I'll definitely keep going there, it's a great wee place to have on your doorstep.
