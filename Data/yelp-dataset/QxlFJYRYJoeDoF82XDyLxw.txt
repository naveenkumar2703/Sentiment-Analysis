2	'Emily, you HAVE to go to Ping on, it's like, amazing, yah yah yah' were the words I heard walking a rather tiddly and posh friend back home to Stockbridge the other night. I had heard about it, as it is open very late and feeds the drunk 2am market. What's not to like?Well, I made the mistake of eating here sober. Don't get me wrong - it was edible, but only just. I had crispy beef and my friend had sweet and sour chicken, but they both tasted exactly the same. The rice was really cold too, which I'm always wary of following a less-than-pleasant experience in Tenerife with bad rice.The shop itself is quite cool in it's own way...maybe unintentionally so but cool nevertheless. I think that going here after a night out is the best way to experience PingOn, inebriating the senses.
3	PingOn's only saving grace is that it's open till the wee hours of the morning. It was my saving grace last winter when it was minus 15. The staff have no problem with you nursing a cup of tea for 2 hours.On the food side of things, not good. This place is practically a take away with a seating area and table service. My the veg in my chow mein tasted a little old and the noodles were a little rubbery.
4	Ping on opens late, and I mean late. It also delivers to Morningside so I am instantly a fan! We had a large order including crispy duck, squid, chinese greens, soups rice and the whole shebang. I cant comment on the restaurant having only had a takeout but that was tasty and fresh, and not gloopy and MSG-ified in that nasty cheap take out way. Try it!
3	Pleasant, good service, and reasonably priced. Enjoyed the shrimp chow mein (soft noodles).
3	This is decent, solid Chinese food. Nothing fancy, nothing to get too excited about, but a place we wouldn't mind eating at again. The food was tasty enough. The decor and drinks selection at the restaurant are nothing special, so I think we're more likely to get this as take-out next time around.
