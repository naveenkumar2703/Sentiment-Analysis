3	Decent local course for sure.  Nice facility and course layout.  Be sure to check the local papers cause this place ALWAYS has 2 for 1 greens fees coupons.  One of the longer courses in Sun City West, so play can be a little on the slow side depending on the group in front of you.
3	Typical retirement course. The greens were in good shape. Had some challenging holes which was nice. A good value for Phoenix in the middle of winter when golf prices are outragous.
4	Great course for the price. Employees are friendly. The greens were in good shape as well as the fairways. Something goofy going on in the rough but it was heading into off season so no big deal.
1	Eek - If you are considering getting married here I would bring in your own Wedding Planner who is a Professional ! The lady running this is extremely rude and does not work well with families or vendors !   USually when you are a planner at a venue you solve problems and dont just shrug you shoulders and ay oh well ! -
