2	Visited several times here during our stay at THEhotel for coffee, snacks, etc. and every time the servers at the register had a look of indifference. Service was what it was...a dud. They didn't smile, and they weren't rude, but I find a smile goes a long way these days.The pastries at this particular location were just OK and the cupcakes were borderline bad and I'm certain they weren't fresh.  The only item worth going back for was the little mozzarella tomato salad.  The tomatoes were suprisingly fresh, the mozzarella was as well, and the pesto dressing was delicious. If a caprese snack wasn't what you were looking for, then keep walking into Mandalay Bay.  It's worth it.

I had only planned on getting a coffee here but then we noticed the bacon cheddar scone and I had to try it.  It was good with bacon, scallion and cheddar flavors but also a slight sweetness to it.  My coffee was also good, much better than any starbucks I have had.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here in the future.  I enjoyed both my coffee and the scone and I imagine it would be a great place to head with a hangover with the dim lighting!
