5	Love Mulligan's! Food is great! Nice escape for a quiet lunch meeting! Very peaceful eating at a golf course in a casual setting!
5	Came here for breakfast and the food was great. I had bacon, eggs, hash browns, and toast for only $5. The bacon was excellent quality and everything was cooked to perfection. I'll be back again!
5	I think this place has very good burgers and fries and will have to leave it at that as I never tried anything else. Seriously the burgers are better than going to the place up the street that specializes in burgers. The owner is serious but has a friendly under current.  The big guy reminds me of the larger guy in the Penn & Teller duo but I have found him to be OK moody.  On the 8th tee there is a sign inviting you to call in your food order to be picked up on the turn.  The other day I played golf and we called from the 8th fairway to place an order got a answering machine. I tried again on the 9th tee and a girl answered and said she was too busy to take an order.  We stopped in after the 9th and there was no one in the restaurant so we waited for a her to make a couple of hot dogs which she butterflied to give them the special touch. This was around 12:40 and I don't think she should be left alone during the midday lunch period.  I can only think the owner had to run an errand so this experience will not change my loyalty to this business.   It is good food at reasonable prices so I recommend it and will look forward to lunch when I golf Encanto.
