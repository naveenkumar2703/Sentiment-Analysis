4	I am such a fan of Lucy.  I'm a bigger fan of Lucy at Kierland Commons in Scottsdale, which is a bummer because this one is closer to my new home in Chandler.  The store itself has a weird layout, in part because of the two entrances I think?  And the saleswoman I encountered (not the preggo one) was a little too eager for my taste.  She was really, really enthusiastic.  I did finally let her help me, and she was helpful.....but still.  Anyway, Lucy has great active wear for the avid runner (like myself) and your every day yoga gal.  Plus, if you give them your address you will get discounts from time to time!
5	I just am in love with this store! Associates are awesome and their sportswear is the best there is out there!I always love to pick thru their great markdowns, because it Is somewhat pricey.although you do get what you pay for....and quality lasts!
5	Great  workout clothes for almost EVERY size. I'm a bigger sized woman and they had my size! I'm not shy about asking for the extra large, as it is obvious, so I was happy I could wear many many things here. If you are 18/20 or 22/24 you can fit in to many things here. So no worries! Otherwise a majority of the clothes are made for a slimmer frame.The work out clothes have the 'wicking' fabric but in many styles and all are made with comfort in mind. I am wearing some now. lol.  Great for running, yoga, etc...  The woman who helped me at first was SO over the top it was ridiculous but she was very nice. The young woman who cashed me out was just a lovely sweet person.They were very helpful and I was very very pleased with my purchases.The sale items were great and a really good deal.  TLDR: The store to go to for comfort quality workout clothes. Over average price but not when you when you total the comfort, style, and quality of the product. These clothes will last.  There are great sales! All the clothes feel like the person making them knew what a woman's wants and the shape of a woman.
