5	Took my bike in to be tuned.  Looked brand new when I picked up, earlier than promised time.  Highly recommend.
2	Website states that Pebbe Creek residents can get pick up and delivery on bikes dr service.. I stopped in today to set it up,  I was told by the individualThey no longer do that but haven't  updated their site. Also said not open on Sunday. Very unpersonable and  indifferent to customer.  I will be posting this comment on the pebble creek website also.  There are approx 4000 homes in the area.  They need to update their website so people do not make a wasted trip.  Also Abe a little more customer friendly might be helpful.
1	Not so ultimate as I thought. Very small selection and no greeting or offer of assistance as a friend and I browsed through the store.
5	These guys have gone above and beyond to help me get my bike ready to ride. They truly seem to care more about the sport then just making money.
