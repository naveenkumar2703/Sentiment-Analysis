5	one stop shop for all things shipping, many other services available but I only needed to send something. Service was fast and helpful and when I called in because like a do do I lost my tracking info, Mike was able to pull up asap and even tracked it for me! You rly cant beat that,will be back for my holiday shipping.
1	Dismissively unhelpful. I popped in to grab a birthday card and couldn't find the corresponding envelope. When I asked the girl that was working if she had any more, I was told that they were mixed up, but on the rack (they were not). She never made any attempt to help me look or even bothered to look at me while she spoke. I replied, "So that's it?" and received no response. As I stood there flabbergasted, the gentleman working the counter walked over, silently pulled out a box of miscellaneous envelopes, placed them on the counter, and walked away without acknowledgement.
5	Love this place, have a box here for a couple years now and the staff has always delivered all my mail. Never once did I lose something (and I do a LOT of amazon shopping).  Mike is the owner, Tesa and Bill work there helping, all of them are friendly and helpful. Recommend them for mailbox rental!
2	A little disappointed about the service. They used to be more friendly.I have been a customer for over 10 years. They have changed owners several times I believe. It's just not the same anymore. My mail I get fine. What I am trying to say is ...I just miss the personal interaction with the people that work there. They used to know us by name.
