5	I recommend the Goodman Fitness Center to anyone who would love a place to work out, but may not use it enough to warrant an expensive gym membership at a club.  I have wasted so much money on gyms that I had to pay for when I was injured or sick, or when it was beautiful and sunny out and I got my exercise outside instead.   Goodman has everything I need (minus a pool on this side of town), and I can pay per workout or pay for a punch card that is only punched when I actually use the facility.  It is the way gyms ought to be!  Now I can bike outdoors when it's nice and workout indoors when I feel like it and not be financially penalized for it.  It's kept very clean and well supplied too.
5	Went here for the Mad City Vegan Fest.  Good space for it.  My toddler liked the playground, which is available for public use outside of daycare hours.  The festival was great too.  Love all the samples!
5	Can't say much about their gym/pool facilities or their programming for kids, but what I DO know... is they're a great event venue. I've been to several now, a birthday party, a bar mitzvah, Mad City Vegan Fest, and every one of them was superbly organized. I realize much of this can be due in part to the people producing these events, but for everything to run so seamless really does speak to the staff that Goodman employs to set up rooms and run events. I'm not certain what costs are like, but consider them in your planning. They have a unique space that's different than other traditional spots in Madison.
4	I enjoyed being here, and enjoyed the food at our reception. What a neat building, and to be scattered with art!  It felt kind of steampunk, they should play that up, retrofitting everything in old leather, iron, and, I don't know, binocular googles?And the playground was exceptional as well.
