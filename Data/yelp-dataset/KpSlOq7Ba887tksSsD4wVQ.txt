1	All I can say is that they quoted us a price of $765.00 for the replacement of two battery cables and a new battery. You take it from there. Wish they had a rating of  minus cause thats where I would put them.
5	I wont go anywhere else to get my car fixed. Ask for John when you go here. He was very courteous and friendly from the get go. He went out of his way to let me know in detail what he was going to do and how he was going to do it. He probably didn't need to since i'm not too smart in the car area.
5	They do great work, and their customer service was excellent.  I saved a lot of money and the I was very happy with the way that John and Rob communicated with me throughout the whole job.  Family owned and operated for 2 generations already, give them a try before you waste your money at the dealership... you wont regret it!

5	I went to the Honda stealership then came here. Car was fixed on time and I saved 40% !!! Thanks John and Rob, the wife will be happy with the car now. Runs like new again. Don't be deceived with the area, the shop does quality work."
5	Great and fast service. Most affordable shop I've come across in Phoenix/Glendale. Will continue to come here for regular maintenance!
