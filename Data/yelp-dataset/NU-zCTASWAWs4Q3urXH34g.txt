4	This was really, really good Lao-Thai food, except heavy on the onions.  I had the red curry squash, which was SO much better than when I had it on State Street.  The restaurant was pretty quiet when we were there, but that meant the server was extra attentive and friendly.   The restaurant owner's teens were also setting up to have a Lao dance party there after closing time, and they invited us to come back to dance!  It was very cute. I kinda wish we had gone back to party with them.
4	I'll admit I've never eaten here (take-out only). Reason: The atmosphere is lacking (see other reviews).However, the food is great. Granted the only thing I've had here is the Pad Thai (the BEST!!!) and the spring roll. I would check this place out if only for the Pad Thai (carry-out recommended).
3	The atmosphere is awful. But the food is excellent. I'm a creature of habit, so it's Pad Thai for me. It will always be one of the best Pad Thai dishes I've had anywhere.Word to the wise: It can sometimes be VERY spicy, even if you request it to be mild. VERY spicy, people.
1	The food was oddly bland, and the servers took forever to take our order (i think the person i went with never even got her drink).
1	yuck.  I love eating.  I love food.  Not finishing my plate is a rare event.  My red curry was almost all cheap, hardly cooked onions.  The sauce did not taste like curry, and they had Chinese zodiac menus on the table.  I can accept many flaws, but there was not a single redeemable quality here.
1	One question: how do places like this stay in business?  My son had the "beef curry," which was a plate of onions and a few bits of cow gristle.  My pad Thai was soupy and bland, like watery EasyMac.  So-so service, airport-waiting area ambiance... need I say more? Yuck!
