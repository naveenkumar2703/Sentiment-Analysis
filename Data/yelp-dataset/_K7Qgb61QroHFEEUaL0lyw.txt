3	A nice computer game shop to visit if you are in Edinburgh. The store is small to medium sized and the staff there are very helpful and friendly. They do sell some good deals at times, depending on the season I guess and they stock the latest games and consoles like PC's to Xboxes. The store design inside is clean and tidy, they could do with some more staff working on the shop floor but overall the product range is very large. You can pre-order items here and pick it up without any hassle. Definitely a nice place to get some computer games from.
4	I popped in here the other day with my friend who was looking to purchase to new Pokemon game for the DS. As soon as we walked in I was surprised at how bright and fresh this branch of Game is. Usually branches of Game are fustier than a tramps undercrackers but this one was crisp, clean and organised. I get the impression that the managers and staff here are completely on the ball and much more customer friendly than their counterparts in other stores. We were even approached by a guy working here who was super friendly and asked us if we needed any help - something I've never experienced in any other Game shop where you usually just get looked at like an imbecile if you ask any kind of question.This is a pretty large branch, they have a great selection of games and a lot of pre-owned ones at reasonable prices. There was a titanic mystery game that caught my eye but I also noticed possibly the worst game ever made, an OK! DS game that is essentially just an electronic version of the shittest magazine ever. Why?
