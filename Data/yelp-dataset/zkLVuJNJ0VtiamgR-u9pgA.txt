1	One star for doing your best to make the parking situation at Camelback Mountain as aggravating as possible.  One star for pandering to your idiot residents that didn't realize that they live in the middle of a giant metropolis which means there might be traffic. If they wanted peace and quiet they should have moved to Montana. One star for paying your police officers to drive around all day long looking for hikers that park in front of someone's house.
5	One of my favorite towns in the Valley.  We have a few friends who live here and frequently visit the resorts and restaurants.Things I like:+ Camelback Mountain+ All homes must be on an acre or more of land.+ High standard of living required for all residents.+ Residents stand by their convictions and don't waver.+ Awesome resorts and restaurants.  The Sanctuary Resort and El Chorro Lodge are 2 of my favs in PV.Things I don't like:- 40 mph speed limit on major streets cutting through.- Traffic cameras are everywhere, boo!- Very few street lights.  It's extremely dark driving around Paradise Valley.  You could miss a street or destination if you're unfamiliar with the area.- All of the hikers who invade the town to hike Camelback and ignore the local laws and rules.  Then act disrespectful when they are cited.Overall, I'd love to live here someday.Return Factor - 100%
