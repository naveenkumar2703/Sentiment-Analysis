2	Food is pretty good for bar-type selections. Prices are competitive with most "franchise" restaurants/bars. They have karaoke, BuzzTime trivia, pool tables and some video games. Place offers live music on Friday and Saturday nights. Most days/nights plan to sit at the bar. Table service is very much lacking beyond that distance. This also happened during the 2006 NFL season. I don't know what it's like this year; haven't been back for football since. Overall it's a nice neighborhood bar.

1	Ewwwww, this place is gross. Kinda smells like a urine trough without the blue smell good thingy.
