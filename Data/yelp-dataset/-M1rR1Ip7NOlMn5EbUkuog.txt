2	Gas station McDonalds!  Well they keep it fairly clean inside, and there's minimal seating, and the drive-thru moves fairly quickly.  Plus you can get gas while you're there.  Had a couple errors on my orders but they're fast at breakfast time.
4	This is the closest McDonald's to my house.  I like to hit it up for breakfast every once in a while.  I also get dessert here when I have a sweet tooth.  I have never had a problem here.  The staff is always friendly.  Even though it is in a gas station it is really nice for a McDonald's.
1	There are a few reasons why I never go to McDonalds.  1--bad food.  2.--which I just experienced, is an incompetent work force. Unfortunately I live right by this one.   I drove through and ordered a Large Diet Coke.  So I order, I'm told $1.09, pull ahead, blah blah blah.  Anyways, i'm sitting behind the car in front of me for literally 8 minutes.  Now i'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure Mcdonalds has a company policy where large orders that take this amount of time are required to "pull around" and wait to have their food brought to them, to allow small orders, like my Large Diet Coke which takes 13 seconds to fill, "fast food" service.   Well, not so much.   So 8 minutes go by, i'm waiting, i'm waiting, i'm waiting (and there's nowhere to exit at this location), finally I pull up to the window.  Hand the lady my card she runs it, hands me my card, receipt and I realize i've been charged $9.00+.  SO i Say this isn't my order, blah blah blah, and she gets the manager.  Manger yells at the employee, explains proper procedure (which is another time consuming task), all the while i'm sitting here and I just want my fucking Diet Coke and card refunded.  So now i'm dealing with the manager.  Literally took her 2 minutes of constant swiping of my debit card to get it refunded.   She hands me my drink, then she hands me the receipt.   Two of them, first showing i've been refunded, and then she says "the second one is for the drink.", and then she says, "I'm sorry about the wait."I told her if she was really sorry I wouldn't' have been charged for the drink.  Are you serious?  I just waited in line for 14 minutes for a large fountain drink and you, the manager, the person in charge, don't even have the common sense or courtesy to give me the drink for free?  Are you serious?  Complete and utter incompetence and completely unaware of what the term customer service means. I'm not pissed about being charged $1.  I'm pissed that my time was wasted.
3	I will occasionally stop here for breakfast.  When I do, I order 2 Sausage McMuffins w/no Egg, 1 Hash Browns, $3.27.  The drive thru lane can get slow and jammed up....there's not much room for more than 2 or 3 cars to be in line at the ordering speaker before it starts getting messy.One convenient aspect of this location is that there's a gas station attached to it.Return Factor - 50%
4	The employees are all exceptionally friendly and appear to appreciate my business. It's very nice to be treated so well. The food is normally fresh but the egg white delight sometimes has a crunchy English muffin that seems a little older. This isn't all the time though. Overall I have had great experiences there.
1	******** Apparently Seniors Are NOT Welcomed at ANY Of Their Locations ********I stop at McDonalds  perhaps three times a year.I don't like McDonalds food.                     ********* The Coffee is Another Story *********I have no qualms with it.In the past ..... I order a "Senior Coffee" ...... and leave.        ********** McDonalds is GREEDY **********They NO LONGER offer a Senior Coffee.
1	It can't believe the manager here Sara Morris smokes and sells marijuana to co workers and has sex with them in the parking lot. The public should know that this diseased woman handles your food and works at a place that thinks this is ok. Edgar a former employee can tell you all about it.
