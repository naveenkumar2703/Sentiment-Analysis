3	I have gone to this store for different reasons, but it's generally been to get a new phone.  Since I am now an iPhone user, this store is less relevant.  I came to get a SIMM card to use in a modem for 3G internet access when away from home.It seems like no one at AT*&T knows anything about prepaid wireless.  That includes the store and the 800 support number.  The people that work here have always been helpful as they were today, but they can't give me advice about something for which they've never been trained.
5	Whenever i have to deal with a live person from ATT and want to receive good customer service, I happily drive all the way out here. The staff seem to know what they're doing and are very helpful with answering questions.Came here to get a sim card for the newly bought iPhone my bf got me. Apple conveniently ran out of sim cards so we ended up here. Anyway, five stars because the guy behind the counter was extremely nice and knowledgeable about their products and services. He thoroughly explained each data plan and why it was important to choose the right one.  He even gave me a discount for the bumper since they only had one left and there were no other colors for me to choose from.
1	Went to ask a question about my new IPhone.  There was a customer ahead of me so i was asked to wait.  No problem...Then while waiting on me, another customer comes in the door. He however is asked what is the problem and the clerk starts to help him while I'm sitting there.  Clerk now says he can wait on two people at once.  Now I have half his attention at best, because he is reaching to make a phone call for the other guy.No respect!  Maybe it's a senior citizen thing.  I no longer recommend this place.  I walked out of the store, I haven't done that in a LONG time.
