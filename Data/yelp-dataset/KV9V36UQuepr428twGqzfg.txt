5	I know Sue personally, and she is amazing with pets.  If she lived here in the Old Town Scottsdale area, she would definitely be my pet sitter.  Our pet care business doesn't travel north of Shea.  We receive many calls every single week from pet owners who live north of our service area.  I happily refer all of them to Sue and her staff.Too many people don't truly understand what it takes to be a professional pet sitter or dog walker.  We aren't random people found on Craigslist trying to make extra money or steal your things.  We are true professionals who are licensed, bonded, insured and most importantly, certified.  All pet owners should be registered with a quality professional.  I highly recommend Sue.  Go ahead, give her a call.
5	I have to say, the stress of traveling for work or leaving on vacation is all but gone because of Sue. I have a crazy cat that needs to be walked and she didn't blink an eye at his needs. She is not only great with my animals she is truly professional about everything she does from looking after the plants to having emergency plans in place should something go wrong around the house.I highly recommend Sue for all your pet and house sitting needs. Thanks Sue!Kim A
5	I came across Sue when in a bind about two years ago. I had a sick cat and was about to leave for a business trip and was concerned about leaving the cat in a kennel while I had our other cat at home. I found Sue's website and called and Sue made time to meet me on short notice. What a life saver. She helped with the sick cat and checked on our other cat. Everything went smoothly and she even kept us updated via text message. Since that time, we have use Sue on numerous occasions and I can't say enough good things about her service. Not only does one get the comfort of knowing their pets are safely cared for, but you also have someone you trust to keep an eye on your home while away. Thank you, Sue. We appreciate the help. http://furfriendlypetsitting.co/
