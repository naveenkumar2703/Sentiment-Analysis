5	Great little shop. Its good to know that some people still believe in quality over quantity. Rob takes his time making sure that whatever work he does to your car comes out looking great. I had HID bulbs and an underbody neon kit installed oin my car and it looks amazing. This shop is worth the drive
5	Love this place, Rob is up front with you and is very very reasonable, he fixed my 01 acura CL HId headlight when the ballast went bad everyone wanted over 500 bucks to fix I bought the ballast and he fabricated the headlight to work for me for 75 bucks,he was a savior for me and I reccommend everyone to go there!!
5	Great place for great customer service and excellent products knowledge and installs completed professionally
5	Staff was friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and not pushy. I was extremely pleased with my experience there, highly recommended!
1	The other reviews cover auto part installation which may be their speciality.  But I used them to install an Interlock device through Instant Interlock. They damaged my ignition and would not remove the device when it was due. They delayed removal until I was charged late fees even though they were not monitoring the device. They denied the damage but would not even look at the device or vehicle. Just said it was "not possible" although my 2 mechanics disagreed. As a result, I have had to spend hundreds of dollars in illegally charged  fees from Instant Interlock. Not to mention the cost of repairing my vehicle which is yet to be determined. Much of the rude, disrespectful and dishonest behavior was on the part of Instant Interlock, but the problems with the device itself and the installation were caused by Streetfighter's. And they lied to us about removing it, didn't show as promised and lied about the fees.DON'T let these guys installl an interlock on your car. And don't use Instant Interlock either.
