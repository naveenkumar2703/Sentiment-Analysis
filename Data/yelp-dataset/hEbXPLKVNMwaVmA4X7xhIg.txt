5	Ugly Cakes Bakery's sweet treats are to die for.  I am a sucker for sweets...but not just any sweets.  I know what's good and what isn't.  The minute I tried the Carrot Cake I thought I died and went to heaven.  But it didn't end there.  Then I tried some cookies...and then some fudge...and 'tis the season for Pumpkin Rolls!!! I wanted to cry when I ran out.  Seriously -- not only are the treats amazing and baked with some major TLC, the souls behind the company are treasures themselves.  Awesome branding, awesome concepts, awesome food, awesome people.  Highly recommend them to anyone -- even if you dont think you like sweets, you'll like theirs.  I promise!!!!!!
5	Phenomenal cakes by a baker as sweet as her desserts! The BEST Carrot Cake and German Chocolate Cake I have EVER had! The cake stays very moist even days after being in the refrigerator. The Carrot Cake is heavenly and the German Chocolate is perfection (not too rich like most German Chocolate Cakes can be). I can't rave enough about Ugly Cakes! I won't go anywhere else for my celebration treats.
5	I reached out to Ugly Cakes looking for a low sugar cupcake for my son's first birthday. Cindy and her daughter were extremely responsive, answering all of my questions and working with me to decide on the perfect cupcakes. The cupcakes were a hit! The low sugar ones were delicious, and the texture was great. I wish we lived closer so we could sample all of their sweets!Thanks Cindy!
