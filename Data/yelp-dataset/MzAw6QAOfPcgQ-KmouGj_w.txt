5	They did a huge over-hall on my pool electrical system.  Installed state of the art equipment...as well as many other upgrades.  We found them to be professional, on time and honest.  Highly recommend.
1	After two times out to fix a pool pump leak they were suppose to replace the housing on the third visit.  On the third visit they sent a new employee with no knowledge of the prior visits or problem. He did not have the housing part and tried to sell me a new pump. BEWARE. THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE THE $80 SERVICE CHARGE WHEN U MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.   Bottom line.  3 visits and $347 later I still have my leak. POOR SERVICE AND CHARGES ARE HIGH.
4	After an unsuccessful long year with many pool repair companies, we called Rogers Repair Service and they got our pool / spa heater working. Roger came out and repaired our old pool system and I was very happy with his work. Will be sticking to Roger's Repair for future repair needs.
