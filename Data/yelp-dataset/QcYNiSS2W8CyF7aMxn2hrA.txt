1	Hey guys, stop getting all businesses. Groceries have to be fresh and there have to be helpers but noooo, not with Wal Mart. We have the money so put up a store so we can put all other stores out of business.Do what you are best at not do everything and everything poorly.
4	The Neighborhood markets are a blessing in disguise. Nah Myo Renge kyo. Its smaller the aisles are spaced out and well stocked. And The prices are cheaper compared to other grocery stores. I love the Neighborhood market. Especially when they sell the hot chickens late at night for 1.00 and they keep well in the freezer. They do tend to shy away from cashiers and have more self checkouts which can be a pain unless it spits out more money then what you put in. Which has happened to me and is awesome. LOL
4	I have to say I haven't had any issues in this Wal-Mart. Just don't like the feel of it. Of course the prices are fair but it is Wal-Mart.
2	The lines are always extremely long and no one is willing to help you too much. Typical cheap prices you'll find at a Walmart but if there was anything other option I would go elsewhere.
