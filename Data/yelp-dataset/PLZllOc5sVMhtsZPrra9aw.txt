1	this place is a mess.  people were yelling in the kitchen and not cooking food. the drive thru was backed up with no food going out.  I asked where the manager was and was told she was in the back yelling and not working along with the rest of the help . the only one working was Haley.  I asked her what her name was. the garage cans were overflowing and it wasn't clean.
1	Only come here if you have time to kill. I've been here three times...and twice I finally walked out (along with a few other people who gave up as well). They're extremely slow and don't really care how long it takes them to get around to your order. It isn't an issue with the number of employees, either, because there's usually five to six employees hanging around waiting for someone else to do their job. While I was watching the (very slow) guy in the back putting the burgers together, the woman up front was staring into space. Apparently, there's some Burger King law that says you have to wait until you have the hamburger on the tray before you can scoop out the fries and onion rings. Absolutely ridiculous. I get faster service at a sit-down restaurant.
4	Nothing but positive for this bk. It is fast food so I can't give it a 5, but I usually typically come late at night. They haven't messed my order up once surprisingly in 5+years. Sometimes the order might take awhile but it's to make it fresh. I love the new big Mac knock off, but my favorite is the crispy chicken salad with Ranch then asking for Buffalo sauce
2	When we got home and opened the bag the size of the BIG KING sandwich's were so small we started laughing. I ordered a large fries and got less than half of what I expected. TOTAL RIP OFF!!!How do you get rid of 40% fat and 30% calories? CUT THE SERVING SIZE IN HALF!!!
