1	right when i walked in, i found that they did not do much with decorating the place or at least try to cover all those typical shopping center windows.  The bar area was mediocre and did not have enough room for more than 6 people.  i was impressed that they did have nigori or "unfiltered" sake, which is so good and sweet when drank cold.   The teppanyaki area also was decorated poorly.  Our chef was very entertaining (chopping, smacking, lighting things on fire,cracking eggs,etc right before our eyes), but the Geisha Special was so unimpressive.  The tempura was tempura.  The chicken yakitori was chicken with a sweet glaze.  The fried rice was fried rice.  I had filet mignon, chicken, and lobster cooked in teriyaki sauce, but the flavor was nothing new to me.  The only great thing about this place is the company i was with, the unfiltered sake, and the chef that cooks in front of you.  don't get me wrong, but I really love japanese food.  I'd have to say that I probably would've enjoyed the meal more if i was drunk off my ass w/sake and somebody delivered food to me from the fast food japanese joint at the local mall.  I would give it 1 and 1/2 star, but I can't so I'm giving it a one star.
5	My family and I went here for my Mother's 70th birthday celebration dinner.  I actually wanted to take her to a very reputable Steakhouse but she insisted on dining here since it's been her favorite place for special occassions. They have two locations... the one near the strip has been around since the 1980's I believe and has been a local and non-local favorite spot for many. I would suggest to make a reservation since this location is a local spot,  you may have to wait if you don't... Better safe than sorry.There is a bar separate from two main dining rooms. One for Teppanyaki ( the decor is simple yet pleasant to look at, the lighting is dim... just the way I like it! ) and the other a more hip trendy lit area that gives off a L.A. joint vibe. I never been to a Teppanyaki place here in Vegas that played some really good beats... hip hop Hooray for me =) It really put me in a happy, want to sing along mood to every song. Hey DJ you ARE playing all my songs!!! Even my family was jammin to the beats.Our Chef was entertaining and got us to interact with him from catching food in our mouth wow never knew my family is soo talented, to scare the living Sh** out of me from putting sauce on my face BUT it was fake... He even talked to us and carried a decent conversation while cookin up a storm for us... skills... MAD skills I tell ya.We all ordered the Geisha Special which is Lobster, Chicken, Filet Mignon, Shrimp with fried rice and tempura. Also comes with salad that was refreshingly crisp and tasty. The soup broth with bits of mushroom slices had a burst of flavor even though it looked oh so simple. The tempura was lightly deep fried to perfection and enjoyed each crisp bite of hotness.The fried rice was colorful and delicious... I admired the texture of the rice which made it very enjoyable. The Lobster meat was juicy and plumped... Filet was chunky and tender... Chicken was plentiful and all the meats were cooked in no sauce but only seasoning that made it absolutely delicious and satisfying. They have their own house special dipping sauce on the side for the meats but in reference to cooking with Teriyaki Sauce?!?! LOL You gotta be kiddin me... I know what that tastes like and there's no Teriyaki Bowl Teppanyaki here. Overall my Mother had a great birthday dinner... happy with Sake, food and service was memorable, alcohol beverages were made strong * Good Job!! not watered down like some places, had tons of leftovers, which I was sooo excited to wake up for the next day, and now understand why my Mother loves this place so much. Go there BUT come hungry!!!
4	Shabu shabu, aka hot pot, aka Asian fondue, has returned to S. Fort Apache Road!The Geisha Corporation has opened up their fourth restaurant with the name of "Little Geisha Shabu Shabu."  Taking over this huge space once owned by Nina's, Little Geisha offers hot pot, sukiyaki, and something called Genghis Khan shabu shabu.For $13.95, you can have the Prime Rib Eye Shabu Shabu, which also comes with a platter of veggies including udon noodles.  Two dipping sauces accompany this dinner, the first being a ponzu and the other possibly being of a sesame variety.  After cooking your meat and veggies in the hot broth, dip your food into both sauces before consuming.  Its all the flavor you'll ever want!  For $14.95, you can have the Prime Rib Eye Sukiyaki dinner, which also comes with a platter of veggies, udon noodles, and a raw egg.  Their sukiyaki sauce has quite a bit of flavor and the BF was impressed with their concoction.  They pour this stuff into a hot pan and start cooking your food in this sauce.  All dinners come with a bowl of rice and a couple of side dishes of kim chee and pickled goodies.  Be sure to add the garlic, radish, and green onions to your shabu shabu or sukiyaki, it adds a lot more flavor overall.Feel free to ask for more rice, kim chee, and pickled stuff since there's no additional charge for it.  (Double check though!)  The BF and I left pretty full, and it appears they offer a bit more veggies than Swish does.Business is still slow at this location since there's not too much traffic yet around here.  We were the only ones there at 7 pm, but by the time we left, three other parties had joined us.  Employees were helpful in cooking practically all our food for us, and I wasn't sure if this was standard practice or because they were so slow.  (I can't imagine how they could cook everyone's stuff for them if they were packed.)  It can feel a bit rushed when they do all the cooking for you, so feel free to tell them you can take over at any time.  It can get messy with them picking out all your food for you, but depending on your chopsticks skill, maybe you do want them to do it for you.They also offer plenty of tables for those not interested in cooking up their own food.  It's a pretty small and straightforward menu at Little Geisha.  Let's see if they can last longer than Nina's did!
5	If you're looking for great tepan than this is the place. Everything is delicious and the chef's are entertaining.  Great place for anniversary's.  Among my favorites were the filet mignon and the egg rolls. The service was exceptional and the owner is brilliant!!!! Way to go Geisha!!!
5	Wow, I don't know about the other reviews but this place was awesome. There were two cooks on a Monday night and the soup and salad were good while we waited, which wasn't long. I don't remember our cooks name but he's from Columbia and he was great! He had personality and he had charm and a little pizazz to the presentation. Me and the bf each had cocktails and Yakitori. I ordered the Filet Mignon and he had the NY steak. The rice was great, the meat... each little piece was a pice of heaven. Originally the cook gave us two sauces but during our conversaion he gave us a third very very spicy sauce which to say at this moment as i'm Yelpin. well the spice danced on my tongue and laughed at me as i gulped down water. But i loved it. And now..i could some milk :)The place is kinda of small and can see that if they were busy how it might taint the experience. So go on a monday~ Also the decor wasn't bad either with the dark wooden art pieces, dark framed mirrors and big red hanging ball lights.Bottom line :  Small, good and unique.
5	i've been to all kinds of hibachi places but geisha house is what's up.get the geisha house special!order the flavored sake, mango or watermelonit's a little bit extra but it tastes like HEAVEN!!!i'm already craving the pink garlic ginger they put in the fried rice.
1	I have tried to go to this restaurant three times. The first time it was closed for whatever reason. The second time we had called to see what time they were opening for lunch and the employee rudely told us they wouldn't be open until dinner. The third time they were closed for "renovations" (probably health code violations).Three strikes you're out...Go to Swish on Spring Mountain instead...they ARE OPEN.
5	Love Geisha House, always make sure to stop by when I'm in town. Similar to Benihana, but better. Great food, generous portions. Staff is friendly and attentive, prices are reasonable. Their rice is unreal, usually order double when I go in. Definitely stop in if you're looking for a hearty meal at a nice price in Las Vegas.
1	Went to naked fish happy hour. Really bad bad service and they charge mandatory $5 gratuity. Not worth the food. Never will go back. And bad service and had to pay the tips.
1	Reflecting back on my visit here a few months ago, with a unbiased neutral mind, my experience here was been THE worst of my life. Went in on a Friday night with a group of 5 after seeing an advertised special of 14.99 all you can eat sushi. When we got there, it was fairly empty but we weren't seated for about 15 minutes, for no given reason at all. After being seated, we sat for another 10 minutes after our waitress disappeared, without any notice or even leaving of any menus at all. When she came back to fianlly take our drink orders, she told us that the tiny piece of paper in the plastic display was the menu. It was then we foud out that the special 14.99 menu was limited to about 6-7 different items from the very basic nigiri (salmon, tuna, shrimp) to a few plain, unoriginal rolls (California, phill, spicy tuna). No appetizers, no included drinks, just those. Dissatisfied and irritated already, I asked to see a regular menu becuase I wasn't feeeling for any of those, she snarled and said "no a.y.c.e. on the full menu, you have to pay full price." I didn't ask for the prices, I asked for the menu. Her farfetched assumption that we were cheap was very insulting. We shouldve left then, but we didn't. There was a selection of happy hour cocktails and mixed drinks that we ordered some of which never arrived at all. Some chose to order off the regular menu, some chose the AYCE and one, so turned off by the way things were going simply didn't want to eat anything. The food came out extremely slowly for the AYCE, often all on one big plate, left for us to divide them across the table in confusion. The sushi was very very mediocre, need I say I've had some better prepackaged supermarket brands. Nigiri had too much rice, sushi rice being too cold and lacking vinegar and the fish being hardly fresh. The rolls were not bad nor great, just.. Boring. During the entire time our party was dining, we didn't recieve one polite gesture from the waitress, or even the bussers.The tipping point of the whole night was at the end. After asking for the bill, which was a difficult task simply because we could barely get a hold of our server, she delivered it and vanished once more. Ahh, the problems arose. We were grossly overcharged. She charged us for 6 AYCE's and all the cocktails we ordered were full price. When we asked her about it, she claimed that the non-ayce patrons ate fron the ayce's plate. That was not the case, trust me, I hardly doubt they were dying to sneak a bite of a California roll. She insisted that was the case and even started to argue. Also when asked about the drinks, she said that we ordered them after the happy hour time, when in reality the fact that we got our drinks 30 minutes after we ordered them due to the entire staffs negligence was probably why she thought we ordered them late. Also and the kicker? There was a crazy, "$5 service charge" added to every single AYCE dinner patron, which brought the actual price of it to 19.99 per person. Never in my life had I heard of hidden fees at a restaraunt. Cars and homes? I understand. Dinner? are you kidding me?Our entire party furious, we spoke with the manager explaining the entire situation, and the most he did was take off all the mistakes, even still that was only done because of us claiming we wouldn't pay if it was corrected. To further rate this place, I'll do it on a rubric based out of 100 points. Food Speed: 30/100Food Quality: 50/100Service: 0/100Decor: 65/100Price: 40/100Avoid, avoid, avoid. Service here is what kills it, and I know it wasn't just a bad day or just that particular waitress because I work at the starbucks in the same plaza ad see them regularly. Most of the staff is extremely rude and snobby.
1	DO NOT EAT HERE!!! WORST SERVICE EVER!! From management all the way down to the host.....Just plain BAD SERVICE! Now let me tell you about the food. The nigiri is overstuffed with rice and can barely make out the taste of the fish. Read this article below, I have never gotten sick from Sushi until now."When sushi is handled properly in a reputable establishment by a master sushi chef, the risk of getting a food-borne illness from eating it is extremely rare. According to FDA statistics, you have a much greater chance of getting sick from eating poultry or beef than from eating raw fish. But if you eat a spoiled piece of sushi, you won't care about statistics.While you can't possibly know if the raw fish was kept adequately refrigerated or whether the server or preparer properly washed his hands before handling your food, you can use your powers of observation to discover clues that may help you prevent putting your gastrointestinal health at the mercy of a less-than-reputable sushi restaurant" -eHow
5	I liked their service and sushi! I don't care what others saying bad about this place..they have good food and good special prices.Also, I like their naked sushi event as well too...it's something you'll not going to see anywhere..new experience to me.It's always nice to have new experience...I like this place!
5	I thought this place had closed their west side location but I was glad to find out they just relocated. My husband and I ordered the Geisha special which comes with Fillet Mignon, Chicken, Shrimp Lobster, appetizer, soup, salad ,fried rice and a drink for $35.95. My husband doesn't eat seafood so I let him have some of my steak and chicken in exchange for his seafood. When the chef first started to warm up by juggling the spatula and big barbecue fork I was scared. He kept missing ...I was thinking that fork was going to end up in my eye! He got better though...he threw an egg in the air and sliced it in half with the spatula ...I was impressed. The chef was very entertaining he took this bottle and it looked like it squirted at me but it was just a prank. He was also joking with my husband who accidentally thanked him in Spanish..I didn't think he caught it until he was packing up his stuff and as he left he said, "Gracias". Eric who was our server was also very nice and personable he says he makes the best Sake Bombs around . We didn't have a Sake bomb but we did have Sour Apple Sake which was very flavorful. The meal was good I LOVE their fried rice here. It's one of the best I've tried in a restaurant. They put this pink stuff that looks like watermelon sorbet in everything they cook. I don't know what it is but it makes everything yummy. These are large portions so between me and my husband we had a full take home box to enjoy during the week.
5	Geisha House is great, the price is great for as much food as you get. We always have the teppanyaki dinner, the show is either ok or really good depending on who is your chef. We've been here so many times that it doesn't really matter. We enjoy the funny banter between us and the chef. The watermelon(?) butter is delicious and turns all the food red. Very cool.Call ahead to make a reservation so you don't have to wait. Also, try the flavored sake!! I am not a fan of regular sake but I loved the flavored versions!
4	The best Thanksgiving is having sushi...Me and the hubby don't like the traditional Thanksgiving food simply because it's just too much food and we don't like turkey.Because our favorite sushi place wasn't open we decided to try Geisha Sushi.At this restaurant, there is a tepanyaki side and a sushi side.  We ate at the sushi side by the bar with the flat screens.We ordered the rainbow sashimi salad, miso soup, and salmon, spicy scallop, yellow tail, and egg sushi.  All very fresh to the palate and the miso soup was thick.  Service was very good and maybe because it was Thanksgiving they gave us extra pieces of the sushi nigiri.This will be a good Thanksgiving tradition!
5	Geisha!  Wow!  I never realized what a great place to go to for Sashimi!  I always thought it was just a nice Teppanaki house.  But we sat at the sushi bar new years eve and had a great time getting served by the head chef.  Squid & Octupus really goood!  Nice house Sake too and I generally don't like sake.Nice job by the friendly staff!  See you again.
4	Fun and tasty hibachi place. Kids really like it
5	When we're in the mood for some entertainment and teppanyaki, Geisha House is where we go.  This is great place for kids and family.At the times we've gone it wasn't busy at all... This is usually around 7 or 8pm at night on a weekday.The last time we were here we took my son for his birthday and he absolutely loved it.  The chefs there are awesome and their tricks are fun to watch.  I really want to try the onion volcano at home!   It was funny to watch them sing happy birthday to him as well.He had so much fun, after we left he let us know that he wants to be a chef and do what they do.We've had their Steak and Chicken and it is delicious and worth the price.  The fried rice is delicious.  They have this red buttery sauce they put on everything.  I find that we always take home food, so the food to price ratio is right on.Our drinks were always full, the staff was extremely friendly, especially to our children, the place is clean and the atmosphere is fun!
5	I *LOVE* this place!  I used to go to the old one on Durango/DI all the time.  The Geisha Special is where it's at.  Miso soup, Salad, Appetizer (I like the shrimp tempura), Filet, lobster, shrimp, chicken and fried rice...oh my!  I usually split it with someone and STILL have leftovers.  The ambiance is nice, the chefs are entertaining and the food is awesome.  I just wish I could figure out what the heck is in the salad dressing...mmmmm...
5	Wonderful sushi, very reasonable pricing & OUTSTANDING service. We sat at the sushi bar & just wanted to grab a bite- because we were on the go. The gentleman who sat us was extremely outgoing & very welcoming (unlike a majority of the other sushi joints we regular). On top of that, the sushi chef who served us was possibly the sweetest man to ever work behind a sushi bar. Not only was he friendly, but he made us a special snack on the house. We will definitely return for teppanyaki & $5 lemon drop martinis!
1	Naked Sushi Event:NEGATIVE 100,000,000 stars.  I should have given my $$ to some homeless guy.  The naked models had good plastic surgeons though. Very interesting... but don't waste your money.
1	**Naked Sushi Event**       - Price - It was $46 + $5 mandatory tip. They gave you one drink coupon that was good for only bottled water or domestic beer.       - Food - What I listed in the food section is all the food they offer. I didn't miss anything. The selection is THAT limited.       - Buffet Style - The food is laid out buffet style around a hibachi chef and sushi model.       - Drinks - You didn't get waiter service for drinks. You have to go to the bar to get drinks and they don't offer plain water (it had to be bottled). What kind of place doesn't offer water? Even clubs offer water!       - Groupon - I paid $23 since I had a groupon and I still think I got ripped off.       - Models - They had two rotating models in panties, pasties, and banana leaves on them. The highlight of the night was watching guys try to hit on them or try to get the pieces of sushi on their bodies. No, the sushi on the models was just for show and you couldn't grab them if anyone was wondering.       - Health Code Violations - With the exception of the fried rice, all the hot foods were cold. Some of the hot foods were on heating trays and some weren't. However, none of the fires under the trays were on.       - Live Music - They had a DJ playing songs the whole night.       - Rip Off - From their mandatory tip (for no service), to their disallowance of getting water, to their limited selection of food, to their overload of fried rice and nigiri rice, to the pathetic selection of sushi rolls, I get a sense that they're really blatantly and unabashedly trying to rip off their customers.**Food**       - Fried Rice - Pretty much just fried rice with a couple specs of overcooked chicken hidden in. They fill half your plate with rice hoping to fill you up.       - Tempura - They had shrimp and vegetable tempura. It was cold and over battered.       - Egg Rolls/Gyoza - I'd say it's comparable to $5 buffets in downtown.       - Chicken Skewers - They were overcooked, dry, and way below room temperature. I believe that's a health code violation.       - Sushi - The first time we went around they had california rolls, spicy tuna rolls, some kind of shrimp tempura roll, and a plate of nigiri. The second time we went around, it was 70% california rolls/spicy tuna rolls and a couple shrimp tempura rolls. I guess nigiri was costing them too much.       - Rice - The couple nigiri I grabbed the first time had way too much rice in it.**Recommendations**       - I wouldn't recommend this place if I had a gun to my head. I mean, not getting waiter service for drinks?  What was the mandatory tip for? Serving over salted foods and not allowing water? Is that even legal?
4	We had a teppanyaki dinner for 4 here tonight and walked away very happy! Good service, good presentation, friendly staff and great food. You get the usual egg roll, volcano and the choo choo train but that's part of the fun and we all had a good laugh along with our chef.We didn't try any sushi and missed out on the naked girls but we had a great experience and will definitely be returning.
4	Geisha House is misunderstood.  Browsing the reviews listed here, you see reviews about shabu shabu, their teppanyaki, or the naked sushi events.  This is the first place I tried shabu shabu, and I enjoyed it, but they stopped doing that about five years ago.  The teppanyaki seems to get pretty good ratings from other reviewers; I've never had it.  And the naked sushi...well, I went after purchasing the Groupon, and if that is your introduction to the sushi at Geisha House I can understand why people wouldn't want to return.  So why do I still think Geisha House deserves a second chance?  The sushi bar!  Let me explain...Take a look at their sushi menu: http://www.geishasteakhouse.co.kr/geisha/sushi/.  The food I've ordered actually looks pretty darn close to those pictures.  They know that presentation is part of the experience, and put in the effort to present your dish the way it was meant to be.  As far as the quality of the fish, the sushi chef has always been upfront with me when I ask what's fresh.  "Today we just got in some toro."  "Don't get the uni, we haven't had a recent shipment."  "I suggest getting the yellowtail and albacore, it's really good quality today."  Totally honest with the recommendations!  Really, who tells you not to order something, or admits that an item at their restaurant isn't fresh?  One night I was finishing up dinner, and I saw the sushi chef preparing a large variety of sashimi.  I asked about it, and he said that when he gets a shipment in he prepares samples for the waitstaff so that they know exactly what they're talking about when customers ask for recommendations, or ask how different fish taste.  It's this kind of service that I really appreciate, instead of being told the standard, "Oh, everything is good."If you went to a naked sushi event, give them another chance.  Seriously.  Sit at the sushi bar.  Ask questions.  Enjoy the service, quality, presentation, and most importantly, let's all pretend naked sushi never happened.
4	Excellent staff and phenomenal ambience to the restaurant! You will not leave hungry!
1	I have never ate here before during their normal menu hours. I have been to the one on DI when they were open but this is my first time at the new location. This review is for the groupon purchase of the -Naked Sushi Event- only.When you purchase the groupon a reservation is required. They only hold this even on specific days out of the month and it starts very late. Our reservation was for Oct 22, 2011 at 10:30. Once inside you HAD to pay a mandatory $5 gratuity which was not stated any where on the groupon that right there already pissed me off. You were also handed a drink coupon as mentioned in the groupon. Food: set up around 1 hibachi table buffet style and you just go around and help yourself. Two models taking turns lying on the table wearing pasty flowers and nude panties with banana leaves covering the appropriate areas. They did have sushi laid on the leaves, but you were not permitted to eat the pieces of sushi off the model. -Sushi: the night started off well with a semi large variety. California rolls, nigiri (salmon, tuna, yellow tail, shrimp)  I think they made the rice portion a little larger than normal. They had some specialty rolls like spider rolls and 2 concoctions that I don't know the name of but were pretty tasty, and spicy tuna rolls. I was able to make about 2 rounds with a pretty decent selection. At round 3 all the nigiri was gone and everything was replaced with California rolls and maybe one plate of spicy tuna. -Sides: EVERYTHING they had as a side that was supposed to be hot was COLD!!!!! gyoza was not crunchy even when I got there just a little after I saw it come out of the kitchen. I didn't try the egg rolls, the shrimp tempura was starting to get a little soggy and was just barely a little past warm. Chicken skewers were awful COLD and dry. They also had a beef side that also was not favorable. -Fried rice: was made fresh. The rice I will have to say tasted like butter. It was so oily and I just felt like I was gaining a pound every time I took a bite. That didn't help the flavor either. I know you need a little bit of fat to make stuff taste good but that was gross. The chef tried to give me a whole scoop but I told him right away to give me 1/2 of that because 1. I didn't want to waste it and 2. you don't want to get full off of rice. - DJ was pretty impressive. Had a good mix going on the whole night. - Service:No one comes by your table to explain this to you or to let you know that there will not be waiter service. We had to ask the hostess after she was done sitting another party where our waiter was. she explained that if we needed any beverages we would have to go to the bar. WATER! don't expect to you get any water during your meal at this event. We went to the bar and asked for water and was told that they were not permitted to give out regular water and they for the night they were only serving bottle water that they were CHARGING you for. If you didn't want to pay for the bottled water you could use your drink coupon for it instead. WTF!! who doesn't serve water at a restaurant?!! They were actually refusing us water. expect a busser that constantly cleared the table. when I say clear I mean he took: the chop sticks, soy sauce dish, and your wasabi/ginger dish. so every time you came back to your table you had to start all over.I would not recommend going to this event.
4	Love this location!  I created NAKED SUSHI at Geisha House a few years ago and  I'm glad to see they kept it going since I left.  Food is great and the staff are very nice!
3	If you have never experienced hibachi, you should give it a whirl.  If you have, then you can probably write this review yourself.  Hibachi is definitely a fun way to have an OK dinner with a bunch of people.Geisha is no different than any other.  I had the New York Steak for $21.  The meal comes with soup, salad, shrimp, fried rice, and veggies.  Everything was A-OK, except the salad.  The salad was yucky white translucent iceberg...that stuff doesn't even count as lettuce.  Seriously? Other than that, everything was tasty as expected.  My steak was a lovely med rare and the veggies nice and crisp.  The performance from our chef was exactly as I've seen it before.  It think there is some sort of standardized testing for these guys...It seems like they all follow the exact same script.  That said, he was very nice and friendly and did a good job cooking our grub.
2	great staff nice place fun to go to once   fun to watch show/table cooking         i have been here three times    but the food   i have ordered all types   surf and turf ,meat lover etc   the problem is all the food is seasoned the same so it all tastes the same from the rice veg's and meats or seafood    food quality not that good portion are small except the fried rice witch is cheep all deserts are frozen from outside source oh ya they  have a lot of watered down overpriced drinks too  $220 for four people what a joke
4	Pretty good tepanyaki experience.  The geisha house fried rice is quite good. Definitely one of the best places to eat in the area.
2	ooookkkk... So, having been to the original Geisha House on the East Side I have to say this one isn't as good.  First the service was poor. The host was good the waitress - Rosa I think.  Could barely understand her.  She did the minimum ok but that was it.  The seating and decor is very modern but not as comfy as the one on the East Side.  Also, there were all these stipulations - you can order the Geisha special but you can't share it and if you share it it's $10.95. Ok, no problem.  So, we ordered two Geisha Specials for three people and paid the "share fee" no problem.  Then the "appetizer" comes Yakatori and Veggie tempura. Two sticks of Yakatori and five tempura.  This is TWO Geisha Specials ($71)?  Ok.  So they are yummy I will say that.  Also the onion and ONE mushroom soup broth thing was delish even though it hardly had anything in it.  So ok.  Then they come to cook our meal at a table we shared with a family of four (two kids and two adults) and we personally got ONE steak, two chicken, two tiny lobsters and some shrimp.  Didn't look like two Geisha specials to me.  Further the spice/seasoning level is WAY DOWN from the one on the east side. You know how good their rice is (if you don't, it is) and this location's rice needed soy sauce.  Didn't even add any heat to it at all.  So in short, it was OK.  But not worth the money. If you want to truly experience how good Geisha House can be - go to the one on the East Side if it's still there.
4	Went to this restaurant when it first opened and loved it! We ordered sushi, teppanyaki style shrimp and steak and had the dream bobba for dessert. The food was top notch and the service was better. The manager even sent us a round of drinks on the house just to thank us for dining.
5	My husband and I have been visiting Geisha House for a few years now.  When he finds something he likes, he will eat it 2-3 times a week!  Sometimes we sat at the bar so I could enjoy sushi while he had his steak. Sometimes we sit at the hibachi and sometimes we just take it to go.  We are ALWAYS greeted in a friendly manner even if we have to wait a few minutes for a server to come to the bar.  As bartenders, we are OK with that.  My ONLY complaint about the cooked food is this red-butter substance that they smother on everything.  Sure it tastes good....but I have issues with all of my food coming out the same color.Back in October we became vegan-ish ;)  We REALLY started missing the GH so we decided to stop in and see what sort of meal options we could come up with.  We ordered the tofu dinner a few times.  Although it came out different each time, it was always good.  Then I had a conversation with Yoshi, one of the sushi chefs, about our new food lifestyle.  He was more than understanding and we didn't feel awkward for sitting at a sushi bar but not ordering fish.  He used everything from tempura asparagus, to sweet potatoes, to jalapenos to create some of THE BEST sushi rolls I've ever had.  Fish or NO FISH.  All of the sushi chefs there are wonderful :)Ji, one of the managers, knows us by name now.  Whenever we call for takeout he just asks if we are having our usual (2 vegan rolls, 2 miso soups and veggie tempura).  I am SO grateful that this location is mere minutes from our home and we will continue to be regulars of the Geisha House.
4	This was a spur of the moment choice for dinner Saturday night..they were kinda busy so the sat us at the bar..Bartender super cute personality and suggested the blue raspberry sake which was pretty good..We waited maybe 10 minutes before being seated..Decided to split the special which was soup/salad/appetizer/entree (shrimp, lobster, filet mignon, and chicken) OMG it was AMAZING!! The salad was really good w/the ginger dressing..tempura veggies were greatness..the entree (because my date is allergic to seafood, I got the lobster and shrimp) And it was beyond delicious..The chicken and steak were pretty good for the bite that I received lol..All and all a great experience!
5	My wife Susan L. loves this place, we ate here last night it was great! The Hibachi Chef gave us some great tips for next time since I am so picky. He has been our chef before and did a great job then and now! I don't remember his name though. We got the Geisha Special as usual. His tip was  even though the Geisha Special comes with Filet Mignon, Chicken, Shrimp, Lobster, appetizer, soup, fried rice and a drink (by far the Green Apple sake was the best); you can ask to switch from Shrimp to Filet Mignon or what ever you want. They have a Naked Hibachi meal that seems pretty cool, it is exactly what you think (Susan this a hint!)
4	Have been here a few times and really love it!  The prices are reasonable and the service is A++!  Great sake sampler and all of their choice of sushi is excellent.  They have a sense of humor with the names of their Rolls which makes it alittle embarrassing to order out loud in mixed company but FUN.  Like going here for larger groups as the hibachi chef's make it fun and their red fried rice is very tasty!
4	My wife and I went here today for lunch and sat at the sushi bar. We were both VERY impressed with the sushi!I had a "Secret from your husband" roll and was BLOWN AWAY by how good it was! Super delicious, very fresh fish and just incredible. I also asked the sushi chef for a recommendation and he made a special roll for me that was also very good.My wife had a "Geisha" roll and a "Mexican Tempura" roll and she thought it was amazing as well!The prices were in line with your normal sushi place, 4 cut rolls were around $50. Needless to say, we will both be going back, and HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for good sushi!Thanks Yelp for the recommendation!
4	awesome time! went on a weekday so not too crowded....very clean. Me the wife went with our baby girl. Good food. If you've ever been to a place like this you know exactly what to expect. Not gourmet but hits the spot.  Good time and not too expensive
3	The food is good and teppan is always fun.  I like the pink rice they make on the flat top, too.  Even though their tricks are the usuals, they're still very entertaining.
5	I drug my fiance (kicking and screaming mind you...) here tonight for dinner.  I had dined at Geisha years ago when it was at DI and Durango, but since moving to Rhodes have been dying to go back.We call ahead for reservations, place them with ease for 7:30, and dressed up for the evening (sometimes its nice for no apparent reason).  We arrive at Geisha around 7:00pm and are easily seated early, even though the place is relatively crowded.  (Fun sidenote:  My name is "Rich", which is the name I used to place the reservation, but "Witch" was written in the reservation book when we got there.  God Bless the Japanese accent!).  Service is immediately stellar.  We are seated, drinks are ordered, soup and salad are in front of us within 4 minutes.  Everyone is friendly and smiling, they had a rotating group of employee's coming by fairly frequently, but not enough to annoy, to check on our experience.Our chef comes out, I regret not catching his name, and is incredibly pleasant and quite skilled. I love Teppanyaki for the show, and the food is a bonus.  He does all of the usual tricks and portions are huge.  I ordered the Filet Mignon, which was perfectly seared, perfectly seasoned.  The fried rice had a red tint that I had not seen before, but the flavor was amazing.  The vegetables were killer, the shrimp - to die for!Michelle ordered the Chicken and had them add Seasame seeds, a good choice.  This was arguably the best chicken I have ever tasted.  We had plenty of food to share amongst each other.  A great food experience!I have found a new local favorite and will be back.  Total bill:  Filet Mignon, Chicken, 2 soda's - $56.  A steal for the quality!
3	Food was great... Teppanyaki chefs really made my son trip too there enjoyful..Only down fall.. Was their drinks sucked big time ...
4	It's New Years day, friends are in town and we need a place to eat, has to be Geisha house, but wait a minute, the eastside is closed ! WTF, seriously, nooooooooAt this point the group wants teppanyaki, one of the group comes up with Benihana ! Seriously, I had to drag her away to have a quiet chat about good food, silly lady.Anyways, a quick phone call later and we find that the location in the southwest is open, so a 20 minute drive.Same menu, nice decor, let's eat.Well there are some differences, this location seems to use more teriyaki and less secret sauce, mmm not so good...Service was ok, but we are used to the eastside location where in fairness we are known so are drinks come to the table without having to order. However, plates were left on the tables for a while before the busperson got around to collecting them. But drinks were refilled quickly, so ok, they get a pass.The food, well yes it had more teriyaki than normal, but the Geisha House taste was still there, so it was good, I will say, with 7 of us around the table there wasn't the normal flow to the food coming on to the plate, this is to be expected, but again, the eastside manages to get the food on the plate quickly.So food is good, service was ok, a couple of small things I really liked.My wife asked about the knife the chef was using, he gave us probably a 10 minute lecture (I use that phrase in a good way) about the different types of knives to use for cooking and how the knife he uses for the grill is actually pretty cheap (because he goes through them quickly due to metal on metal) but he keeps is razor sharp and he even gave my wife some ideas on new kitchen knives for her. Of course it was only after getting home that I found out how much a Bob Kramer knife costs lolAlso the manager was a lot of fun, he checked on us a couple of times during the meal and even comped us desert and a round of drinks to welcome in the new year, love it.One little feature that I will be trying, they have grills out on the patio, once the weather warms up we will have to give that a try.So all in all a good meal.
5	Took my boyfreind for his birthday. Had fun. Joshua the hibachi master was hillarious. Good times had.
1	TERRIBLE experience. Came in with family from out of town, we wanted to give them some sort of entertainment while they ate. Our server was BEYOND rude, she argued with us the entire night. We had asked from the very beginning to split checks. My mother has just had gastric bypass surgery so she really can't eat a whole lot (& i literally mean she cant eat more than 5 bites) so her and I were just going to split something, so the server said we had to pay an extra $10.95 to split, we said ok That was fine. But when our food arrived, 5 of us had to split ONE 6 oz filet mignon, one chicken breast, and one lobster. So we paid an extra 11 dollars per person to get extra rice and vegetables that we never received because the other group of people across from us wanted extra rice and meat so all of our portions were given to them. So now we were not onlyPaying for extra food we didn't receive but other guests were getting our food.  Our waitress did not ask us once how we were doing but she certainly managed to ask her other table about 6 times and has no problem taking shots and doing sake bombs with another table. The chef was fabulous, Joseph, I believe was his name. He was excellent. So then when we asked for our checks to be split, again, the waitress threw a fit and told us FLAT OUT no. So we asked to speak to the manager, JI, he was not helpful either. Not to mention we couldn't even understand half of what he was saying. He fought with us as well although he at least did try to make things right for us in a sense. We said we were not going to pay the gratuity to the server because she was terrible but instead wed like the tip to go to the chef. Not sure if that happened but I hope so. We were not looking for a free meal or anything like that all but the gesture would have been nice, instead we just left all pissed off. Needless to say, we will not be back. Not to this location at least. Terrible terrible service and management. Awesome chef though!
5	I've been coming here for longer than I can remember and I love love love it! Did I mention I love Geisha's?! Some people may think it's cheesy to sit at a grill and watch a chef preform tricks and crack silly puns while preparing your food, but I get the biggest kick out of it! The best is bringing people here who have never experienced teppanyaki/hibachi. Some people say "well how about Benihana's???", well I say pffffff.... that place is for tourists!  :) My main reason for raving that Geisha's is better is that they this secret sauce when they are cooking on the grill.. It's like a pink butter (we call it watermelon butter) It's delicious and tastes so much better than that other place. I get the Geisha special every time. Filet, Chicken & lobster, it also comes with shrimp, fried rice, veggies, miso soup, salad & Saki. It's all a good deal and what's even better is I can never finish it and It makes for a great leftovers. If you don't want to gorge yourself on teppanyaki then they do offer a sushi bar as well. I've read on YELP it's pretty amazing.This will always be one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. We've done Geisha's for New Years, Birthday's, casual dinners, and have used it for an excuse to drink way too much saki! Now that I think about, I want to have my 35th B-day party at Geisha's this summer! Everyone's invited!
1	Never again!The food was cheap ($25 for 5 rolls) but the service was awful. I guess you get what you pay for:1) the servers will yell across the room at each other. This is a sushi restaurant, not a bar!2) they have no shame in reaching across your face (arm right in face) to drop off the plates. Yes drop- it was definitely not subtle how they did it.3) the server insisted to box my food for me, even after I declined. She dropped a piece of fish and I told her not to worry about that. Then...she drops another piece...and picks both up from the table and stuffs it into the to go box. Gross!!
4	The design/decor wasn't that great. It was just one big open space. They are definitely over priced (but we knew that before coming here) Service was very good though. We ordered the geisha special and the appetizer was bigger then I had expected (I ordered the shrimp tempura).  It was verry yummy.  I loved the soup and salad. I just would've liked the salad to be a little bigger in portion size. Over all the dinner was great and sure I'd go back on a rare occasion, but yes it's pricey.
1	What's with the secret Pink sauces that they put on EVERYTHING when you have a teppanyaki dinner? Personally, I do not like artificial coloring on everything that I am eating. Pink rice, Pink shrimp, Pink Vegetables... I think they should ask you if you'd like the 'house sauce" on everything and it should be optional not standard.  I will not be returning here for teppayaki anytime soon, unless they remove the mandatory pink sauce rule.
4	First off, I have to say that this is the most beautifully designed restaurant I have ever been to. I was totally in awe and could not stop looking around at the decor throughout dinner. My waiter noticed and informed me on a couple of pieces, including the crazy expensive LED TV behind the sushi bar. The food was also very good and the presentation was great! Our waiter was very attentive and offered suggestions. We did not have the hibachi and instead just ordered off of the menu. The food was very good and reasonably priced, we will definitely be coming back!
1	Boy what a huge disappointment. Fried rice and 'scallops' that had a pink color..... Not kidding. What makes fried rice pink? And tasteless. I would never consider returning to this place. Soup was muchroom flavored broth. Salad would've been OK if it wasn't for the large inedible chunks of lettuce 'core'. I was VERY unhappy leaving here. Never again. Scallops were irregular 'pink' pieces that had no taste and were not cooked correctly. NEVER again.
5	Pink fried rice is awesome! And lemon butter shrimp is the best I've ever had!
5	5 stars for this place. I go to the laser hair removal center right next door and eat here about 4 times a week. Their lunch box is delicious. Service is prompt and friendly. Prices are reasonable. The sushi is fresh and they have the best spicy scallop hand roll in townFor dinner I have tried their teppenyaki.  It was amazing. You have to try their red fried rice. The food was fresh and the chief was very well trained. He did some fun tricks. I had the steak wife had the shrimp. Fairly priced for teppenyaki and I would recommend it to my friends.
3	Good food, chef was fun and good. Otherwise awful service and bad management. They wouldn't even help us with a very minor issue. There are enough other places like this in town that I will not be revisiting.
4	I purchased a Groupon shortly before coming here for dinner. My wife and I are big fans of sushi and we have tried several places in town. My review is strictly going to be about my experience at the sushi bar. They have the cooking tables for parties where a chef cooks in front of you, but I only had the luxury of witnessing that part of the restaurant in action from the sushi bar.Overall, the sushi was really good. They had nice quality fish and they dressed up all the rolls quite nicely when they serve it to you. The Decor in the place was contemporary and aesthetically pleasing. I was very happy when I found out that they serve beer by the pitcher because you get a better bargain than buying the glasses individually. Also, they serve spicy garlic edamame which I enjoy but my wife really enjoys and making wife happy is always a plus.The Sushi bar has a couple big-screen TVs where you can watch sporting events and seems like it would be a great place to catch a game if that's your thing. This restaurant is a little more higher end and so you won't be finding all you can eat sushi as part of the menu. I find that sushi that is served a la cart is better anyway. I was a little bummed that they didn't have Uni available because I'm huge fan but that isn't uncommon at a lot of places that serve sushi.Overall, the wife and I enjoyed a nice dining experience. I imagine we will be back in the near future since we are moving to the area next month.
3	Probably a 3.5 star rating would be more appropriate. Came in on a groupon with a friend.While it was nice and all, having every single one of my items red/pink-colored bothered me. He used red butter on absolutely everything. Our chef was really nice, though. It was cute to have him throw in the random humor and tricks of the trade.Food was decent, ALL red-colored, but nothing special. It doesn't stand out as a hibachi place I'll be coming back to anytime soon.Service was decent so no complaints there. But nothing special either.
3	Chef George was great and very personable. Dinner went well, but were very disappointed that the didn't have all the desserts in the menu, only the basic stuff. Even when I mentioned some of the drinks they didn't have either. Atmosphere is very nice and modern, but I have had better for less price.
5	If you haven't been here yet you have to try the Shushi!! The Shushi chef is the bomb!!!
3	Had an expired Groupon but thought I'd use the value towards lunch so boyfriend & I decided to come in during lunchtime. I was definitely confused on where the place was. The sign says Kanji Steakhouse, not Geisha House Steak & Sushi so be forewarned.We thought it would be busy but it wasn't at all inside. It seemed like they just opened but looking at their hours, they had been open for over 2 hours already. We were seated right away. The restaurant is just a big open space. Thought the interior was beautiful, pretty unique tables and benches.Ordered the Rib Eye Entree and the Combo Filet Mignon & Shrimp. They come with soup, salad and fried rice but OH MY OH MY, why so pricey? Lunch Specials did not apply to the Groupon; I wish it did. But no complaints there. Food was pretty tasty, generous portions. I just have had better, that's all.
4	I went here for a nice lovely dinner on a Holiday and loved it. The host and staff were very helpful. From observing our table and the other tables, it seemed everyone was enjoying themselves and having a good time at the cooking tables. We ordered the specials and was very impressed with their Chefs, he was very talented and interacted with us and the food was good. By the way the name of the place is Kanji Steakhouse.
