4	Nice people friendly atmosphere. They did a very nice job on my nails and the spa pedicure with callus remover and sugar scrub had a beautiful result. They have many styles of hand painted artwork and jewels for nails. Reasonably priced.
5	This place does awesome work and the prices are awesome too. The ladies here are all very nice and make you feel comfortable. I recommend this place!
5	Very friendly, relaxed salon. Great value and artwork from these ladies. They're always willing to please the client. The prices cant be beat in the area and theres hardly ever a wait. I get my pedis on a regular basis here and have been pleased with the eyebrow waxes too.
1	Worse $15 I have ever spent.   A joke of a pedicure. Little to no massage and the buffing of my feet was terrible.  They might be worse now.  Save your $15 for the delicious sushi next store.
2	Pedicure was ok .. Don't waste the money on the leg message could even tell she was touching me.. Pretty weak effort on her part reflected in her Tip!
4	Pros:Reasonable priceFriendly staffGreat selection of gel polish Good massage chairEasy to walk in or set up appointment Gel color will last long time Next to Sushi Catcher :-) Cons: Limited staff so they can do pedi and mini at the same timeWeak pedi massage and scribing This is my go to place for now...
5	Great place to get your nails done was very pleased with service this will be my spot from now on. See BB the nail technician she is great!
