5	I love Pet Club! I normally go to the location on 67th Ave & Bell Rd in Glendale, because it's closest to home. I needed to get dog food one day after work and wanted to find out if there was a location more along my route home. I was SO happy to see this location on Cave Creek! I always get my oil changes on my car at the Valvoline next door, so I knew this had to be brand new. When I asked the clerk, she said they had only been open one week. The store is big, bright, clean and the staff is friendly. I think this location will become my go-to.Pet Club has a huge selection of quality products for all sorts of pets and animals. I know nothing about horses, but it seems they have a lot of "feed & tack" stuff...whatever that is. Prices are also really great. The 40lb bag of dog food I buy runs at $40+ elsewhere, but at Pet Club, it's less than $35!
5	This is a great store for all pet owners who live in the area. Glad I found this store as they sell the brand of food my doggies eat. Make sure to check out this store.
4	I come here for a special food for my Black Lab.  I came here originally when the other place was sold out. They price matched it and were very professional about it.  I do think they it can be a tad higher so I try and buy when it is on promo.
5	The staff here are all friendly. One of the ladies had me bring in the brand I was feeding my dog and she reviewed the ingredients. She helped me find a brand that wasn't only comparable but better! Her knowledge was way better than the average big brand pet store employee. Love this place! Selection is great and staff really care.
