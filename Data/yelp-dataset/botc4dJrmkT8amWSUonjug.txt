1	terrible service!  the only advantage of this liquor store is it's close to the strip.  I went there to buy some liquor on a friday night and after I left the store, I couldn't find my phone.  So I called my cellphone to see if it's somewhere in my car.  The phone wasn't shut off and it wasn't in my car.  So I decided to call back the liquor store.  the person said they didn't find any phone.  Then I asked if I can come back and check myself.  The person said sure but insisted they didn't find my phone there.  However, when I called my phone again right after I told them I was coming back to check, it was shut off.  I don't know if it was just a coincidence or they were scared of my phone might ring when I come back to check and call it again.  And just to be fair to them, I clearly remembered talking on the phone with one of my friends before heading over to the liquor store.  So the chance that I lost my phone in the liquor store is very highly! On top of that, the liquor is ghetto as hell and doesn't have plastic cup for customers.  What kinda of a liquor store is it if it doesn't even have cups?Don't go there if you don't want to lose your phone !
4	I don't know WHY the only review here gives this place 1-star! I got GREAT SERVICE!  Came on a Saturday afternoon, and bought 2 cases of beer along with some liquor and a few bottles of water... the cashier spoke great English, rang me up quickly, and even offered to help me out to my car with my purchases. Cool beans.(If you lose your phone in a liquor store, that sounds like a personal problem.)
3	Seemed fine. A liquor store close to the strip with a nice selection. Even had Tito's Vodka, otherwise known as the greatest vodka on Earth, for around 20. Bonus: Found 5 flavors of Four Loko. Suffice to say, this all amounted to a nice little party in my room. And then my pants! Because I spilled some on myself.
