5	Such great professionals! Very efficient and caring! I have had 2 laser removal sessions and there has been such a drastic change for the better!
5	This is my first experience with getting a tattoo removed and this was the first place I went.  Very friendly and professional staff.  I don't necessarily regret getting the tattoo I did, but I am very thankful that MD Laser is in the business that they are so that I have the option of getting ink removed.  I highly recommend MD Laser!
5	Recently had derma-planing done here. Great service, nice people, and warm atmosphere. Great prices also!
5	Competitive prices friendly staff, will use them again in the future.
