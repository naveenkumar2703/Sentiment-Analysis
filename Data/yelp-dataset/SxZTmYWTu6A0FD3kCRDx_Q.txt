5	Lovely staff, the cashier Yodit was very helpfully store was very clean . They always have the cheapest gas in town
4	I like this AM/PM for one reason; Cheap Gas!! This station, along with the location at Decatur & Washington, always have the lowest priced gas on the westside of town. It always amazes me that people will stop at the unnamed station a block away and pay 40 cents a gallon more than the same product is sold for at this station.
4	Wanna get cheap gas? Come here!I've always only come here for gas. Lately its been 3.58$ and everywhere else is 3.80$. The only crappy part is that if you dont wanna pay cash there is a .35 cent fee for using debit. But thats better than paying that per gallon. Its also on the corner acorss from Fantastik so its easy to get in and out.
4	Good coffee, lots of flavor choices, and creamers. Usually very clean, cheap gas, lotsa snacks. I appreciate the diversity in their COLD soda choices. They seem to keep a lot of choices and replace them as they are bought instead of simply loading 5 choices in the fridge and calling it good. The ATM at the gas pump almost always works, a rarity at gas pumps in the hot days of summer.
