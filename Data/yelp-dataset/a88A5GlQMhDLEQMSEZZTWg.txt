5	This is an excellent, modern facility with good security and very friendly, helpful service.  We moved in a couple months ago and have been very pleased with everything.  Our sales guy was helpful but no-pressure, and continues to stay in touch to be sure we are happy.  The security guys are friendly and helpful.  The design of the facility is well done and highly reliable.
5	Feels like home. DataCenter galore.
