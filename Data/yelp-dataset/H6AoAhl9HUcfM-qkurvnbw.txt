5	Bar far the best haircut I have ever received. I recently moved from Arizona to Seattle and I have not been able to find a barber that can match Ely. I highly reccomend! He is very precise and takes his time to ensure that he gives the best cut possible.
5	The owner is from NYC and escaped the hustle and bustle of the big city.  He knows his stuff, excellent barber. Excellent service - went over and beyond what I asked for.  I have been looking for a good barber on this side of town.  Finally found it.
5	This is a great barbershop good work and decent prices.
5	Definitely one of the best barbers on the westside of town. Ely takes his time and makes sure you are satisfied. I have tried a few different barbers around town and this is the best spot by far! I recommend this spot if you're looking for a great and friendly barber!
3	Every time I've been at this shop Ely hooks it up with a really nice cut!  Also make sure to go when it's not busy since he's the only barber.
5	I've been around the world and have grown to appreciate real barbers like they have throughout Turkey. Here Armen is a master. Don't be fooled by the simple decor and older neighborhood. This place is a buried treasure if you want a real cut by someone who enjoys their work. He came from Uzbekistan then to NYC then to Scottsdale now he owns this place in Glendale. It's worth a trip. Get the works: hair beard mustache.
