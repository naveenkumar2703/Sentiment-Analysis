2	Taste Market & Deli is located on the first floor of The Market at Tivoli Village.  The second floor is home to several little boutique shops and the View Wine Bar and Kitchen.  My son and I decided to check it out after school one day since it's on the way home.  A nice open space that calls to mind an arty New York loft, Taste has two pinball machines, a pool table, and a Ms PacMan machine, a plus if there ever was one in my book. Customers have the option to build their own sandwich or salad. The teen chose a chicken sandwich on sourdough. I kept it light with a bowl of tomato bisque and a side of mac n cheese.  The sandwich and the tomato soup came out fairly quickly, but I ended up waiting another 20 minutes for the mac n cheese.  Apparently, hot food items are prepared by the View Kitchen upstairs.  After the first ten minutes, our waitress apologized for the wait and said that the kitchen had gotten backed up with orders.  We were the only customers downstairs in Taste, so I assumed the View upstairs was swamped.  After another ten minutes of waiting for a side dish and another apology from the waitress, I was ready to leave.  My son had finished his sandwich and the tomato soup was long gone, so when the food finally arrived, I was underwhelmed by the place, Ms PacMan or not.  The mac n cheese was actually good, made with wheat pasta; my son proceeded to eat half of it, so that's a good sign.  Considering we were the only customers in the place on a Friday at 2:00pm, I'd expect better service from a new place like this.  We may be back, but probably just to play Ms. PacMan.
