5	Great landfill. Most of its inside and well maintained the only landfill that doesn't stink!!! If your a city of Phoenix residence you are allowed one free dump so go check it out!
5	I can't say I have very much dump experience, but I think this place would spoil a visit at any other dump. It's well organized, the people are friendly and best of all, it doesn't completely reek! The last time I was there, they gave us a friendly reminder that any uncovered load would be fined starting soon. So remember that you must throw a tarp over your stuff, no matter how little!
1	What a line on the weekend....the people in the office could be more organized and the rent a cop could stop trying to wave his arms and talk less!  Get people in and out!
5	Citizens of Phoenix utilize a benefit that you pay for monthly!!!!  Bring an id and a current water bill and drop your bulk trash monthly!  Thus place is awesome and if you have a child bring them for the display of heavy machinery at work. I love coming here although it is a chore it removes unwanted bulk items from my home. Time to live yelpers!!!
5	Best freakin dump ever haha. Helpful employees, doesn't stink, and well organized. Seriously awesome!
