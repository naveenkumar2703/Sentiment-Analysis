4	This is a great store, but the taco shop inside is the real jewel.  Any taco you want is only $1!  I crave their tacos, which are some of the best I've ever had.  They also have aquitas, plate lunch and tortas.  The only draw-back is that maybe 15% of the staff speaks English.
5	I've actually been here a ridiculous amount of times but I never considered checking in. They have a great mexican food place inside with wonderful specials. They also have their own tortilleria where you can see them making tortillas.There is a bakery in the back and they always have pan dulce in stock.I haven't really checked out their produce section but it seems pretty inexpensive. Honestly, I go for the restaurant inside which is great!
4	If you're into great deals this place rocks. I've recently started canning and preserving foods in my home. Of course this requires lots and LOTS of produce at times. Now living in Vegas it's really not an option to grown your own easily and I just don't have time. Best deals i've found on fresh fruits and veggies in town! Every Wednesday they run specials on certain items and at times it can be SUPER cheap. if there's anything about me, I really like to save a buck when I can.  Not to mention they have a great taco spot inside, the people that work there are friendly and the store is clean. LOVE LOVE LOVE this spot :)
4	Its good but just needs to be more organized
4	Oh yea.. I come here for the marinated meat and the sweet breads. OMG.. Love it!
1	The worst burrito I ever purchase the burrito was drench in oil will never come to this place again, it reminded me of Tacos Mexico, best ones in Vegas is "Los Tacos" go there and you you will get hook there are so good, there a bit pricey but so worth it.
