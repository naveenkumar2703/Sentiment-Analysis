4	Walt's is a good choice for real BBQ in the desert. They offer traditional smoked BBQ with a variety of really amazing sauces. Pork, Brisket, Ribs, Chicken, offered up in a variety of ways. The sides are what you'd expect from a BBQ Joint: Cole Slaw, Baked Beans, Tater Salad, Fries, Mac'n'Cheese, and my favorite the smoked rice. The best part is that it's not that pricey, and you get a TON of food. On some nights, I've noticed they had a gentlemen in there providing live music - lots of blues, jazz, and the standard fair. He was actually really good! Give them a shot, it's something different in the West Valley and they make a mean set of ribs.

Also had the peach cobbler and the honny bunnies....OMG!!!  Amazing, absolutely amazing.     I'm going to check out the breakfast, seen the menu which is pretty small but its a great price and I know it will be fresh.   5 stars baby!    Loved it.
