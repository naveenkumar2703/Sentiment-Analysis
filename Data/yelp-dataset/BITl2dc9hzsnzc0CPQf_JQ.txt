5	Good foot open from 10 am to 3 am love that
4	Food is really good. Took an hour and 1/2 and I ask for napkins and they have me 1. Ordered 3 entrees and received 1 napkin. Really???  Wings require a lot of napkins. HELLO!!!!!
1	I am giving this place ONE star for the following reasons; first off the order took an hour and a half to be delivered. When we received our order, it was wrong. We paid extra for the thick crust on our pizza and also pepperoni. What we actually got was a PLAIN, COLD, cheese pizza that was thin and had obviously been sitting for a long time. We also ordered the Philly cheese steak sandwich. My husband is highly allergic to onions so we specified NO ONIONS on the sandwich, and what did it come with? ONIONS!!! After waiting an hour and a half for our order which was WRONG, obviously we were pretty irritated. We called them right away and got no answer. So we waited until the next day to call and complain. I can think of about fifty other things I'd rather spend $30 on than the horrible "meal" we received from this place. We spoke to Ray who identified himself as the owner and were casually dismissed and he told us he had to talk to the employees who worked the night before and blah blah and he said to call back tomorrow. He was rude and completely dismissed the situation. We will NEVER order from them again!!!!!!
