5	I will write a more extensive review when I am not on my phone, but the one thing I will say is that the previous reviewer is either an idiot or a liar.Rude?!?  Really?  The owner of this establishment is one of the kindest, friendliest human beings I've ever met.  And lying about the prices?  You mean the ones clearly posted on the counter?  Balderdash.I have been coming to this dry cleaners for YEARS and can assure any potential customer that this is one of the best and most affordable cleaners in town.
5	I have lots of pricey pieces for work and this is the only dry cleaner that I've been to in the past 15 years living in Las Vegas that didn't ruin my clothes on a regular basis. It's not a cheap place, but I feel the prices are fair. And if I have an unusual outfit (like a beaded gown), I just ask for the price up front to avoid any surprises. Plus, the owner always seems like a nice guy who's very appreciative of my repeat business.
5	I love to save  money and this is by far one of the cheapest places in town! They have specials all the time. I was trying to have my comforter clean and most places were asking for $30-$50 dollars, until I found cheyenne cleaners. I only had to pay 12.99 for it!!! I believe shirts are only 1.50 and they also offer tailor services!  I totally recommend them!
