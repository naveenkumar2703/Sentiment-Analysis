4	good service.  excellent selection of sandwiches.  recommend the pastrami or the sorbesotta (sp?).  only been there once, but definitely worth it.
5	Did you know this place also makes pizza? And that said pizza is possibly the best carry out pizza in a 5+ mi radius?  It's true.  Sure they only offer 1 size, and sure they aren't open on Sundays and close early every other day of the week, but that really doesn't matter.  If you like Tony's Pizza (the original BC version), you will like this.  Rich tomato-y sauce (the highlight of my pizza-eating experiences) with yeasty flavorful crust. Lots of cheese (their normal cheese at times is almost like asking for extra cheese anywhere else) & big pepperoni slices.  I have no idea what other toppings are available.  Also, some of their desserts are quite delicious.
5	Great taste of back east.  The sausage is fresh made each morning and they have a pretty good variety.  The Sweet w/ Fennel is our standby though we also enjoyed the spicy and the sweet w/out fennel.  They also offer something (ok fine, several things) that I have never seen this far away from the tri-state area pinwheel sausage for grilling.  They carry a great variety of pastas, sauces, even frozen knishes and raviolis (the kinds you see back east, not the kind you see in the supermarket).  Also their Italian bread is great.
