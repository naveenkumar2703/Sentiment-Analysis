5	I was pleasantly surprised that the fitness center was included with the Luxor room (the convenience fee covered the cost).  Even though I read this really fine print in the materials we received at check in.... I still expected to pay an additional fee like most other hotels on the strip.  Once I got over that, I was expecting a small 2 treadmill gym and man was I wrong!   This is a full gym with plenty of treadmills and stationary bikes, and 6 elliptical's.  There is a full set of free weights, bench press with it's own full set of weights.   Medicine balls (5), yoga mats, ab rollers, stair stepper, exercise balls, plenty of TV's positioned in front of the machines.  They had sanitary wipes to clean the machines before and after you used them.  They provided towels and water   I was really impressed, the Luxor got it right!  I posted lots of pictures!  The center is located in the West tower, casino floor level, inside the spa and near the pool.  If you're looking for it then you can't miss it. It was great to get a workout in with all these buffets around.
3	Weight area was Very small, and limited. Kinda uncomfortable. Had to get my pump before I hit the pool.
1	Great gym for a motel 6 not a 5,000 room hotel. At 6am there was not one available piece of equipment. I had to do crunches in my room instead. I can do a thousand now.
4	Decent sized gym with pretty new equipment. Considering that the gyms in the last 2 hotels I stayed in since I started my fitness journey a year and a half ago were tiny with a few out dated machines, I was pleasantly surprised when came here.
