3	Customers of Razmataz:Paul BunyanThe Jolly Green Giant (you know, on the cans of corn!)Dom DeluiseYes. BIG furniture for big people. And while they have a tremendous selection, nothing really fits my style. Lots of beautiful carved wood pieces and plenty of wrought iron. It's sort of goth meets Aspen meets Lane Bryant.
4	Holy crap Thomas is spot on, hilarious.  The first thing I thought when I first walked in this place was "I'm feeling mighty little".  Big heavy pieces for sure, dark woods, carved, unique.  You need a big space to show off this stuff.  Lots of Mexicali knicker knackers.  I still have a few pieces with me here in Hotlanta, but it doesn't quite fit anymore....Anyone want to buy it?  Shipping is only $5,000....
4	Drool.  This place is my own personal furnishing heaven.  The first time I walked in here I think I literally gasped.  I have always tried to describe my ideal decorating scenario and the best I could come up with was things you would find in a castle.  Yeah..like a castle. Cuz I'm goth like that.  And..voila..Razmataz.  As for it being furnishings for big folks, I am ok with that.  In fact, I am wiling to get fat in order for it to look more appropriate and to scale.  One problem.  My eyes are bigger than my wallet.  Champagne taste on a beer budget if you will.  But a girl can dream....and drool...Ahhhh...anyone wanna help me put together my Ikea entertainment center?
1	I will never make another purchase from this company ever again! The company tried to deliver damaged furniture to my home and then gave me the run around about processing a refund when I refused to accept the items. After 5 phone conversations, they agreed to refund me for refusing damaged items. I cannot recommend this to anyone.
