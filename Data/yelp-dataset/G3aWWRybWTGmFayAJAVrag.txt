1	Purchase GroupOn and the company didnt honor the coupon.  So I purchased the Kraut Classic - Sauer kraut had burn black pieces. Then tried again with an ice cream cone.. How can you mess up an ice cream cone, right?? Frost biten ice cream!! Horrible experience all around. Wouldn't go back.
5	Just like they make them in NY! Great job and good luck
3	Oh no..Im too late for my write up about the snappy well seasoned hot dogs with the tasty toppings. (like the Mango Habenera)I came here the other day for a hot dog fix only to find a sign on the door "Kitchen Closed"  and found out it's CLOSED ...for good.  The new owner was there and he came out to talk to me. Said he'll reopen in a few weeks.  New restaurant, new look, new menu ..it will include French cuisine!
5	Love this place food is good and owners are nice. Give these folks a try everyone. I think they tromp Pink's Hot Dogs
3	I had high hopes for this place but left a little disappointed. The menu is simple, hot dogs or ice cream. No option for polish sausage or brats. I ordered two dogs and after I was done I was left wanting something more. I do have to say though the waffle ice cream sandwich was a great idea. Definitely worth going just for that!
