5	I love getting my hair cut by Jackie! I always leave looking and feeling great about my new cut.  Can't wait for my next appointment!
5	Jackie is the only person I trust with my hair color in the Valley - unfortunately, it took me years to find her! She always gets the color perfect (I'm blonde) and she takes the time to truly identify the best style and shape for your face. I highly recommend her!
1	RUN RUN RUN as fast as you can from this girl!!  "Hue Goddess"??? What a complete joke.  $90 for color that lasts 2 weeks at best.  I have thick hair so we put a straightening solution on the back and it  was great until next haircut when she literally CHOPPED all my hair off in the back.  Again, $80 down the drain.  Her solution for fixing the color is to pawn you off on another inept stylist.  One star is too much.
