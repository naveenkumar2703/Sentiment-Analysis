5	Sunny Landscaping was referred to us by a family member who had his backyard done. We liked what we saw so we decided to give them a call and get a quote to put pavers in our backyard. Helio came out and gave us a reasonable quote. We put our trust in him to deliver exactly what we wanted. Up to that point we had encountered our fair share of unacceptable services in fixing our home. Boy, did Helio deliver. I was shocked at how fast the work was done and by how great it looked. For once, I didn't have to ask for things to get redone because it was wrong. We will be using sunny landscaping to improve our front yard in our new home.
2	Called them 4 times and left 4 messages. No return calls!! At least call me back and tell me you guys are very buzy. That tells me if I had any problems they won't call me back anyways. Very disappointed!
4	Helio and his team are amazing! Great work. Pavers are their specialty, but they do regular landscaping work, too. They just don't do maintenance. The only downfall is he rarely answers his phone because he is busy working with his crew, but you can text him and he responds within the day.
