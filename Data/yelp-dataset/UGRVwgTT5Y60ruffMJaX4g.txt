3	A convenient location on Pinnacle Peak near Pima. They also have a General Store, Post Office and restaurant attached to the same building.
3	Gas is more expensive here than most stations. It is one of the few fill em ups in North Scottsdale. Also has the stinky diesel nozzle if that is how you roll.
4	This gas station is virtually invisible at night.  Unless you live in the area and know where it's located, you'll never find it driving down Pima Rd.  We were on fumes and needed gas desperately.  Thank God for Google Maps...it told us that this place was less than a block away.  I didn't see it until we were right up on it.  I guess the area residents don't like large, well-lit signs....The lanes are wide here, but the gas isn't cheap.  But what do you expect for a gas station in the middle of nowhere?  It's your only choice.There's a general store available here as well, but we didn't have a need for anything in there.  The pumps are well lit at night, so we felt safe.Return Factor - 75%
