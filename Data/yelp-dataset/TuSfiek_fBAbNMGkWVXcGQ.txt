5	Jager, my 6 year old bull terrier, has been seeing Dr. Allen since he was 10 weeks old. She is nothing short of wonderful. In fact, the entire staff is comprised of the most compassionate people I've ever met, and they truly care about my dog. Over his 6 years, mischievous Jager has gotten himself into some pretty precarious situations (run-ins with cacti, frolicking in broken glass and, of course,  attempting to digest shoes and socks). The folks at Indian Bend Animal Hospital always make him good as new, with as little pain (and expense) as possible.The cost is much more reasonable than other similar facilities in the area. As a full-time working single [dog] parent, I really appreciate that they are open on Wednesdays from 4pm to 8 pm. Dr. Allen has always been patient, even with an annoying first-time dog owner such as myself. I can't imagine trusting his care to anyone else.
5	The doctors and techs at this hospital bar none have been the most caring and compassionate vet I have ever experienced . My dog swallowed the end of a rawhide bone yesterday and I rushed her there hysterical of course. They gave her immediate attention and saved her life . That let me sit with her as she woke up from sedation and also stayed with us as she came to. Dr.Isom was right by our side and couldn't have been more comforting through my hysterical crying. After all was said and done I returned home so grateful with my girl Jazzy. Thank you Indian Bend
5	Dr. Allen is wonderful.  I cant say enough good things about her and this office.  Staff is awesome, too!  I had been to 3 or 4 vet offices before finding her.  I wish I found her sooner!
