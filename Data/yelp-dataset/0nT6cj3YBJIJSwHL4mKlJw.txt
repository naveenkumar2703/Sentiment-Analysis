3	This is a modest eatery found inside the Phoenix Oriental Market. The menu is short - basic pho, rice, and noodle dishes ranging in price from about 5 to 8 bucks. The big bowl of steaming hot pho is tasty and well-flavored with aromatic herbs and comes with the usual side plate of mint and crunchy fresh bean sprouts. The dining space itself is a simple no-frills area, partly open and surrounded by the fresh and refrigerated produce section of the Asian food market.
3	This place is just OK.  The Pho there is OK, nothing exciting honestly.  I've only been to a few pho places but this one is probably at the bottom (not saying that it's bad though.....just comparing).  The place is very clean.  The pho is served in a bowl that's too small to be honest, I didn't have any room to put the bean sprouts in without it seeming like it would overflow the bowl. The fried rice is...well....average at most.  I wasn't the biggest fan, but once again...wasn't awful, i've just had better.Lastly I had thai tea boba.  A bit too sweet for my taste, with not enough boba (which they also "accidentally" overcharged me for (they fixed the problem).  I looked over my bill and things didn't really add up...it seemed as if certain things were more expensive than i recall seeing on the menu.Nonetheless, I probably wont come back here, but I guess it's worth a shot for curious restaurant goers.
