5	Excellent food.  Very good service.  Indoor and patio seating, but it can get chilly at night.  Very nice place for an upscale dinner, either with a group or on a date.  They have an excellent selection, and a very good wine list.
3	I only went to this place once in all the years I lived in Scottsdale, and that was only because my neighbor knew the owners. I was kind of surprised that the really only impressive part of the experience was the building it was in. I personally have a hard time paying a lot of money for Italian food in general, because it generally costs me very little to make myself. Anyhow, the food is okay but for the price I don't understand what the big deal is.
3	Had reservations at eight pm on a Friday but you'd probably be ok without them. Sat outside, nice atmosphere, linen table cloths etc. Service was prompt at fairly attentive. Beard basket served w oil and Vinegar was good. Shared a Caesar salad which was excellent. Ordered angel hair bolognese for the entree and shared that also. One of us loved it, but I really didn't care for the sauce.   Meal was reasonably priced, but if you're not sharing be prepared to spend about $80. Best iced tea ever!! They show you the dessert options so make sure you can overcome the temptation! We enjoyed it overall and would return after trying a few others in the area.
