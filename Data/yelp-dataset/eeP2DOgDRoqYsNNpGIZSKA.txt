5	This is the best ham radio store in town! Everyone there is very helpfull and the prices you can't beat! If you are a ham and visiting, visit this place! Not far off the Strip - just the other side of the freeway from the strip.
5	Excellent prices and selection.  I can't comment too much on the knowledge level of the sales staff as I knew exactly what I wanted to purchase.  However, the sales staff was exceptionally friendly and efficient, which made for an excellent shopping experience.I highly recommend this store for all of your radio hobby needs.
4	I like shopping AES and have bought two Yaesu radios from them.  I was in Las Vegas and dropped by the store.   I was hoping to see radios on display to try and get a hands on feel of.  But, a limited selection of radios behind the counter beyond touch and not connected.  So, I'll shop their catalog but pass the in store visit unless I know exactly what I need!Nice store just no radios to demo.
3	One reviewer states that this is the best Ham store in town; please tell me the other ones, because I didn't find any others at all.  Radio World in Boulder City is 100x better.I stopped in and it was all the same ham gear you can get (and research) online.  I didn't see any sale items, or anything that compels me to shop in a brick-and-mortar store.   I've been to the AES in Milwaukee also and that one was a little better.It's fine, but nothing to write home about.
