5	One question: Do you like/love baklava? If you answered with a yes, then you must visit this place. They have a huge assortment of freshly baked baklava and other middle eastern sweets. We asked them too fill a plate for us with a selection of different baklava to take home. They all taste wonderful and I'm so glad we found this place.
5	Wow! Walked in to check this place out. They have an assortment of middle eastern pastries. They gave me about 5 to try for free. So good!!!They are opening a buffet later this week. Will have to check that out too. Highly recommend this place
