5	YUM!Cafe Crepes is exactly the sort of place that websites like this are made for! It is such a hidden gem! The crepes here are as good as any I've ever had  - and I just got back from Paris! You can make your own combination from around 30 fillings, savoury or sweet and a heap of different sauces to play around with. Following a friends recommendation, I got spicy sausage, herb sauce and marscapone and I can thoroughly recommend it to you! It was really big and you watch it being made, like a posh subway!If crepes aren't your thing (then you're weird), then they also do great bacon and egg rolls.You'll be able to tell from the picture, but Cafe Crepes is really quite small and so sacrificed seating! But Bruntsfield is a nice place with lots of benches! Or munch on your way to work/uni. Yes you might look a bit silly, but you'll forget all about it after the first bite.
5	I totally agree with Emily, Cafe Crepe is definitely a hidden gem and I'm so surprised it doesn't have more reviews - it's amazing! Definitely the best crepes you'll find anywhere in Edinburgh. I love watching crepes being made, one minute their a watery gloop and the next a delicious crepe, it's like magic!They have an amazing range and whether you're after sweet or savoury there will be something to cater for every taste bud here. I'm more of a savoury person to be honest and always struggle whether or not to go for a vegetable one or one with meat through it, it's a hard life.
5	It looks like a clean sweep of top scores for Cafe Crepe, as I certainly can't fault it. Tasty as crepes are, they're often surprisingly hard to find, but usually worth it.I usually just go for a nutella-filled classic version. I feel sick by the end of it, but strangely happy.
