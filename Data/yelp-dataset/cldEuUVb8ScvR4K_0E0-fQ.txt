1	we were disappointed with our cooking class for cuban food. the ad and online class description had no mention of pork, only jerk plantain and black bean dish, so it was to our dismay when we arrived and there were no black beans, only pork! so we couldn't really even eat. we cooked the pork and gave it to a classmate. and even the plantains....like eating dried out cornbread. absolutely no taste. i thought it was just me because i'm not really a good cook, but our other classmates had the same complaint. i didn't find this experience very educational at all. it was in a non-descript kitchen prep/cook warehouse way the hell out in the west valley. luckily and with good business sense, the organizer agreed to refund our price because the advertisement was misleading. we probably won't do this again. maybe you'll have better luck.
5	I was really pleased with the private cooking class I had in my home.The Cajun Chicken Linguini was delicious! The recipe wasn't something I would normally attempt, but it turned out really good the night of the class and I was able to make it just as good later on- quite an accomplishment for someone who burns mac and cheese, trust me. I definitely walked away with some good knowledge..I had 8 guests and everyone had a really fun time. I thought Hannah did a good job at directing and instructing the class while keeping everything really laid back. I didn't even have to supply any of my own dishes or pans or anything, she brought everything and took care of all the dirty dishes. Overall, I thought it was a really fun night and well worth the $35 a person we would have spent going out. I definitely recommend it!
