3	I'm a Panda Express fan and I've eaten at the Primm Buffalo Bill location on many occasions.  It's fine.  It's mostly like any other Panda, except this location, like mall locations, doesn't have the fresh brewed China MIst iced tea, which is the best iced tea that I've had at any fast food locations.  Also, no free refills  =(The food is pretty much the same, although it seems like the rice and noodles are a little more greasy and tired looking than at my Panda.  I'll keep eating there, but it's not my favorite Panda Express location.
1	I love panda express but NEVER in my life have I experienced FOOD POISONING! Bought honey walnut shrimp and beef and broccoli with a side of fried rice. Food tasted like it had been sitting there for a while. Literally 45 minutes after eating started feeling queasy and nauseous, then BOOM! Been stuck in the hotel room ever since yesterday! I'm upstairs! Right now! cuz of that stupid motherf*#!ing squalor Buffalo Bills calls a "restaurant". Had to post asap to forewarn other visitors. & the sad part is that I'm a frequent buffalo bills/ primm guest :( I'm so disappointed right now. I'm not saying panda express is a bad place to get food but STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!
1	After waiting in line for 15 minutes...get to the front only to find out they've run out of food...but they didn't tell anyone in line...so dumb. At least have the courtesy to make an announcement to the crowd when there's a line 20 people deep.Ridiculous.
