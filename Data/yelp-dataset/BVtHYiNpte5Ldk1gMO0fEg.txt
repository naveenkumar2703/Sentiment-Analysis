3	This will be short and sweet. These folks will dish you out some Japanese food in a hurry... and for cheap.Even my vegetarian friend found something to eat.
4	Friend and I discovered Suki Hana over a year ago and I have been addicted to their pepper chicken ever since!!! I have tried to recreate it at home and just never comes out the same. I have tried their other items, but it's the pepper chicken that I want.  Its chicken, onions, jalapenos cooked in perfect harmony! It's a great place for a fast quick lunch down at Az Mills Mall. Yea I'll be back lol.
1	Trapped in Arizona Mills during a drawn-out shopping experience, I had no choice but to make a beeline to the Food Court for some long-overdue sustenance. I chose Suki Hana because I wanted something with seafood in it, and they offer shrimp stir-fry along with other entrees.I was mistakenly under the impression that since this was Japanese cuisine, it was less likely to be greasy than Chinese fast food. Not only is the food a bit on the oily side, but the chicken stir-fry dish contains chicken meat that should've been trimmed better of the tendons, fat, and connective tissue. I spent some time pulling apart the chicken to remove the largely inedible parts.It's not the most unappetizing fast-food experience I've had. The food here satisfied my hunger pangs and kept me going so that I could complete the endless march to traverse the Arizona Mills rotunda (honestly... they could've added one central corridor to avoid having to complete the entire circuit every time). However, if you need a change of pace and some greasy chicken with noodles and rice, you've found your Food Court vendor here.
5	Great portion for lunch. Sesame chicken is great! I am so love the tomato salad!
3	Tried their chicken and shrimp lunch special. Typical chinese fast food, nothing special. But the food tasted good and it was worth the buck.
