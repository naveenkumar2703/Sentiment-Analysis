4	I didn't think the Tempe Historical Museum would be that interesting. After all, let's face it, Tempe isn't that interesting. Yet, through dioramas, photographs, and filmed recreations, the museum does an excellent job of relating the story of Tempe and the various battles over land, water, and development the city has faced. OK, the movies are a little forced. You know the kind of films where people talk about current events as if they were talking to complete imbeciles. It would be like if today I said, "Hey Joe, you hear about the war in Iraq?"But maybe I'm the only one that kind of stuff really bothers. And aside from those moments, I was really interested in the exhibits here. It really does a good job at explaining how Tempe changed and became what it is today. Most local museums I find trying, but this one put forth a really good effort. For the free admission, it can't hurt to spend half-an-hour to learn a little about the local history.
