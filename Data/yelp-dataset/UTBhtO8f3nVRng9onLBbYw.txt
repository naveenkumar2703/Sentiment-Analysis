5	I have been seeing chiropractors since the 1980's and probably been adjusted by at least 15 different ones in different towns. Dr. Grimes is a very good adjuster, not rough. I highly recommend seeing him for you or your family. It is great to see a doctor who also treats kids, who like going there and don't come out crying.
5	Dr. Grimes and his staff are helpful and friendly.  I don't know about you, but I can't stand going to a doctor's office and waiting for an hour or more just to get back into a waiting room to wait for the doctor but this is not how Dr Grimes' office operates. No long waits! I highly recommend Dr G to anyone who has neck or back pain from normal wear and tear or car accidents. Dr G listens and he gets results!
5	I have been going to Dr. John Grimes for over  10 years. I have been adjusted by many.    The reason I have been so loyal are many.  First of which he does not make you wait longer than 5 minutes to begin your appointment.  The staff is is knowledgeable and friendly  and have been with Dr. Grimes for years.  He truly believes in a healthy life style and if interested in truly being healthy and are  discipline, Dr Grimes will show you the way. He takes insurance and has plans for cash too.  He takes an interest in my life.  Its healthy fun and I look forward to being adjusted.  You owe it to yourself to make an appointment and see for your self.  You will be happy you did and so will your body.
