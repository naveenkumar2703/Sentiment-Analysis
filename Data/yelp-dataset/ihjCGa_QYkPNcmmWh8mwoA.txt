5	Awesomeness.He runs his tailoring business out of the backroom of his very nice house.I love him.He makes my super fancy jeans look great, even though I'm 5'4", and he will reattach the original bottoms if requested.
5	I had Cameron tailor 2 LBM 1911 jackets and he did an outstanding job. Cameron is incredibly friendly and has a true appreciation and respect for quality clothing.He also is capable of making custom suiting and shirting at reasonable prices. If you bring him your best fitting shirt/suit/pants he can replicate the fit and use whatever materials you want. I did notice some of his shirting fabric samples and they included Thomas Mason.Highly recommended!
5	Great service, perfect quality, fast, and hassle-free. This is the place I trust to alter my clothes.Sometimes he does work while I wait and watch TV, which compared to most tailors, is lightning-fast.
