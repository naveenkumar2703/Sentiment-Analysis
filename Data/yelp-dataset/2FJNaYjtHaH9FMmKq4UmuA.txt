4	I purchased my first pair of authentic cowboy boots here!  I walked in and was welcomed by the smell of good leather.  At first I thought I may have been out of my league as I passed by $1500 mens boots, but I breathed a sigh of relief as I perused through the womens department.  Needless to say , they have a boot to fit your budget.There was one lady tending the register,  and many of us in the store.  When she was available, she made sure she answered any questions that I had.In the end, I  walked away with a sweet pair of Mahogany red/brown Tony Lama cowboy boots.
