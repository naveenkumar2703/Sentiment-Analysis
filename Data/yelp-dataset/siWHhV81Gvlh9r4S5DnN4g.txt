3	I'll be upfront. I don't go shopping for beads. I am not "into" beading. I am just -- and I mean just -- getting started in making jewelry. That is, I have ordered some supplies and a book. But they haven't arrived yet. Not only that, I am leaning more toward wire-wrapping than beading.Nonetheless, I had a few minutes before my personal trainer appointment next door. So I thought I'd come in and check it out. For a relatively small shop, they certainly do have a whole heckuva a lot of beads. I pawed through several of the itty bitty containers, and found several beads and charms that made me think I might want to make something out of them.  I also noticed they offered some reasonably-priced classes.So there you go, West Side beaders. Check 'em out.
1	Now that I have a little more experience in jewelry making and bead shopping, I can say that A 2 Z isn't all that. Every time I go, they don't have what I'm looking for. Not only that, they watch me, as if I'm trying to steal something.
4	This store closed a few months ago, unfortunately!!!
