5	Best of the best .....
1	Super disappointed in my tattoo from seige, not only the work, but the manner in which I was treated when I called back to discuss concerns. . Not only was he completely snobby and rude. He absolutely in no way will take responsibility for giving me a half ass job in something I have to live forever with,  because I was "difficult and adamant" on colors he didn't think would work.  All the time i thought I'm being helpful and clear.. He is the most cocky and insensitive "artist" I have ever encountered.  I'm totally bummed that he is unwilling to even touch up the piece of crap job he did on my arm and blames my one day use of sunblock as the culprit to his missing chunks of color, scaring,  and total mess of shading. . Granted it was a job already started by another artist,  but I figured if he really hated to do my idea so much he would have passed like a true professional instead of pocketing my money and blaming the bad job in my color choices and refusing to try and help fix it!!! Terrible customer service, communications skills and work ethics if you ask me.  Not to mention he had a stick up his ass the entire session. . Lame!!!!!!!!!
5	Revival Art collective is the place to go for top notch art work for both you body and your walls! Siege is a super talented artist who listens to your opinion and reflects back with his own. The gallery is one of kind, nothing like it in the valley! The special events are on point. I suggest it to everyone!
5	Siege is amazing at what he does. Truly a class act. If you looking for someone who cares about what he's putting on your body look no further. Exceeded all of my expectations in every way possible. Can't wait to get back in there and get another piece of artwork on my body.
5	This studio is a beautiful and innovative example of local artistry and community. Every month they showcase a new local artist and hold a reception in their honor. Everyone they've had has been a beautiful representation of Arizona's creative minds. The resident artist is Siege, who sees tattoos as art and treats them as such. His work is consistently breathtaking and never fails to amaze. If you'd like to pick flash out of a book for your tramp stamp, go down the street. If you'd like a custom, one of a kind piece for your collection, this is your place.
