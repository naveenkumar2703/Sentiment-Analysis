3	Convenient little Chase bank close to the strip, esp if you wanna get tagged with a $5 surcharge on your ATM card in the casino.  One of the ATM machines weren't working when we were there, so it took a little longer than expected, but we were still in and out in about 5 minutes.
4	Very helpful and friendly. If you are in the military or a veteran they go above and beyond to help you out. Because I am a veteran, they upgraded my account.
4	Stopped in to get some more money, which while in Vegas might imply we've gone through lots of money already but we've still only spent under$100 between two people and it's day 3, so we're doing alright. Just wanted more cash for tips and the like. This Chase was easy to find and not far from the main strip. Easy parking lot to get in and out of and up-close parking. ATMs in a front area but we went into the branch and were greeted by two friendly employees.I made some coffee while husband completed the financial transaction stuff. And then in only a few minutes, we were off for more adventures with money in our pockets again. Thanks, Chase!
2	I don't bank at Chase.  But my brother does.  He needed to go the bank, and this branch was the closest one he found from strip.  So, as an convenience, this is the place to head for Chase customers.  Problem is that the line moved slow and the parking was not so good.
2	Painfully slow service. Waited in line for 30 minutes. Maybe they are just short staffed. Looks like the manager is just walking around instead of helping people. Next time I'm in town I'm going to a different branch.
