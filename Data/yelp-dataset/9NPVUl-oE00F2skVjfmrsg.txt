5	If your craving some good ol home cooked soul food then contact Sophia or Curtis over at A Taste of Heaven! They are a small locally owned catering business that serves a mix of soul food and caribbean cuisine. Sophia is from Jamaica and Curtis grew up cooking soul food so they combined their specialties and bam! A Taste of Heaven was born. I work with Sophia at EDMC and her families catering company comes in and serves the entire company lunch twice a week(Tuesdays and Thursdays). The ribs and mac cheese are my favorite. Curtis has got a rib sauce that doesn't disappoint! And THE GREENS are AMAZING! Anyways, if you want them to come and cater your event or at your place of business, hit em up! You'll be happy you did.
5	I am having ATOH withdrawals.I used to work for a company in Phoenix that used lunch vendors, and these guys were one of the vendors. Holy. Crap. Everyone is so, so nice. Best meatloaf I've ever had, mashed potatoes were amazing, I could eat their cornbread muffins all day, and I ate their mac and cheese on the regular. (This is coming from a girl who detests mac and cheese, but these guys do it RIGHT...homemade, NOT any shade of bright orange, just delicious, amazing, melt-in-your-mouth mac and cheese.) I have been trying to come up with an excuse to hire them to cater something, ANYTHING, because the food is so amazing. After-Christmas festivity? Dog's birthday party? I'll come up with something, because this food is FANTASTIC.
