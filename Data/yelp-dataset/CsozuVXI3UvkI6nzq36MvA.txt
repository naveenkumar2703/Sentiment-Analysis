5	So, my wife and I stumbled on to this UPS Store because they were featured on Groupon with a deal.  So we bought it, and went in to send some Christmas gifts out.  Once we got in there, we met the owners, this older husband and wife team.  They were really great, super helpful and funny.  We would definitely go back for any UPS shipping we have to do.
5	This husband and wife run business is flawless in operation. I send a package out at least once a month and their customer service combined with their meticulous execution are commendable. In addition, they partnered up with a photo to canvas conversion that is definitely worth trying.Pros: perfect service, no lines, neighborhood feelCons: I just wish they were open on Sunday
2	Wow, I really liked the folks here, and they did pack my item well. However, the international shipment I was sending was based on size and not weight, the box they chose would have cost me and extra 250.00 in shipping had I not taken the package home cut the box down and repacked it.
4	Nice little shop. They are very small and located in the same parking lot as the Fedex store, We were looking for a notary and first stopped at Fedex Store, but they unfortunately didn't have a notary on duty. I looked at my trusty Yelp app and was happy to find the UPS store wasn't too far away. The lady who worked there was really friendly and helpful, making sure we filled out everything we needed before completing her notary services. $5 and 5 minutes later we were out the door and ready to finish the rest of our errands for the day. Looks good for shipping needs as well. We'll have to check it out again if we're every in need.
