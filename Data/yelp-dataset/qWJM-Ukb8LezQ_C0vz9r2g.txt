5	Hal is a Notre Dame grad, but I still think he is great!  He runs a solo office, has been practicing for 40+ years, and knows his business well.  He has helped me with business entity and our personal estate plan.  His fees are reasonable and reflect that fact that he has low overhead and no large corporate entity to support!  If he cannot help you he can point you in the right direction.
5	Hal is a business law professional.He is a really nice guy too, who takes the time to help you really understand an issue from top to bottom. It is obvious Hal loves the law and is more interested in justice than your wallet.Hal specializes in helping you to form and protect a business or idea. He also does living wills and estate planning.
5	Hal is a great guy, very down to earth, and very knowledgeable. I would recommend him to anyone I know.
5	As a residential Realtor, we often recommend that our clients meet with an attorney prior to making any decisions that might affect  their assets, their will, their estate, or anything else of the like.  In this market, particularly, I recommend that anyone considering a short sale or foreclosure speak with an attorney.  My first recommendation has always been and will always be Hal Bliss.  He is exceptionally knowledgeable and very thorough.And best of all, as someone who refers clients to him, I always hear positive reviews back from my clients who decided to hired him.
5	Hal Bliss is an incredible attorney!  We would not say that about anyone unless it was 100% true!  Right now short sales are a huge part of the real estate market and they are extremely complex.  We have sought the assistance of Hal Bliss on a number of occasions and his advice has always been spot on for our clients.  He has been able to help many of them through what is one of the most challenging real estate transactions with ease and calm.  He just helped two of our mutual clients successfully through this maze.  They closed escrow yesterday! Thank you, Hal!
