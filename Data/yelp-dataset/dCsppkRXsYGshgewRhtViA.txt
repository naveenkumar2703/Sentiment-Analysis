5	How lucky are we?  We get to live in Las Vegas and have a nice, mild winter and then whenever the mood strikes us to have some cooler temps, all we have to do is take a short drive up to Mt Charleston!I've been visiting Mt Charleston ever since I moved to Vegas.  Being a Pittsburgh girl, I occasionally get the calling for some evergreen trees and cool air.  Mount Charleston is easy to get to and the drive is unbelievable.  It's amazing to watch how much more vegetation appears on landscape as you make your way up in elevation.  Once you get to the top, you have a gorgeous pine forest to admire.Spring Mountain National Rec Area (what I incorrectly consider "Mt Charleston") is nice for the drive alone.  There are plenty of pull-outs for photos on the road between Kyle Canyon and Lee Canyon.  It's a nice spot to visit for the afternoon to have a picnic and get some fresh air.  There is also plenty of hiking if you want to get outdoors but don't want to pass out from the 110 degree weather down in the valley.If you ever decide you need to see some snow, Mt Charleston has that for you as well.  I was up there hiking in May a couple years ago and there were still piles of snow 5 feet high in some places on the trail!  For those of you that like you have your "White Christmas," then you should definitely consider getting a room at the resort or lodge in December.  Oh, and did I mention there was skiing in Lee Canyon?I love it here and don't visit nearly as often as I should.  If you're a tourist and you are looking for something different to do while visiting Vegas, you might want to consider this.  If you are from Las Vegas and never been, then get your butt in gear and get up to the mountain!  Your body will thank you for the few hours it's not melting in the sun.

4	Great place in the summer to get away from the Las Vegas heat.Tons of great well marked hiking trails to be had, for all fitness levels. Make a stop at the Visitors Center and grab yourself a free trails map or just google it. If you go in the spring time there will be more opportunities to see waterfalls or streams like on the Mary Jane Falls trails and Big Falls.Take your lunch and eat at one of the many picnic areas or stop by the Mount Charleston Resort and have a bite.You can even camp up there and make a weekend of it. Plenty of wildlife can be seen at all times of the day.It's a short drive from Las Vegas so don't hesitate, before you know it, it'll be covered with snow!
4	I love this whole area! I always come here when I'm in Vegas. Very pretty.
4	We have done the scenic driving loop on numerous occasions in the past, but not in recent years.  The highlight of our drive was spotting a herd of 9 wild horses grazing in a meadow on our way up to Kyle Canyon.  As we began the start of the return leg, just before the Resort on Mount Charleston, we saw noticed the trees and shrubs were ablaze in brilliant yellows and golds.
5	Spring Mountain National Recreation Area is a very generic term as there's so much that that title covers.There's hiking trails, picnic areas, motels, restaurants, skiing, mountain biking, camping....if you enjoy the outdoors there's literally something for everyone here.If you can't find something enjoyable to do up here you've got a problem.
5	Over the past year I've realized I really need to appreciate the outdoors around me more. I've gotten out of the city on quite a few occasions lately and I've taken a liking to hiking, even though I am not particularly good at it. This area outside of Vegas is primarily known for being the home of Mt. Charleston. The thing to realize though, is that there's much more to do here than go to Mt. Charleston.On mine and my husband's last venture here we brought our two dogs to go on the North loop hike. This hike is located in the Kyle Canyon area. It's a nice hike, and I love the views you can get as you make each summit. It is up, up, up most of the way, but there are a few areas that allow hikers (like myself) a few moments of ease and the ability to catch your breathe. I love the feeling of coming up into the mountains from the valley. It's really just a totally different world. Honestly if you are not coming out here every once and awhile you are doing yourself a disservice just stewing in the Vegas valley.Give your lungs some fresh mountain air, give your nose new smells - pine, wildlife, clean air! And give your legs some room to move! There's just nothing like this in the city. You have to get out there and live it.
5	The Spring Mountain National Recreation Area is generally regarded as the area around Kyle and Lee Canyons.  The recreation area allows many things that you wouldn't expect in the Las Vegas area.  There's skiing and snowboarding in the winter, snowshoe trips in the winter, hiking in the summer, and lots and lots of trees.  While it's still desert, the mountains get much more rain, relatively speaking, than does Las Vegas and thus the lush nature of the mountains.I visit the mountain in various times of the year but mostly in the summer for hiking.  There are many trails.  The hiking can be difficult for many because of the elevation.  There are few trails that start at less than 7,500 feet so you may be gasping to catch your breath and stopping more often than for a normal hike.In the summer, on weekends, you can ride the chairlift to the top of the ski area and walk back down, ride back down, or enjoy a game of Frisbee golf as you make your way down the run.  If you're lucky, you can see some of Nevada's wild horses as they roam free in the Spring Mountains.*************************************************************A couple of things to remember about the Recreation Area in 2014.*************************************************************Due to the Carpenter 1 Fire of 2013, there are several trails and areas that are closed.  These are the Cathedral Rock Trail, the South Loop Trail, the Little Falls Trail, and the Echo Trail.  Fines for hiking in the fire burned area can be as high as $5,000.  It is a federal offense.  Don't be a jerk and hike through the burn area.  You're just impeding the regrowth of the forest and you'll be harming the ecology.  Be a smart user of our shared resources!Stay out of those areas and you still have a large part of the Recreation Area to explore and use--Lee Canyon and the trails of Deer Creek Road.  These are still open.  Use them.
5	This is the PERFECT getaway from the Vegas city life! I can't believe this place exists only 45 minutes from Las Vegas. I am a huge fan of pine nuts.  For those that buy pine nuts, we all know that it costs $30/lb at Whole Foods.  Here's a secret... Pinyon pine trees grows here!  "Annually between September and November, the Forest Service allows one pound of shelled nuts or ten pounds of cones to be collected per family within the National Recreation Area. No permit or fee is required to gather for personal use."  How amazing is this?  FREE pine nuts! I went to harvest pine nuts in late October and there were PLENTY.
1	Where the hell is this place? We drove there and around it, and is was a parking lot. Are you kidding me? All the pictures described on this website was not seen. It was frustrating. If I could give it a zero star, I would.
