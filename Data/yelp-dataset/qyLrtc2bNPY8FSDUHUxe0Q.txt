5	Dr. Lawyer is a fantastic doctor.  He spends time with me and makes sure my lenses are perfect!The office support staff are welcoming, friendly, and efficient.  I have been a patient for more than ten years, I highly recommend Dr.Lawyer.
5	The office staff is warm, friendly and efficient!  All together I was in and out of the office in about 30 minutes.Dr. Lawyer himself is great.  He greeted me with a "so what's up?", which I found funny and actually quite comforting.  He cracked jokes along the way, but still maintained his professionalism.  Some people may be a little put off by this but I think it adds to the "experience", if you would call it that.  Just lighten up and go with it!The prescriptions they write here are good for two years, which is nice.  So even though it won't be any time soon, I will definitely be back.
