5	Aloha Las Vegas Yelpers!!! Happy 2011!I've been living in LV for a month now and I was excited to find me a new church home.I attended New Hope of Hilo (Big Island,Hawaii) years ago when I lived in Hilo and I decided to do a little research to see if there was a branch here in Vegas... after a minute of searching online, I found Las Vegas New Hope :DI've been going the last 2 Sundays and plan on going every Sunday.They have a 9am and 11am Sunday Morning service.Everyone at the church is really nice and most of the members are from Hawaii. Pastor Kent Miyoshi from Oahu/Hawaii is a really down to earth pastor, super friendly and always welcoming. The praise and worship team is great.So if you're looking for a Christian church with a touch of Aloha... New Hope Las Vegas is the place to be on Sunday mornings!They also have a youth, men and women ministry! So there's something for everyone. Bring your bible, sing a little, pray, fellowship with your brothers and sisters in Christ and give thanks to God!Come as you are.God is Good... All the time! All the time... God is Good!Amen!See you in church!-Miss Yelp 2011
5	That's my Church!!!!  Cheehoo!Having grown up in Hawaii, I attended New Hope at Farrington High School for a little bit and then Windward New Hope at Castle High School a little before moving here to Las Vegas, and found New Hope Las Vegas back in 2003. I started attending again a little before they found themselves a new home here at The River. I am so glad I found a new home for church!!
5	I love this church because it reminds me of home.  If you are from Hawaii and have been looking for a church that has the same warmth and love as New Hope Christian Fellowship on O'ahu, you will be "home" at New Hope Las Vegas.
