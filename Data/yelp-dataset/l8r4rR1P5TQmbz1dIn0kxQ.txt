4	I have been shopping at this Safeway for a few months now, and its not so bad.  Since I have started shopping there since last summer, things have improved!  They did a remodel at the end of the year and it looks a lot better then it did before.This store is an older Safeway...not the coolest or newest one I have been in, but nice enough that I like it and feel comfortable shopping here.  They have most everything you would need for one stop shopping..the usual Safeway Deli, meat counter, pharmacy and a nice selection of food and other stuff.I gave it 4 stars becuase A) they recently remodeled and B) they have a clean store!
4	I ran into to buy some plants only.  The lady running the flowers/plants was so nice and helpful.  She told me which flowers just came in, which ones on sale, etc.  I picked out 4 plants and they were so vibrate in color.  To top it off, they were on sale.  Loved it!
4	I like this store. Most of the time they have something on sale or at a good price. I find that the meat selection is good and almost priced lower than Wal-Mart! They need to have more slabs of pork ribs. I have to go to Frys for that.
4	Not a bad supermarket. I've shopped there and have walked out happy every time.
4	This Safeway is fantastic because it is open way past most grocery stores in the area. They usually have everything I need and their coupon policy is great! The lines are fast and the people are very nice! I always go there now, I refuse to go anywhere else.
