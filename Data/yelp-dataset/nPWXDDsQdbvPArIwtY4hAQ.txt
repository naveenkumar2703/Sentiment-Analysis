3	Wendy's is a bit of alright if you're looking for a bacon roll rustled up quick sharp in the morning.They serve a number of different foods, from fast food offerings and fry up's to healthier options such as baked potatoes. While I can't comment on the latter, I have certainly stopped by here a few times over the years for a hangover cure roll, and they've always been awesome. I had a friend who used to stay in this end of town and not only was her flat easier to budget than if she'd moved up to Bruntsfield, but the cafe's were conveniently cheaper all around! There is no room for complaint when you're experiencing a gorgeous filled roll for a tiny price.Wendy's is no exception - even the more modern, continental baguettes weren't breaking the bank - but I prefer this kind of place for a good old fashioned fry up. They've been servicing the community for over 40 years and arguably The Great British Fry is their best area. Their pies are pretty sweet, too - especially on a match day if you're heading off to the local stadium!
