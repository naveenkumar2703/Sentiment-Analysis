5	The Firehouse is a multifaceted artspace in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  Located just north of Roosevelt, the Firehouse is a great place to visit as part of your First Friday artwalk experience.  There is an art gallery, cafe, stage which hosts all kinds of entertainment, and resident artists studios.  Hours are Fridays 6-11, Saturdays 1-11 and Sundays 1-6
4	We saw a theater piece 'Shame Photography' featuring a very talented young performance artist Friday night.The theater space is outdoors next to the cafe.  You pay what you wish as a donation for the beverages.It's all very 'east village' circa '60s funky, but the collective members know production values.Provided you're not expecting Scottsdale Center ambiance the theater and other readings are well done, serious material.
4	Part art gallery, part performance venue, part First Friday hangout, and part domicile, The Firehouse is one of those places my family visits about five or six times per year.  My wife used to be part of the music scene in Phoenix during the 1990s and she knows some of the people who work and perform here.  It's a large place, with many twists and turns, items for sale, and pieces of art on the walls.  There's also a place in the back that can accommodate small poetry and music performances, as well as meetings or whatever you can get a group of independently-minded people to get together to do.Fun? Absolutely, if this is your scene.  I used to visit places like this in Berkeley when I was in my 20s and 30s.  Always colorful personalities stopping by.  If this sounds like coolness to you and you have never been here, by all means pay this place a visit on the next First Friday.
5	The Firehouse Gallery is a place for local artists, musicians and everyone else to enjoy, form community and spread the positive vibe that is alive in Phoenix, AZ. See for yourself, there is magick in the air at the Firehouse Gallery.
