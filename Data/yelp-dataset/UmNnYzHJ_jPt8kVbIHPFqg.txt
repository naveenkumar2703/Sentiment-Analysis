4	This is a great place to get supplies for seed starting, seeds, garden tools and supplies. They have a few organic fertilizer options but not as many as a few other places in town. Most of their seeds are their own line which is reasonably priced and grow well. They also have bareroot plants and garden transplants.

If you buy a plant, just be careful to watch out for mealy bugs.  I've had a few plants with bugs and also seen them on some of their stock greenhouse plants.
5	Excellent! I love this place. I had no idea what to expect when I first walked into Jung's. I was wide-eyed and naive...trying to plant a veggie garden for the first time. The gals at the front pointed my boyfriend and I toward the back where we could find what we were looking for. Afterward, we had so many questions!! The gal at the front happily told us everything we could possibly want to know about growing a vegetable garden. She also gave us some good tips on how to get these growing healthy and strong. I definitely give this place two thumbs up!! :)
2	i had heard that this was the place for seed starting suppies thay have alot but no one was around to help me with questions. i know that spring is late in comming to wisconsin but there was only the girl at the register and she said she really doesnt garden. a offer was made to get someone to help but i was running late and could not wait. their prices we good  but the place was really unorganised. i will check out their annuals when it gets warmer.
