1	SORRY SORRY SORRY I went for the All U Can Eat Fried Cod today (Friday) at 5:30pm. At 5:55pm I requested two more pieces of fish. The waitress said they were out. Say what? This is FRIDAY All U Can Eat Fish day? She said but we're out of fish. Then why did you charge me $10.99 twice for two people that DID NOT have ALL the fish U can eat? Damn America! Wake up and quit treating people like their return business doesn't matter.
3	Chicken fried steak, bread pudding... Outstanding!!
1	Not sure how they can do so much advertising and brag about how good their fish/cod is and have it served hard as a rock after being held under a heat lamp for I don't know how long. Terrible.
1	There was a "For Rent" sign on the door as of 7/15/12.
1	Let's just some it up as disgustingly dirty. Nasty all the way around. That explains why they are now out of business.
