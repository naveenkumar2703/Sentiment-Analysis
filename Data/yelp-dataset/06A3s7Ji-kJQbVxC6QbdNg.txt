4	I went there last night with the guys, had a really nice time the music was very chill not the usual all metal crap it was a good mix from rise against to atmosphere to 50 cent......didn't try the hookah although they had a separate area with couches to smoke which looked very nice...also carried arcade games in the back room alongside the 8ft pool tables and the 10ft tables near the counter....had a good time definitely will stop by again sometime.18+
4	I went last night with a buddy of mine, I'm not sure how busy it gets on the weekend, but on a Wednesday night it was really relaxing and quiet. We shot some stick, smoked one of the house mixes for shisha in the Hookah. All in all a great time. We'll see if I head out on a weekend, I'm a little old for the loud pool hall scene these days.
4	Hookah, pool, snacks, and friendly staff.  I wish this place was closer to me, because I would DEFINITELY be a regular.  The guy running it knows his stuff and knows how to treat patrons.  What more do you need?  I was visiting friends and found this place after trying to find somewhere with bellydancers.  No bellydancers were to be had during the time I ended up there, but they may have them on other nights.  It's an interesting venue: industrial feel, but with way comfortable clubby-style seating.  Also their bathroom is REALLY clean.  [Always a bonus!]I'm also not sure if this place is now called "Silver Q" or "Trickshot", but whatever the name, it's a good venue.  Spacious, comfy, fun, and not too loud (unlike some hookah lounges I've been to).  Go!
