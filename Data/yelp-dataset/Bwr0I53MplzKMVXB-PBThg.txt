3	Good selection of snacks.  Convenient gas stop right next to my better half's work.
4	Please just be prepared to wait. 99% of the time they only have 1 cashier in the morning and you will be waiting in line. Staff is super duper diddly friendly.The store is very organized.
5	Not much you can really review about a gas station. However, I must say that I was impressed that they had my change ready for me after I was done pumping. I didn't even have to ask. So yes, I like this place. I will return.
3	I stop here at least three times a week on my way home from work, for all kinds of random stuff.  I do not buy gas here (wayyyy to expensive), but the two guys I always see behind the counter are awesome !!!! Fun, nice sweet and remember me.  I love that type of customer service.Here is what I don't like, though, I always go in there and the clerks know me by name I have to snow them my ID EVERY TIME I buy an adult beverage.  It's so annoying, first off I'm 33 years old(shhh dont tell), second sometimes I don't want to lug my whole purse or wallet in, I just wanna jump out right quick and get whatever and be on my way.  This rule of every person every time is annoying!!!! It needs to change, like I don't have time for it and I understand its a rule but come on now!!! My age and birthrate are not gonna change in 24 hours.  If this changes its 5 star central for this convenience store!!!
