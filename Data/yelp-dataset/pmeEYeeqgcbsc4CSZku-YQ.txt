4	Tasty locally owned and operated sub sandwich shop. Previously an instance of Zero's.
1	Yes this was a 5 star, but it is closed for ever
5	I loved Brenda's Subs. They are now out of business at this location, and I don't think there are any other locations. They had Philly cheese steak sandwiches and Philly chicken cheese sandwiches that were the best I've even had. Brenda's Subs, you will be missed.
