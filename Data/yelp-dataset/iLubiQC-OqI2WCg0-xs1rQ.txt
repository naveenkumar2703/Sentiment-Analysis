4	Four stars rather than five because this Popeyes seems to go a little light on the spice when you order "spicy" chicken. The heat level isn't where it usually is for Popeyes. Maybe they get complaints that it's too hot otherwise, I don't know. Aside from that, this is a fine Popeyes location: clean, easily accessible from the beltway, and the service is always prompt and friendly.
5	What can I say?Who doesn't like Popeye's?I like it, I luv it, I want some more of it!  These have got to be the BEST mashed potatoes.....and the Louisiana hott sauce? mmmmmmmmm....How do they get away with using the name? Isn't it copyrighted or something?
5	Dare I say it? I LOVE Popeyes and I think that it definitely kicks any other chicken fingers/fried chicken competitors you know what! I've been a big fan of Popeyes before they opened all these locations and when they were just on the corner of Rancho and Bonanza. I think what makes Popeyes so good is that you can add some heat to the chicken.  I always tend to favor the SPICY chicken strips and of course the cajun mashed potatoes. Anytime I'm feeling sick I always ask for the mashed potatoes. There goes my love for carbs again! Overall, I'm definitely a lucky girl that Popeyes is close enough for anytime I need some spicyness and comfort.
4	Luv the this place , spicy chicken is awsome u can order all thighs :). The red beans and rice are delicious , wish I had the recipe. I know 4 stars for a chain get over it , I like it  . My review my opinion ;)
3	Crispy fried chicken with Biscuits and sides like red beans and rice. A tasty quick meal with a little bit of southern flare. My husband loves this place, and could eat chicken daily. As for me, I enjoy the chicken, especially when it's spicy like this place. For quick meal pick up, this place is the good choice.
