3	Great store furniture is unique.
4	I would like to buy everything in this store! Right now I am on a budget but I plan on buying a few things over the next year.
2	Very unique and interesting pieces however poor customer service.Could hardly find someone to help us when we had questions and not very friendly.Do not expect them to negioate on price - not happening there.  And if by chance you get lucky it won't be very much.Good thing they have nice furniture b/c  they couldn't survive on their customer service skills.
5	Walked Into this store for the first time today and I was Wowed!!! This is hands down the best and most unique furniture store I have ever been in ( I've been in lots)! Hoping they decide to put one in the North Phoenix area. New homes are popping up like crazy and those people need new furniture! I know the perfect location in a closed down Best Buy at Happy Valley and Lake Pleasant!
5	They are now located at Mayo Blvd. & Scottsdale Road (NW corner).  GREAT prices, fabulous selection and huge variety of styles.  Go already!! Love it!!
