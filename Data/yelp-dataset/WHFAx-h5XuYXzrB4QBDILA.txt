1	wish there were stars in the negative. i actually had geico insurance until they scammed me and did the same with 4 others that i know of. basically; i put my payment on auto for ease and simply made sure i always had money to cover the payment. one day i get stoped by the police because "your registration has been suspended due to lack of payment". well i only found this out after geico had suspended it without notifing me by mail or phone call. so; i go to the dmv only to find out it will cost 750.00 to reinstate the registration and i will be listed as a high risk driver which will raise my rates. when i asked geico why they didn't call me the response was "that is a luxury that we do if we have time".now if that wasn't bad enough geico is trying to collect money on that time they suspended my registration.bottom line is this; insurance company's all quote rates which tend to be almost identical to each other. so; why take the risk with geico and becaome another victim of their scam?
