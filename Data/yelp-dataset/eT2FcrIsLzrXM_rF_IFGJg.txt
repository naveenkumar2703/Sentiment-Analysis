5	"No hassle.  Great Service.  Over and Out."That's their slogan and seems to be the case!  PHX people may see their sexy cars touring round the streets.  I found it hard to classify this and though they can get Web Design done, they are actually a HOME SERVICE to fix any MAC computer issue you may have.  They leave the other Apple service companies far behind on all counts...
5	The team at Mac Troopers has helped our business get on the right track and stay there. We are an all Mac integrative medical facility and our system was in need of some serious attention.  We called Mac Troopers and they came out, assessed the situation and created a plan.  They executed the plan and guess what!?!- everything works.  As our business and staff have continued to grow, they take care of all of our networking needs.  They service our server and all our Mac machines.  They help us with software issues, adding new email accounts, backing up our system.  They give us great advice.  They always respond to my requests within a couple of hours.  They are professional, courteous and smart.  I would highly recommend them to any business.
5	One of my clients uses this business as their tech support.  I was calling in to get synced with my client's management system, and the owner (I think his name was Jay but I'm sooooo bad with names sometimes) was on the call with us.  He was aMAZing.  Not only was he helpful in getting me on the main server computer, but when our mutual client had questions about what was happening, he was like a consultant/therapist.  Seriously - he was incredible.   I would highly recommend these guys!
