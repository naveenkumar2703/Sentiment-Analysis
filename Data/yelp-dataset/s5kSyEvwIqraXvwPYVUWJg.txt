1	I ate here on a business trip earlier this year.  The pizza was OK, but the service left something to be desired.  I ordered a medium "Deluxe" pizza with anchovies as an extra, and they forgot the anchovies.  When I complained about it, the waiter took it back and the cook staff put the anchovies on top of the pizza without reheating it.  I was already pretty fried from a tough day with a customer (software consulting can be that way), and this pretty much pushed me over the edge.  Too much business travel can take you to some dark places, and chain restaurants with mediocre service can bring out the worst forms of existential angst and loneliness .  I really hated this place.
3	Grade: COkay food. Interesting service. I think this place doubles as a meat locker at night. Is the air conditioning supposed to be on in March?
3	Like TGI Fridays but with pizza.  I've always had decent service there and the menu items are usually pretty good.  They do a good job with take out.
