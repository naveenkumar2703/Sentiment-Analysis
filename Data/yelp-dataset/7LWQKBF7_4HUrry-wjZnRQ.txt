3	I usually associate shop front arrangement of fruit and veg with shabby looking punnets of strawberries, bruised fruit and the faint whiff of over ripe apples. Successfully battling this stereotype is Zain Halal food store which unlike the above has a well kept selection of fresh fruit on display outside the entrance.  You'll find the usual pears, pineapples and grapes etc but with a tempting freshness not usually found in such grocery shops.Cheap too.
3	It is easy to be drawn to go into Zain Halal Food Store with the huge display of fresh fruit and veg outside the shop. Situated in the Tollcross area of Edinburgh, Zain Halal Food Store is just a short walk from the city centre and so it is a convenient place to reach. Zain is a family run store which makes me more inclined to shop here. They sell a huge range of different food produce, including continental and Eastern European foods. Zain offer a wide selection of different herbs and spices, which would be difficult to find in the conventional supermarkets, so here is a fantastic place to go to buy exotic flavours. Halal meat meat is also available here, as well as fish, which is always incredibly fresh, especially their salmon - yum! The fruit and veg in the display outside the Zain Halal Food shop is always fresh, perfectly ripe, and best of all, very reasonably priced!
4	This really is a very good shop to buy fresh food from.  Not only are the items of the highest quality, but they are also very reasonably priced.The main point that lets this place stand out is the range it offers - many grocers cannot supply all you want at good prices, but whether it's potatoes, fruits or vegetables this place manages to provide them and without emptying your wallet.This is certainly the best in the immediate area and well worth a visit to check out.
