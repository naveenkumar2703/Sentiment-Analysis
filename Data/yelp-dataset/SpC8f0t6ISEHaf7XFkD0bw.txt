4	This Leslie's has been around FOR-E-VER. I'm not entirely sure how long, but ever since I can remember they've had this location, and I'm 28, so take that into account. I think they have prime location. Around a lot of older neighborhoods where every other house has a pool in the backyard. Not to mention these pools need maintenance.I've dropped in here on a few occasions to get necessities for my pool. It's nothing really fun or cool, unless I pick up some floatie pool toys or something.The customer service is pretty on par most of the time. Sometimes things seem a bit pricey, but there's only so many places you can buy pool supplies. The convenience factor for me usually wins out over price.
4	The staff here is very friendly and patient, I am a new pool owner so I had no idea how to do anything.  I came in just for knowledge on how to use my pump and clean the skimmer and they explained everything step by step.It's nice they do free water testing, although I think they might do that so they can sell you stuff you might not need (but who knows, I'm new and they are the experts).  I look forward to continuing to shop here and purchase my pool supplies.
5	This is the place to go for all your pool supply needs. This store is managed by an awesome guy named Luis who has been with the company for over a decade and he knows EVERYTHING there is to know about pools. He will tell you what you need and not try to sell you a bunch of stuff that will not get the job done right the first time either. Staff is very nice and knows how to handle beginner pool owners and the most experienced pool service employees alike. I live on the West side of town and go well out of my way to see Luis and his staff whenever I have a pool issue. The experience, knowledge, and customer service will leave you 100% confident that you have the right product or info.
