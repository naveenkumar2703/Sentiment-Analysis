4	If you are not familiar with Assouline, you are in for a treat.  This location is very nice, and they have fantastic gifts and coffee table books, among other things.  From Barbie to Picasso, they have something for everybody.I was able to find an interesting book on American Cities that I sent to my Dad for Father's Day.  He loved it, and it certainly isn't something he would have seen at Border's or Barnes and Noble.  Everything in this store is completely unique and special.  The staff is very friendly.  They have a site with online shopping if you find something perfect in the store and want to grab it later.  Good stuff all the way around.
5	An excellent bookstore.
5	I was mesmerized by the gorgeous books in Assouline.  Large and small books of every desire.  I especially loved the oversized Equestrian - Polo books.  It takes you back to the times when books were handed down from generation to generation.  I bought a gorgeous coffee table book about vintage wedding gowns.  I also want to say the customer service was excellent!
5	im in love. bestest bookstore ever. wonderful interior. amazing, impressive, & diverse selection. expensive but absolutely worth it. i wish Assouline had more locations. even if books arent your thing, its a must visit & their books are great for gifting.
1	There is no such place.  I thought I was just looking at the wrong address, but when I called the number I found on the net, the number had been disconnected.  At least I got to walk a couple miles in the blazing desert heat watching people getting their moneys' worth out of The Strip. I've never been anyplace else where you can see a guy holding a sign that says "kick me in the balls--$20."   I don't think he was kidding, either.
