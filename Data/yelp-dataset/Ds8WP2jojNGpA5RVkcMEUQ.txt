5	I just got my  brand new Tundra tinted and have nothing but good marks for Manny and Masters of Tint. My truck looks great and the services was fast and friendly. The shop is clean and quality of work is excellent. I never write reviews, but those guys deserve it!
5	These guys are top notch and very accommodating. They worked me right in after a different tint company I had an appointment with just ditched without a call. Not these guys. I drove up and they got right on it. Excellent work and I highly recommend them. I have already setup an appointment for these guys to follow up with me to do our home windows.
5	The guys are the spot to go to give your ride that clean look, as well as excellent protection from the sun for your vehicle. for all the peeps in the AZ area be sure to check them out for your next window film treatment. quick professional and true quality. the team at Masters of Tint really took care of me. I was in town from the northwest and they were recommended to me by a close friend. once I saw the treatment that was completed, I knew my friend sent me to the right spot. I can now proudly say I Highly recommend this team myself.!! - DJ Harlo
1	I had a windshield replaced from 1st Premier Auto Glass.  They said they would replace my tint strip free of charge through Masters of Tint.  I have tried contacting Masters of Tint several times by phone and e-mail and no one returns my calls. I contacted 1st Premier Auto Glass again and was told by the owner he would contact Master of Tint and have them contact me.  Still no call, it has been a couple of months.  I am extremely disappointed in the lack of customer service here and would not recommend this place to anyone.
