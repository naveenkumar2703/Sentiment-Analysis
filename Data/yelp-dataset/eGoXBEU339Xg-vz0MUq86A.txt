4	I have nothing bad to say about this place.  My girlfriend has been coming here for years and loves the customer service here.  I recently bought a pair of shoes here and needed them stretched.  They had them done by the next day.  The staff here is always very helpful.  I will definitely be a return customer.

5	Love LOVEEEE this place! I always get great service here. The associates here are very helpful and attentive. I can get pretty demanding sometimes when it comes to shoes and they've never once been rude to me.. super PLUS :)
5	I went here last week on the hunt for wedding shoes. This was the last stop on my list. I went in feeling very discouraged as I had been looking all day for shoes. Then i found a pair of ballet flats that were just perfect. Although I do not know the sales mans name he was the BEST! The are in the process of moving locations and he looked and looked in the back until he found the shoes. He was so great! I will for sure be a return costumer!
