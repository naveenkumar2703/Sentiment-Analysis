3	Decent button-up shirts at reasonable prices.  One of the better stores at the outlet mall, in my opinion.
4	It's funny how i'm reviewing this store and i'm a girl. Yes, they only sell men's clothes. I come here all the time. They really do have nice shirts, dress shirts, pants and suits for cheap. What i mean cheap is, you can buy $10 for a good dress shirt.
4	Great men's business casual attire, slacks and suiting at affordable pricing. They always have sales so everything is even more affordable if the items you're looking for are part of the sale. This is my go to place for dress pants/slacks because they always have my size and they fit me perfectly. Their dress shirts and woven shirts/button downs are nice too although some just aren't my style. They usually only have 2 employees working when I've shopped here so if you need assistance you may have a little bit of a wait unless you go early when the store is dead!
