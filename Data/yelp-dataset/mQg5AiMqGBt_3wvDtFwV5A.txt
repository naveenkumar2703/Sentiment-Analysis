5	The grounds are kept up better then any apartments I've ever lived in! This place has many  is cute floor plans, clean, great staff, and dog friendly. I just wish parking was a little better, but hey you can't have everything:)
5	Great place!
5	Just a short 15 minutes door-to-door to the strip, this has been by far my greatest living experience in Las Vegas. A true gated community, well manicured lawns, maintenance that answers calls within minutes, you really experience an elevated lifestyle here. The office staff are friendly (especially Brent who has been more than helpful since signing my lease), pool is amazing on the weekends with cabanas and plenty of room for all of your friends. Also, can we talk about the 2-story floor plans? Amazing. The complex itself is very quiet, very clean, and VERY convenient. Minutes from Target, Town Square, Raising Canes (heaven), and Glaziers (the best grocery store ever.) While the prices here are nowhere near other complexes around, it's obvious that your dollar here really gets you the best. I'd recommend this place for anyone looking for a spectacular place to live.
