3	This is a big shopping/strip mall area offering almost everything to satisfy your needs...it isn't exactly amazing, but there are tons of choices for restaurants.  It's not exactly a mall so it's not a destination, but they have a lot of stores so it can be an easy one-stop destination spot.
2	This place looks nicer from the outside than it is. It's full of mainly low-end retail stores in the main building, as well as chain restaurants flanking it. For the frugal, this might be a treasure trove, as there are many outlets for cheap buys. It's hardly a destination and it's frequently a zoo. The strangest aspect of it is that it's just a stone's throw away from the 180 Biltmore Center. If you need clothes, you're on a tight budget and don't mind stores that are virtually torn apart from rabid shoppers, this is a destination. For tourists or people who want to enjoy a day out on Camelback Road, this is bypass shopping center.
1	This is usually how thinking about the Colonnade goes for me:"I need to get some of that sweet new Martha all-purpose paint from Michael's".5 seconds later:"Meh, I'd rather stay home than deal with that parking nightmare"Then I'm sad because I don't have the new Martha all-purpose paint.Wah wah.
3	Parking sucks! but it's truly the best Marshalls in town.
4	The parking is disaster but the shops are nicely located and there are a large variety of stores. This mall is conveniently located to trader Joes, a library, and many other things so you only have to take one trip to satisfy all your shopping needs.
