4	Dorothy Perkins is another shop that I always forget about when I'm on a shopping spree, which is odd as pretty much every time I venture in I leave with a few goodies. Dorothy Perkins used to be regarded as a little bit frumpy and boring but they have really stepped up their game in the past couple of years and have some stunning pieces to rival the trendy high street stores.The clothes are good quality and they are nicely cut too so sit really nice when you have them on. The prices are affordable and they offer a student discount too - I really can't complain.They still have more sophisticated clothes but they appeal to a broader range of women as before. DP is also a great place to get work blouses, trousers and suit jackets. Their shoes are also very nice and always look a lot more expensive than they actually are.
3	I feel Dorothy Perkins can be a hit or miss. It is like Topshop for older, dare I say frumpy, people. There is occasionaly some nice shoes or jewellery in here for a reasonable price, and the student discount is handy.However when I find clothing I like I am always disapointed to discover that the only sizes they seem to have a good stock of are sizes 14-18. Therefore I rarely buy clothing in here because the one or two things I do like, are not in my size.I would say that Dorothy Perkins style is better to suited to your mum anyway.
5	I'm quite a fan of good ole DP! Their clothes are reliable, on trend and always comfortable. Cast your mind back, have you ever found a hole in a DP t-shirt? have you ever ripped your DP jeans? Have you ever got a blister from DP heels? No.This particular branch isn't anything special, has all the latest lines and reasonably priced!My one criticism is with their mailing list - I am literally emailed EVERY SINGLE DAY!! Come on, is it necessary?
