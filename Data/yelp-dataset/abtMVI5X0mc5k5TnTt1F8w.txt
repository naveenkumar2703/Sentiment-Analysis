4	This is where I buy all of my general jet ski stuff. Plugs, primers, gaskets, etc. The guys here are all very friendly and easy to talk to. I forget the older guy's name at the parts counter, Jesse maybe. He's very knowledgeable and usually has a some unique perspective on my engine problems that I haven't thought of. Why the missing star? They're not open on Sundays (I know I know, when then would they go to the lake?) and they don't always have the parts I want in stock.
5	I bought a canam commander from them and love it!!! The customer service there is absolutely great. Matt & Dan were a great team to help me make my decision! If you need a boat I hear this was the place to grab one!
