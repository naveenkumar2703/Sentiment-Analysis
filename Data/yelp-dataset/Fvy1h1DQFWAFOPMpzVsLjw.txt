5	If you are looking for a tattoo in Edinburgh, this is the place to go. The quality of of artwork is exceptional, head and shoulders above most other places. The resident artist Bradley George has been in the business for a while and his experience shows. Specialising in Rockabilly and traditional tattoos, his candy skulls are exceptional, as are his roses. I have a particular penchant for black white and red tattoos and his colour mixes work really well, with good quality ink meaning that the detail stays longer and doesn't fade as much as normal.Due to the fact that they do not do piercings they can specialise in tattoos and this focus definitely shows. As well as the resident artists they are one of the few tattoo studios to have international pulling power, with some of the artists from Miami Ink having made guest appearances. Whilst maybe not as good as some of the top studios in London, Love Hate Tattoo is noticeably cheaper and is one of the places you will definitely not regret getting a tattoo from.

I love my tattoo and I now have a place I want to go back to and tell everyone about.Chad Chesko, who tattoos me back home - I will forever use him as the bar. J was swinging on the bar. J was tightrope walking the bar. J locked his bike on the bar. J leaned against the bar and made a phone call. J knew this bar, and he kept the level at the bar. In addition to that, he talked me through my rib tattoo in as little pain as it could have possibly been (which is still a lot, honestly). He has an adorable Spanish accent which made for fun tattoo conversation. "You alright?""Yep" (huge breath, grit teeth)"Ok so I'm doing the top part now""Ok." (huge breath, bite lip, cry secretly) The outline that he did of a map for me was so detailed, thin and accurate, he should probably draw maps for a living (on the side of course).
