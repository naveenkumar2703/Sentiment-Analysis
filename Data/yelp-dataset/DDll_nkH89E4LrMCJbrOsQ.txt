1	This would be a great place except for one thing, everything is in french. Now this is great if you are looking for french manga, but in Montreal you'd think they could have some english manga, among their collection of 3000 books. So if you're looking for english manga, there is absolutly none to be had here, just book shelves and book shelves of dissapointment.
