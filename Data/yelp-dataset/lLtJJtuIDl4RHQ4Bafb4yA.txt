5	I had a landscaper that was pretty good in the beginning, but then they started skipping dates or only doing the backyard and not the front. I actually started getting citations from my HOA! So, I asked around and one of my friends recommended Corona Landscape. I've been using them for about 6 months now and I couldn't be happier. They haven't missed a date yet and they do a really great job. Oh, and I had a broken sprinkler head (from the previous landscaper, of course) and Corona just went ahead and fixed it... for free. If you're looking for a landscaper in Tempe, I very highly recommend them!
1	I'd love to review this service but unfortunately I am unable to.  I called for a quote which was apparently too small to warrant a call back.  I found this out after calling back myself.
5	Super reliable and they do great work!  Very reasonable rates too.  :)
5	OMG!  They did a WONDERFUL job!  I was soooo happy with their work.  It was the best landscaping job I've had on my prop!  Found them here on Yelp!  Yep! Yelp!  Ed is sweet and very professional.  In the words of my old friends Ren and Stimpy, "Joy, joy, joy!"
5	Totally recommend this landscaping company.. They did a great job. Very reliable and what I really liked is that they had more two guys show up.  They had about six. Thank you for making my yard look good again.
