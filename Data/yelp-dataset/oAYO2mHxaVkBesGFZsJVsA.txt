4	Twigs does not sell bits of old branch, like the name might suggest, but instead a beautiful range of flowers. There's a limit to how much I can appreciate a florist, being a major hay fever sufferer, but I can still appreciate this place quite a bit. In essence its a florist offering floristy sorts of services. They offer special bouquets for weddings, birthdays, funerals, and whatever other occasions you could hope for. They also offer some standard bunches of flowers to pick up for a date, for a present, or for yourself.There are a number of florists in this part of Edinburgh, but Twigs is one of the better. Very friendly and helpful staff that will be happy to make recommendations if, like me, you have no idea about flower arranging.
