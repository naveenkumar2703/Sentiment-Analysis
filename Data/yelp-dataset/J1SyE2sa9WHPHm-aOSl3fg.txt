4	A large selection of Curry for their lunch and dinner buffet.  This is the second location for this restaurant, the place boasts the best indo Pakastani cuisine.  I don't have anything to suggest right now because im new to this type of food.  Copper Kettle Restaurant is a clean quite place.
3	4 stars for food, 2 stars for service.Went on a Tuesday night at 6:30 and we were the only ones there. Fine by me. One young man there, sitting at a table watching a Bollywood movie on the TV. No welcome, nothing. We sat down at a booth and he finally walked over. "Would you like menus?" "Um, yes please". He tried to direct us to the buffet, but we wanted to go ala carte. Back to his movie. When he brought our food, he set it on the table and walked away. "Um, may we have some plates and utensils please". "Oh, sure". The whole evening was like that. Just disinterested and aloof. Weird.Food was really good, though. Wonderful Kabli Chana (chick peas and potatoes in butter, masala, coriander & other spices. Dal (lentils in garam masala) was a little spicier than we asked for, but smoky, rich & delicious. Onion-stuffed naan and Saada rice were really good, too.So, maybe we go back, but if we do, we take-out.
1	I would not return here again, it was very unclean, and the servers ignored us all night. The food was horrible, way try dry on the chana. I still love the indian place next them.
4	= = = = = =  CLOSED  = = = = = =This nice Buffet has closed, but the same family IS in business at 1964 N. Alma School in Chandler, & it's good.     :-)
1	The amount of oil used in the cooking is beyond ridiculous. Mexican cook for indian cuisine? Really? My wife got diarrhea 1/2 after eating food. Enter at your own risk
