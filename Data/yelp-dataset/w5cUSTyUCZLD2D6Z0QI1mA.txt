5	always has a good selection of hookah! my one stop shop for anything smoke related
1	DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE !! If I could give them negative 5 stars I honestly would . I came here back in December and bought a K-ECIG (150$) with a "Kanger" ProTank 2 (50$) .I recently started having problems with the Vape and also the tank . I went to 3 different stores that are much closer to me . Like PINK SPOT VAPORS they told me I was ripped off and the vape is only worth 40-60$ and that the "Kanger" Pro tank that I have is a KNOCK OFF !!DO NOT COME HERE ! Please if you're going to spend 150+ dollars on a vapor than go to Pink Spot or a place that knows what they're selling ! And if you want to get a ProTank than buy it from an AUTHORIZED KANGER dealer . Like Pink Spot !I am so incredibly pissed I was ripped off and I will be contacting the better buisness bureau and also Kanger letting them know I was ripped off and sold a knock off . My mom also got a knock off Ego vapor which she also over paid for . We're pissed !
5	The Service is wonderful; the extensive inventory is beautiful; and, I highly recommend patronage at this store!
