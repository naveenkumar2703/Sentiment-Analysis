Thank you Desert Rose, for bringing joy, smiles and eternal glamour. You always manage to brighten my day and melt my stress and breath away!
5	This is a Great Local Florist in Carefree and in Scottsdale too. You really can trust them for quality and service. The owners are very nice and the selections are great. It smells so wonderful in their shops. Beautiful displays! Great prices too.
