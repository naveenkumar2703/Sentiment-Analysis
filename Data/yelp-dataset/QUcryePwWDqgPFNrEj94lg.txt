3	A solid, no-frills  neighborhood salon/barber shop. Friendly barbers, quick service and great prices ($15 for a men's haircut).
5	I highly recommend this place. Jeff has been cutting my hair for several years and consistently delivers a great cut at a great price. He always had a good joke to tell too :)
5	Cathy works miracles.  I started with her 20 years ago, and would never let anyone else touch my hair.  Love her!!!!!
5	I have been going to Mike for 34 years. My father and I have been seeing him longer then anyone else. Would not think of going anywhere else.
