5	Had a great experience here. Took them some frames I bought elsewhere to get fitted with lenses. I also managed to get an exam. They were quick and professional and reasonably priced. Dr. Abbott is an experienced optometrist.
5	Dr. Abbott is very kind and patient. His humor makes a routine visit entertaining. I've been going to him for years. He's got a great selection of glasses and most contacts are in stock.
1	I decided to try Dr Abbott out this week.  The front desk was very kind and helpful but the Dr was very rude.  He had multiple snarky comments.  I have a small, part time prescription, that I only wear when I'm driving and getting migrains.  At the end of my appointment he told me, this wasn't much of a prescription, did I just have nothing better to do than to come into his office today?  I can assure you I will not be bothering him with my time or money again.
