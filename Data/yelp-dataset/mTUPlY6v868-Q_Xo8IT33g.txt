5	I hate to shop but as far as shopping goes, this was about as painless as it gets. I just bought my wedding attire here and I'd recommend Nick's to anyone looking for formal wear. We just happened to wander in and Miguel A. helped me find the right look immediately; he knows his stuff. He showed me that a little thing called customer service isn't completely gone just yet. Now I have an awesome, well-fitting suit and it didn't cost me a fortune.
5	Ask for Josh! This place is a stand out....fair prices, quality attire...large selection in suits, vests, shirts, ties and more. I have been here twice...the first time was great...the second time confirmed that this place is a solid find! They are super easy to work with...they have a tailor in house and quick turnaround times. Yesterday I bought another 2 suits (navy & dark olive)...they never cease to impress...can't say enough good things!
