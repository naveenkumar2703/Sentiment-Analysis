4	Needed to have my motor coaches annual service. Arrived late evening on Christmas Day. To my surprise, this Freightliner was completely new with an area for RV's to park overnight. Full hook up with 50 amp. service free for those waiting to be serviced. The night security officer got us all set-up and registered us with their service center. Even without an appointment, they got our coach in first thing the next morning. It took most of the day as we needed extensive work. They kindly allowed us to stay an extra night in the RV section (and the fact that we just plopped down a couple grand for annual maintenance work). Easy on and off the I-10 fwy and there is a Pilot across the street to refuel large RV's. Courteous customer service and prompt.
2	They put on a good face, but they also fall flat on it in some ways. It is great that they have both secure and insecure parking for professional drivers, but their driver lounge is not air-conditioned, so when the truck is actually in the shop, you have the choice of sweating outside, or sweating inside.
5	Everyone is always so helpful when I come in here...even if it's busy!!!
1	If there's negative star I would give them a negative 5 stars. The chandler location are crook and they would steal from you. Stay away from them. I was given an estimate for repairs and the final bills turned to be 10 times higher than the estimate. I initially refused to pay them for the bill and finally had to pay it to get the truck to be released. Definitely going to fill with BBB on this. I can't let them get away from this.
5	Excellent service. Issues with air on Rv. Great Rv hook up allowed us to arrive day before apt and stay there during repair. Room for slide outs. Nice waiting area (grass picnic tables). Friendly staff and efficient job. Appreciate Kirk. We were impressed
