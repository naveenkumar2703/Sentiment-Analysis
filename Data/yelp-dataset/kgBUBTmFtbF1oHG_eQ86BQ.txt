2	It is a beautiful church. While I am not a Catholic myself I attended service last Sunday and this Easter Sunday. Everyone seems nice there but I just don't particularly agree with the comment I heard about how noncatholics are not permitted to partake in communion which is the symbolic intake of the body and blood of Jesus. I believe that if a church isn't a place that a drug addict can feel welcome then it isn't a church. But if your a Catholic living in Phoenix it is a beautifully decorated church and seems to have good people. And during Lent they have the best fish fry in all or Arizona
5	Recently had my fathers memorial service here, with the help from Jean Green. I couldn't have asked for anything more! I really felt good afterwards, a beautiful church, gorgeous chapel, Rev. Greg Mengay was stiller, and the ladies who volunteered their time at the banquet room was great. Even though it was a sad day, St Joan of Arc really made it a lot easier! We used the small chapel with out knowing how many people would show up, Jean made it clear if more then hundred people showed up it would be no problem to move everything to the large chapel. After the service everyone went to the banquet room which was only about 100 feet away from the chapel. We were able to put on a slide show, play music, and was allowed to say a few words to everyone. Food and drinks were provided, and we were allowed to bring our own. Jean, thank you for your hard work.
4	I used to attend Mass at St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church on a regular basis years ago. Yesterday, I felt it was time to return for early Sunday Mass and so happy I did. During the week, I often stop, pray & meditate in the St. Katherine Drexel Chapel - I find it to be very cathartic. Although I'm a member at another Catholic Church, I plan to attend Mass more often here at St. Joan of Arc.
