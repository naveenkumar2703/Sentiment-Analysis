5	My favorite bank. I've only ever had two problems with them and that's in a 7 year time span. Two small problems that they resolved with just a visit to their office and a phone call :) Like I said I have been banking with one Nevada for 7 years now :O I know even I'm shocked :P I tried wamu, Wells Fargo, chase. U name it. But this bank is the best. But don't take my word for it. Go find out for your selves I can guarantee u will love it :)
5	I recently purchased a home and used One Nevada Credit Union for mortgage lending and insurance services.  They were incredible.  I got quotes from several of the big banks and no one could match their rate or their closing costs.  Everyone I dealt with (Roger - loan officer, Karla - insurance services, and Elizabeth - loan processor) were extremely professional and pleasant to deal with.  I could not be happier with the service I received.  I highly recommend One Nevada Credit Union for your banking, lending and insurance needs.  I have had accounts with them since 2001 and have never had a single negative experience.
5	Reina Rocha helped me. She definately exceeded my expectations! This is my second refinance with them. And I'm always very happy with their service.
5	I applied for a auto loan refinance at a very attractive 2.98%. From the initial call to signing the documents it took 4 business days and a very smooth transaction. I met with Monika M. today at the branch where she had all documents ready to be reviewed and signed. Thank you for a professionalism and attention to detail.
