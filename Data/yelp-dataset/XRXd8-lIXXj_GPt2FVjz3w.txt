My site is getting the the traffic and ranking that it needed.  When it comes time for a redo of the site, THEY will be doing it for me!!Tom O'Halloran
5	Definitely professional & trustworthy!
5	Jennifer, Ben and their entire staff are professional, knowledgable, and extremely creative.  They took the time to truly understand what we envisioned for our website and created not just another website but an aesthetically sleek online presence that far exceeded our expectations from design, usability and adaptability.  Take a look at their work at our website;  www.pastafreshvegas.com
5	I used JWD to completely re-do the website for my insurance agency.  I was highly impressed with the organized way that they handle the process.   From start to finish I was aware daily of who was handling what, when to expect things to be done, and what information was needed from me.  The new site is vastly better looking that the old one and it looks like the SEO has improved in just a few days of being live.  Ben's advice on SEO has been invaluable and I look forward to working with JWD in the future to continuously refine and improve the site.   Thanks to everyone - Adam, Erin, Ollie, Ben and everyone else at JWD for your hard work and patience with us getting our site up and running.
5	We used Jennifer Web Design to help us design the entire website (and all social media), as well as the logo, for our new center.  Their ENTIRE team was responsive, helpful, prompt, patient, and encouraging.  They are VERY good at what they do and know the entire system (social media, mobile responsiveness, website, Google analytics, and search engine optimization).  The entire process was well scheduled, allowing sufficient time to review and revise. We will continue to use them!  The entire team is friendly and fun!
5	Jennifer Web Design recreated our website with professionalism and efficiency. The whole team worked in a very well organized way so as our new website to be functional, beautiful and compatible with mobile devices. The quality of their work is excellent. We will continue to work with them so as our website stands out. Thank you for all your efforts!
5	I can speak about Jennifer Web Design with first-hand knowledge, as this company recently helped design the new site for the Fremont Street Experience where I am the Interactive Marketing Manager. This firm knows its stuff, and went above and beyond to deliver a site our company can be proud of. Beyond the appealing layout of the site, Jennifer Web Design essentially gave us our site back from an agency. We're in the drivers seat, and the site has all the functionality we wanted and more. Our project manager, Adam, had been extraordinarily responsive, patient and committed to giving us a site that surpassed all expectations. Mission accomplished! I have been involved with any number of Web site design and redesign projects, and this is honestly the first time I don't want the project to end! Highly recommended.
5	I simply can't speak highly enough about this company.  I have worked with Jennifer and her team for about 3 years now and she has done 2 websites for me, www.heartbreakerguitars.comThe most important thing in creating an ecommerce focussed website is having an open channel of communication with your developer.  I've had hundreds of emails and phone calls go back and forth with JWD over the years and i don't think a single call went unanswered.   Professional, experienced, cutting edge, tech savvy, and above all, incredible communicators.  They are organized and very attentive.  Bridging a gap between themselves and the non-tech person like myself i would say is one of their strongest attributes.  Great job JWD team.  I really appreciate these guys.  And if it's ecommerce that your doing, you better damn sure do your homework on who you pick to be your developer, because you are gonna get very close with them, so  trust is an absolute must.  brendan heartbreakerguitars.com
5	Jennifer and Ben did a great job with our new website.  They were extremely thorough and listened to my needs and wants.  They delivered a great looking site!  I am very pleased!
5	My site isn't quite done yet but I am absolutely amazed at the work ethic and commitment to the job at hand that this company exudes. I haven't been the easiest client to satisfy and they have responded promptly to 99% of my ridiculous request. Great team to work with
