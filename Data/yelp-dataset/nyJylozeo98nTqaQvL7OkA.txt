3	Its a typical fast food restaurant. Its very clean in the mornings when I arrive.Today I decided to write a review as I watched the manager and her staff dance around asking a homeless women to leave their parking lot. Now she wasnt bothering anyone. I saw her when I arrived and watched her from my seat and she was just sitting in the shade of the building and wasnt begging for change or hand outs. The employees said she is gross but since she bought a coffee we cant ask her to leave for at least an hour. Ive been here dressed in my business casual for more than an hour and nobody has looked at me with the same disgust or approached me to say its time for me to go.The food is typical and as long as you are employed I guess you will be treated like a regular citizen worthy of a whopper with cheese.
5	Why would i pick a that fast food restaurant instead of that one? Because of the SERVICE!Doesn't the service add taste to you burger? I mean this staff was Phenomenal! They actually give it to you "Your Way." Food was fast and workers we're very friendly. They go an extra mile just to see you smile :). They took time on the whoppers making sure they look like the pictures. This specific locations is the king of all whoppers :-D
3	This is fast food so it's obviously nothing too special.  You get exactly what you would expect.  I mostly enjoy coming to BK because of the cheap menu items.  A simple BK Stacker/Fries/Drink/ and a sundae will cost me less than $6.  This specific place is usually fairly clean and the service has been good.
4	Plain and simple, this location has never messed up my order.  They are quick, they are friendly, and they are clean.This location is super close to work, so I'm here frequently.  they have a great selection on their "value" menu...Oh and I LOVE the new fries!!!
