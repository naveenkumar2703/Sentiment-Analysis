5	There is only one word for The Felch House Inn. Amazing. We had our wedding there in November 2012 and it was just perfect. Becky is so wonderful and really made us feel at home there and part of the family. The house and the grounds are just beautiful, I couldn't pictured a more perfect place. The location is great in the heart of Phoenix. I really cannot say enough great things about this place. Would also be a great place for parties and company events. I know I will find any excuse to come and visit again!
5	Just attended a wedding here, and the location was beautiful. Tiny little house on the inside, but two floors and so incredibly romantic. There wasn't anything out of place or too kitschy, which was a relief, and from the groom's point of view, it was priced at a very very good range. It was a hipster wedding's dream come true.
5	Our son and his bride recently shared their wedding and reception with over 100 in attendance at The Felch House Inn.  " The evening was awesome and it was the best wedding ever " were the comments we heard over and over !  The owners of this beautiful Inn deserve a standing ovation ! !   Thank you Kathy for creating an unforgettable wedding venue experience.
