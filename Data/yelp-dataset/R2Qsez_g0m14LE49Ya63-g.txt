4	Usually when you go to a salon and spa you get a section where hair is done and then a small section where the "spa" treatments are done.  Usually nothing special.  At XS you will notice a huge difference.  This place is huge and quite beautiful.  They have distinctly separate spa which are far from the hustle and bustle of the salon.  The salon itself is large and pretty with lots of stations and a pretty cool washing station.  Alex is the best, ask for her.  Yes, she is my friend and yes I am shamelessly plugging her but she is incredibly talented and loves what she does.  My hair looks fantastic when she is done with it.  She even gave me a tour of the entire facility, so that's how I know about the beautiful and extensive spa.  They also have a private courtyard that can be rented out for parties and etc.  If you are out in the east valley and want a high quality salon experience, you should definitely go here.  The prices are pretty decent for a high-end salon, especially considering the swanky digs.
1	over priced! not worth service! was not happy with color at all.
4	They have made me feel like a VIP every time I visit for my cut and highlights/low lights. I am always confident in their work and feel like a million bucks every time I leave! One time I tried to die my own hair and it ended up very, very bad. I made an emergency appointment with them and I walked out with the best color and fix I could have asked for-They are well trained Life Savers! I took away one star because they pretty dang expensive, but when I have the money available I thoroughly enjoy this salon and appreciate the quality experience!
