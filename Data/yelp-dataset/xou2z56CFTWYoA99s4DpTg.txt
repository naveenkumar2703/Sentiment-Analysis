1	Well, I went there earlier tonight with my boyfriend. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and soft taco. He ordered the #6 combo, which is the beef chalupa w/a hardshell taco. The inside of my quesadilla was cold and barely had any chicken in it. I was very disappointed. My boyfriend's chalupas had barely any meat in the inside and it was the same for his hardshell taco. I would expect better service and better preparation. We waited an awfully long time about 15 minutes. I don't recommend this place to anyone. The Taco Bell on East Washington is far better.
3	Every once in a while, I get a craving for a Chulapa, and it's off to Taco Bell.  Love those things, and unlike some places, they've gotten my order right EVERY time!
5	I went to this location tonight and ordered food. The guy who took my order got the order wrong. I told the shift manager, Matt, and he fixed the problem immediately. Furthermore, he was polite and had good manners which was a plus. Thank you, Matt!
5	I love Taco Bell, especially when I just want something quick.  I've been to a lot of different Taco Bells, but this one just became my favorite.  The staff was SO nice, and they made it a point to use each customer's name and to (sincerely) thank them for coming in.  The place was clean and well-stocked.  I was in over lunch and they were very busy, but all the employees had smiles on their faces.  The personal touch was great!
