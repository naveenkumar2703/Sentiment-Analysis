5	I have been to several pharmacies and had several really, really bad experiences (I would never recommend going to Walmart pharmacy on Stapley and Baseline, but that's another review to be written...). This is the only pharmacy that has consistently done a really good job and exhibited the kind of competence that you would hope to find in pharmacy staff. These people are putting pills in a bottle for you, so at least being able to read and communicate are usually a good thing. There hasn't been much if any turnover in the core staff (pharmacists and technicians) that I have come into contact with over the past 2-3 years, which says a lot about the place in my opinion. The staff is always very courteous and helpful, and they will usually check to make sure that they have the medication on hand before I leave. I almost exclusively use the drive through, and rarely have to wait more than a minute or so for someone to help me. If the doctor calls in a prescription or if they are short on some of the pills, they will usually call to let me know. They have shared my frustration and tried to help when the health insurance company (deep breaths) give us a hassle about something. It is nice that they don't just dump it all in my lap as some places will do. They are not the closest pharmacy to me (although they are very close) but I keep going to them because of the great service and the consistency. I have not had a messed up prescription yet, and with all of the prescriptions we get, that is a miracle in itself!
4	As far as outpatient pharmacies go, I couldn't be happier with this one. The staff has always been friendly, and prompt to fill my prescriptions. Usually not too busy at this location which makes things much better!
1	This location tries to put used/returned beauty products back on their shelves... be warned.
