3	This is the first drive-only location i have ever seen. It is right across from the JC Penny at Paradise Valley Mall. It does have a couple of benches you can sit on outside to enjoy your doughnuts...and it is very quick and easy to drive thru and get your doughnuts. However with all that being said...a dozen doughnuts cost 9.18 yes...nine dollars and 18 cents...that is ridiculous. The doughnuts are good...but definitely now worth nine dollars and 18 cents (yes i am repeating it again...lol). If however your near PVM and need some good doughnuts this is your place if you willing to pay the price for them. Eat, Drink and be Merry my friends!!!!
4	Hubby and I stopped by the other night to grab some donuts for dessert. Spending $1 a donut isn't a great deal, but Krispy Kreme sells the best donuts we've found since moving to Arizona! YUM YUM!
4	Well after 14 check-ins here and many other times I forget to check in...LOL...I regret to tell everyone this location has CLOSED. I don't know what happened but I noticed everything gone out of the building and off the building as well....last week. This locale will be missed.....and I don't know how long it will be before I have another Krispy Creme doughnut.......:((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((....Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
