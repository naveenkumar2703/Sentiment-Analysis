1	They did the work, but Cheryl Glenn was the most un-understanding person I've ever met. She was running around yelling at the lot guys, totally unprofessional. I feel bad for all those who have to deal with her and her attitude in the service department...
1	This GMC location is shady. They ran my credit score, and didn't print it out and told me it was about 55 points lower than what it really is. Months later I cam back for a test drive and told them the last time they ran my score they lied to me about it and that the GMC on Sahara actually printed it out for me and showed me. So what did they do? The ran it EVEN lower than they did the previous time and tried to get even higher car payments out of me. I will not be back to this location.
1	This place is something else. We sent in my sister's car for service because of her check engine lighted up and the next day it was all set, everything checked and ready to go home. That was until the side right mirror was completely ripped off, and sides of the car had been scratched. THEY DID NOT NOTIFY US THAT THIS HAPPENED. We only found out when my sister saw the right side mirror coming off because THEY TRIED TO HIDE IT BY USING BLACK TAPE. DO NOT USE THIS DEALER TO REPAIR YOUR CAR IF YOU WANT TO BE RIPPED OFF OR TO NOT BE TOLD THAT THEY BROKE OFF A PIECE OF YOUR CAR!!!
