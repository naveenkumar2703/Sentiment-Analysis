4	I'm not ashamed to tell you that this is the best 7-Eleven I've ever been in. It's important to know that I LOVE 7-11's as a rule, mainly because I love 7-Eleven coffee, therefore I tend to be a regular This particular store is consistently well staffed and the workers are all quite pleasant, every single time I've been there. Also, it's not unusual for them to have 3 cashiers working simultaneously as well as a manager  to boot. I like coming here and it's also very convenient because it has gas and is only about 800 feet from the freeway entrance. I just had to say how proud I am that the best 7-Eleven I've been to also happens to be the one closest to my house! WAY TO GO Local!!!
5	I love this 7-11 Store. The workers are super friendly. I'm a true Starbucks drinker but since customer services is on point here, I buy coffee from here :)
