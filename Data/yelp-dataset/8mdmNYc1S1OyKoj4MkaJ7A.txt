3	In my eternal quest for the awesome San Francisco style super Burrito, I came here. I did not find it.The burrito I had was good-just not what I was looking for.
1	So dissapointed. The negitive: Bland tortilla chips, carne asada torta served without beans and very tough meat. How they made guacamole lacking in avocado is beyond me but it was stuffed with so much tomato and other vegetables it was barely green!The positive: The counter guy was nice enough and the dining room was clean and they DO cook in front of you.I'm really not sure I could bring myself to go back in there. The food just kind of made me mad. It could be so much better.
5	Best Carne Asada Taco in Vegas! I dine on fresh-Mex food religiously and Jalapeno Grille is now on my priority list. I started with one Carne Asada Taco and had to order a second. They have a very good salsa bar as well. The salsa verde had a nice smokey flavor and was one of the best I have tasted.
