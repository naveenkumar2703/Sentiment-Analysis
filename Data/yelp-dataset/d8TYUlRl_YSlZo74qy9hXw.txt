4	The 1st reviewer pretty much said it all, but here's my personal take. My hubby & I love It's All Goodz, our fav place to go piece shopping! We've bought multiple pieces over the years, which are all resting in pieces now, except our amazing bubbler from the "middle case" that we barely use in fear of it breaking like the rest eventually do. Any how, we stopped in this past Tuesday night for a new piece. It's been over a year since we last came here because we moved out of the area & had been checking out other places near us. We've always had good experiences but the guy we dealt with this time was a dick! He was so rude & made us feel like we were bothering him when we asked to look at a few different ones, sorry to make you get off the computer dude! That didn't affect my rating though, since this was the 1st time we encountered a douche bag employee. We ended up getting a pretty sweet piece that I should have taken a pic of! We'll be back for sure, just hope we don't have to deal with that guy again.
3	This is my favorite smoke shop to browse, but just not my favorite to shop in. The pieces here are amazing. So artful...many of them sold for hundreds of dollars, and looked more decorative than practical. In the back appears to be a little glassblowing shop where some of the more simple pipes and such are made. I totally approve of these trinkets being crafted on-sight.Unfortunately, the items that DO seem practical for use are nothing out of the ordinary. Also, the hookah tobacco (shisha) selection left quite a bit to be desired. In short, it's amazing to look at, but nothing seems worth buying unless you're a collector.
