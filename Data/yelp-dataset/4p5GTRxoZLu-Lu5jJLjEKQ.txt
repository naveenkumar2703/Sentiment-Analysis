4	This sleek little Italian place (formerly LV Grill) left my mouth watering taste buds a-tinglin'. All the ingredients are super fresh and many are imported from Italy. The pizzas are amazing: thin crust, excellent toppings. I had the pizza with Buffalo Mozzarella from Italy, which was generously topped on the pizza along w/ some good sauce and cherry tomatoes. Olives and cheese were delicious as well. The waiter (also owner?) seemed like he was from Italy, a good sign. I'm going back for some panini.update: went back for some panini, which was sub-par, dropping my rating to 4 stars. this place is always empty, which is kind of a drag, but the buffala di mozzarella pizza is the shoopsie, my noopsie.
5	This is a lovely little place with fabulous food and attentive, personable staff.  The thin crust pizzas and meatballs are excellent.  Don't let the offbeat location deter you -- this place is a gem.
5	Off the beaten path, Bistro Divino is an excellent find. Intimate, yet not pretentious, it's a warm and welcoming place. Live music at times, but it's not overwhelming and it actually compliments the place well.I'm a huge carnivore and went during Lent on a Friday (meaning I should only eat fish). At first I was upset that I wouldn't be diving into some delicious Italian sausage...but I ordered their house specialty cheese n' veggie pizza and did not miss the meat at all! So an Italian joint that satisfied and filled me up, based on their veggie pizza alone. Excellent.Obviously, I'm not a local, but during my trip to to Vegas (and staying on "the Strip" and frequenting its many eateries),  I can honestly say that Bistro Divino was the best meal and dining experience I had.
