5	Great DJ service. The guys were very professional and once the event started they knew how to get our guest up and having a good time. You have to opt in and get the photo booth. Our guest felt like celebrities. These guys rock!
5	We used 8-Bit Entertainment for my friends wedding photo booth and it was great! There are a ton of props to choose from and the quality of the photos are clear! I would definitely recommend 8-Bit Entertainment to anyone!

5	We had this company do a photo booth for our party and it was a huge hit. Everyone had a blast taking photos and at one point we had 14 people in there! They were kind, professional, and patient. Highly recommended!
5	We had 8-Bit Entertainment DJ for our wedding from ceremony, cocktail hour to reception.  We received a few compliments from our guest at how engaging our DJ was and we couldn't agree more!  We were also pleased with the song selection. Thank you for a wonderful service.
