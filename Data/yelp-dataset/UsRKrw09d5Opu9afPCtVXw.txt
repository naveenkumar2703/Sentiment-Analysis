5	No reviews for Love Carpet yet? I have had them out to my house twice this year and have been satisfied both times. They are always on time and sometimes even early, but never late! They do the job quickly and efficiently. My gross super old carpet looks pretty dang good when they leave. The tech was courteous and not creepy in the least.
5	I had such a great experience with Love Carpet Care and Repair. They were friendly and courteous and enthusiastic every time I spoke to them on the phone, and their work was incredible.  I hired them to clean a carpet in an apartment.  The leasing office at the apt complex told me the carpet was in such bad shape they would have to trash it.  (Quick aside: I did not live in the apartment, but I was responsible for the damage...)  Love Carpet Care did such a good job cleaning the carpet it looked nearly new again.  Truly outstanding.  And, most importantly, the price they quoted me beforehand - when I gave them an honest account of the condition and size - was the final price.  Love it!  And it was cheap.  I was desperate and upset enough that they really could have charged me anything, but they were wonderful.  Honest, hardworking, helpful.I could never say enough good things about this company.
