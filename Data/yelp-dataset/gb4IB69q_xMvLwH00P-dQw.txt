5	Friendly place, reasonable price, and clean clothes for my kids.
5	Always find great things when I shop here.  The place is clean, smells good, and unlike other resale stores.  They have lots of cute clothes and usually there's special discounts too.One favorite spot for me and my friends to check out almost on a weekly basis as we always find cute stuff and great deals for our little ones.I've sold to them also and always happy get store credit to pick up more things for my kids. :)Staff is very friendly and prices are great.
5	Really great deals and very kind staff.  Not too pushy and not too hands off.  I am so addicted to consignment shops.
5	Kids are expensive, especially when they grow like weeds and you have to constantly buy new clothes and new shoes.  This is now my go-to place.  I recently bought an adorable Gap velvet Christmas dress and Gap shoes for my daughter.  Both for a TOTAL of less than $15.  There are also bassinets, walkers, crib bedding, strollers, and car seats at a great price.If your garage or closets are filled with small clothes or baby/ toddler items no longer in use- you can make some money by selling it here as well.
5	I love this place but I have bad news...it is closed. Looks like they moved out a while ago. There is no signage and nothing in the store. Bummer.
