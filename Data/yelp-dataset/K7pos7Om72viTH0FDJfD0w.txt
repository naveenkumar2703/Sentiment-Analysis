5	GAMING AND BANDS Are old school Vegas style at its best!
4	Stopped in Saturday night after a huge kerfuffle at a bar down the street. (i will be keeping names out of it for now, but the bar was 100% in the wrong.)Took about half the crowd from the other bar and came down to Cavalier.First time I'd been here.Cheap drinks, very friendly bar staff...and the place was DEAD.  My only complaint?  Only one pool table.We had a really good night because the staff here kicked ass.  Great job guys.  We'll come back again.
5	Closed.  But being rehabbed now.
