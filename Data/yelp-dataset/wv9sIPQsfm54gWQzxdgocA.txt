4	Not too shabby and only about a mile or so from downtown Tempe! I pricelined this place for $25 and won. Explosive.The room was decked out with a fridge, toaster, nice desk and the queen bed was quite comfy. My companion and I even even chilled in the outdoor veranda pool area, alongside 10 or so white middle aged golfer types drinking beers and puffing on a few cigarettes. It was very chill. The front desk people were quite professional with check in procedures and very helpful with directions. Very solid hotel for $25! For the amount paid for this place, it deserves more than an A-OK.
3	Plus side: Kitchen included cooking/eating utensils, clean, near Tempe hot spots. Bad side: can get a little noisy, staff was non-existent, and housekeeping services can be an extra charge. Overall, for the price charged this is a pretty decent deal.
2	staff was friendly and so was the crowd, but it was a special crowd.  If I'd been booking a hotel would have spend an extra 20-30 and stayed somewhere nicer.   This is a cheap hotel/extended stay and you get what you pay for.
5	Nothing wrong with hotel as long as you realize it's an extended stay hotel and not the Ritz. Place is clean and staff is friendly. I've been here for over a month and had no issues.
