4	I can't believe no one has reviewed RELAX, the Hardrock's day after REHAB pool party!Well, RELAX is for those of us who don't have to fly back Monday, and who enjoy a pool party without the craziness that is REHAB...... don't get me wrong, REHAB was fun, but after a long Vegas weekend, it's nice to just enjoy the pool, be able to get a drink at the bar, and for some reason, the pretty people show up to RELAX....maybe they were at REHAB, but you just couldn't see them....So skip that flight Monday, hang out a Relax, and enjoy the pool with all the industry peeps.
4	RE-LAX is the perfect name for this Monday pool party. It was so chill. The weather was just right. We had a cabana with a flat screen in it so we were able to watch LA vs DENVER while sippin on some drank and eating finger sandwiches.This is not the spot to come 2 if your tryna swim cuz this is strictly for play. They even have a couple of tables in the water if u just cant seem to loose the gambling fever. The only thing I had a problem with was the DJ. He didn't play not 1 song that made me wanna get up and shake my groove thang.Overall...I Can Dig It.
