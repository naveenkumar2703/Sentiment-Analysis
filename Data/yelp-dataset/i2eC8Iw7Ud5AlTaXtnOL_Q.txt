4	I was here on the day after the opening day and got some good finds.  Despite how chaotic it was, I haven't forgotten that the girl facilitating the dressing rooms offered to get additional items for me and followed through.Since then, the selection has remained consistent.  I usually like to get some v-neck t-shirts because they are comfy and fit well.  My best find was when I discovered a complete suit on the clearnance rack for about $60!  The prices are generally hit or miss, but hopefully their deals will improve with time.
4	nice store....lots of deep discounts. i don't shop here but i posed the ? to my wife "The prices seem steep. Do they just mark them up and then deep discount to lure shoppers in?". She replied that everything in the store is cheaper than a retail store Banana Republic. So now i am set straight. all the staff were helpful and there were plenty of mens clothes to choose from.
5	Picture this! Me in the role of Maria, from THE SOUND OF MUSIC, running around the store singing "These are a few of my favorite things" ;D Okay, OKAY! I'll bring it down a notch :) But I do love everything about this place. I love their clothes, I love their layout/organization & I love their sales. The staff is really nice too, even when you ask them about 'other stores' in the area... doesn't seem right, but they are all about the customer, which can never be wrong! right? lol
5	By far, the most helpful and friendliest BR outlet I've visited EVER (and I've been to my share around the US).  We were greeted upon arrival and the store was fairly organized for a holiday weekend.  Had to do a return; a pair of pants that I bought for my sister last Jan.  Sabrina and Oscar were very accommodating and took care of the (out of policy) return in an efficient manner.  Keep up the great work!
