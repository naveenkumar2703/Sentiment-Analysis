5	ALTO.what you think is a damn good taqueria here in SF is all wrong.It's OK. I was swayed into thinking SF had the real deal Mexican food when I moved here years ago, too. BUT, my tongue, saliva, taste buds, and mi estomago all agree that Big Burrito was the best I'd had since I left the Southwest- no doubt.I pulled up to the double sided drive through one recent sunny Phoenician afternoon. I was on the lookout for a veggie burrito...THEN IT HIT ME. El Duuuh!! It's California (especially SF) that has made a Veggie Burrito a wrapped up Mexican salad (a ton of veggies, some you really dont want + other junk)....Yes, it can be bueno, pero no autentico.In my scenario, a veggie burrito translated to a bean & cheese burrito. Simple you say? Ohhhh it holds it's own. They just don't make it the same here. YES, and I'm referring to the Mission. You have to keep going South, my friends...Make a run for (or towards) the border.
5	This is where I fell in love with carne asada burrtios!When I moved from Chicago to Phoenix, I had no idea what Mexican food could be.  This was the first place I had tried because it was within walking distance to home & school.  I must have eaten here twice a day for an entire semester.  Today it's more of an after-the-bar treat.  This is the benchmark for all burritos.   You may feel the need to high five someone after eating one.I can only relate in analogy. It is Garfield's lasagna, Bert's oatmeal, Laestragonian's Acheans, Olympian Ambrosia, and Elvis's peanut butter and banana freakin' sandwiches all wrapped into a burrito.
