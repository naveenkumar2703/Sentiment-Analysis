5	Love Dr. Kurtz and all the staff.  They always have time to get a sick kiddo in.  I don't think I've ever had to wait. My daughter doesn't mind going there (as long as her much dreaded throat swabs are not part of the equation).  And she is always ready to tell the staff what is going on.  They make the parents feel at ease and explain everything.  They want you to ask questions and be as informed as possible.
2	We had our first appointment with Paradise today.  We arrived 30 minutes early to fill out paperwork and watched the waiting room fill up with patients, then watched them all go in ahead of us.  We had our three year old and our 14 month old with us and despite checking in with the front desk multiple times, we ended up waiting for over 75 minutes to be escorted to the room, then waited another 15-20 for the doctor to come in.  By this time, both kids were getting really bored and our little guy was crying as he was due for his nap, which is why we set the appointment time early in the first place. When Dr. Kertz FINALLY came into the room, she told us that she'd just been sitting at her desk eating a snack and had no idea that we were waiting!  She was nice and competent, but her nurse then bungled the shot my daughter needed and scratched her arm with the needle.  It was a pretty crappy visit and I don't think we'll be back to see if they can improve the next time.
5	This place is wonderful, I had a previous pediatric office for my two children and it was a joke.They are wonderful, the staff is friendly, easy to get an appointment (even calling for the same day), and don't have to wait around a long time.You can tell the staff really enjoys working here, as you can here laughter with patients, etc.Dr. Kurtz, is very kind and understanding. Any question you ask her she doesn't make you seem like its a waste of her time.Very happy to find a great local doctor office who care!
