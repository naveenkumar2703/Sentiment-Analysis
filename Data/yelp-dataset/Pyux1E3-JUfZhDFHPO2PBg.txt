1	NEVER USE THIS COMPANY!Simply called for a quote on a simple door repair and was turned down because Owner/Manager did not think it was worth his time??Use Vortex and save yourself the headache!
1	This is one of the worst services I have ever had, PERIOD.I had these guys come and fix the front door of my restaurant for $500. I was told there was a warranty.Within a half year, the door broke again on the first windy day since the repair. When inquiring about the warranty, they told me parts were free, but labor would be around $500 again. Furthermore, instead of taking responsibility, they had the gall to now tell me that our door shouldn't open outwards, and that we should just keep it open all the time on windy days and wait until it is no longer windy before closing it.  Right... after 11 years in business, it was just PURE LUCK that the door never broke. And when it finally did, their "repair" lasted less than half a year.  This is absurd, and borderline FRAUD. Never ever use their services, unless you want to donate to a shady business.
5	Door King is Great!  I had an estimate from the owner Roger just over a week ago and today was the install date.a.  They are on time, actually early.b.  They are craftsman.c.  They can fix anything.d.  Price is not cheapest, but if you want quality work this is it.e.  They do extra things to make sure you are getting the quality you want.In the end, I could have done some of the work myself, I could have gotten cheaper quotes and all, but when you want first class work, try Door King.I highly recommend them.
