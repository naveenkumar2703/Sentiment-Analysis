4	Cute little store with fun merchandise, kind of pricey.  I always find something to buy here, usually nail polish or hair and nail accessories.  I went in today on a fast trip before a movie to see if they had any Xmas nail decals.  They didn't but I ended up with some pretty nail art stencils, a silver nail art pen, and a magnetic necklace.  They always have something on sale, too.  It's one store I'll always pop into when I'm in the mall.  The clerks are nice and helpful here, too.
4	I really enjoy shopping in packed, colorful places. Claire's is no exception! Their earring selection is wonderful and they're always coming out with new lines of merchandise. It's quite a trendy store, even if it's targeted at younger girls. I wear my Claire's accessories with pride! ;) This location is almost always busy. I've gotten my ears pierced here many times (they did 15 studs in my left ear, believe it or not) and, despite what you've heard about piercing guns, I've never had a problem with any of them. They don't used spring-loaded guns anymore and for the price, it really cannot be beat.
4	this store is always a cluttered mangled pile of jewelery! The perfect place for tweeny boppers. My daughter got her ears pierced for her 11th bday (2nd hole) and the assistant manager did a great job and even shoed away the weird older lady failing to be a cheerleader! Thanks!
