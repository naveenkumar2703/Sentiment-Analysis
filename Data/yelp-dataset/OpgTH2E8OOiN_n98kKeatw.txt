2	Don't swim in the pool.
3	Though not luxurious by any means, this Days Inn was clean, comfortable, and quiet. It was cheap -- just over $80 before tax -- and had free breakfast. For breakfast, I'd have preferred some fruit other than apples rather than biscuits with gravy (ewww), but they also had cereal, milk, bagels, bread, peanut butter, cream cheese, little muffins and pastries, instant oats, juice, coffee, waffles, and yogurt, so there was a lot to choose from. None of it was fantastic, but hey, it was free!
2	Better then last nights stay in Manchester TN - That was the worse Days Inn I have ever encountered, so anything would have been better - room was OK clean, desk clerk very nice and friendly.  Breakfast was not good - 1 roll left when we got there and the morning desk clerk got that one when we were eating. Nothing hot to eat - no waffles - not like other Days Inns that I have stayed in -- the waffle was a toaster waffle - but ate it as I was hungry.  Hope I do not have to go back - but if I do it will be a OK place to sleep.
5	Clean, friendly and competitively priced. Rolled in around 2 am and the very nice front desk agent let me help myself to the continental breakfast stash since everything nearby was closed and it was freezing out. Since they don't officially offer military discount they were still kind enough to knock $10 off the already low $69 nightly rate. It's hard to find exceptional service like this at a 5 star let alone a regular hotel.
