3	This was just an OK experience.  The food trays on display weren't full.  The food came out hot though.  This is more like a food court type of restaurant and there are many other menu selections from the adjoining restaurants.  The food court itself was pretty clean with ample seating.  The staff at Wasabi Janes were courteous, poite and prompt.

3	Let me start by saying that I am an Asian (Japanese) senior citizen.  A business that calls itself "Wasabi Janes" should serve better wasabi.  What I had tasted like horse radish with green food coloring.  The sushi was decent but would have been much better if it had not been cold.  It is prepared ahead and kept cold.  The teriyaki chicken was excellent and the fried tofu and rice noodles were good.  Service was good both times I ate there,  The food was fresh.  Common seating was plentiful in the food court (during the week).
2	I wouldn't really recommend this place in the Venetian Food Court. If I were you, and in the mood for  reasonably priced Chinese, I'd head to the Panda Express opposite. Wasabi Jane's fried rice was hard, the salmon was over done, egg drop soup was cold, the broccoli was soft... Even when I asked for an extra plate, they gave me a miniature paper saucer! I was not amused.
