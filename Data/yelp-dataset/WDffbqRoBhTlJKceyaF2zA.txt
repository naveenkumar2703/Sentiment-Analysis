5	Me and my daughter were cruising around when I found this place. I was expecting just a deli for lunch but we walked in and to my surprise it is also had a full diner and a wine bar room along with the market and deli counter to boot! We sat down for lunch I was not expecting the niceness of it at all. There were TVs and lot's of sport's memorabilia. The staff was very courteous and knowledgeable it is family owned and they were very welcoming. I just ordered a Veggie sandwich all sandwiches come with your choice of potato or veggie salad or chips. I went with the potato it was delicious not your avg potato salad at all! It had peas and grated carrots in it and was yellow in color see pics* They didn't really have a kid type menu but they did their best they made her chicken finger's, all their meat's are all natural too! +++ There was not anyone else in the front dining room so I got to chat with the man a bit he said they have been there 2 years I came at a slow time late afternoon after lunch rush which was great we had the whole place to ourselves. He said they have wine tasting on Thurs. night's and Fri. is Poker night which I will surely be returning for asap! Turned out we had the same exact car color and all I don't take coincidences lightly lol! I cant wait to go there for a good dinner and minus a child next time. See their extensive menu of imported beer and wine!It is hiding behind the Goodwill a happy find for sure!
1	This restaurant has been shut down before I could eat their delicious food. Alerting Yelp management.
4	Man this place is/was? really good, great goulash, great sausages, yummy potato pancakes, a really good beer selection.  Last time I went by there, the door was locked, but there were still goods on the shelves, and sausages in the case.  Their website is still up as well.  I really hope it is not closed for good.
