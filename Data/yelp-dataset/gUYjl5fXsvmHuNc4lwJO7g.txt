4	Clean, simple, tons of machines, always working, not even that busy on the weekends... it's a great laundromat.  5 stars would be for a place that has something ridiculous (free wifi, drinks, etc.)... but this is no frills, simple quality.  Now go do your laundry, you're smelling a little ripe.
2	I have no idea what I was expecting from a laundromat, but the 5 star yelp rating made me think of laundry mecca. The floors were not clean and had a bunch of socks and dryer sheets everywhere. The worst part I guess was the smell. Extremely pungent combination of detergent and overall yukiness. I still can't believe we made the 5 mile trek there... And just waltzed right out.However, the machines did look fairly new. It's not worth the trip from downtown imo.
