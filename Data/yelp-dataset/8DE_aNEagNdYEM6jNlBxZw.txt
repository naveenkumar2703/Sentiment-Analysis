4	This CVS has come a long way.  Having previously stopped in, I can tell you I do not know what changed this place, but my most recent visit proved to me that these stores can and do get better!
5	I love this store!!! So much they know me by name and if there isn't a line I'll sit and shoot the shit with the employees!! Haha! That's how shopping should be... Like Cheers! You'll find everything you need here. And like other stores, things you don't need to! (good store, stocked, nice employees. Sorry, it's a CVS, I can't write a "real" review. You get what you get here, a drugstore!)
2	Not a very good branch, was happy they had a minute clinic! But noticed a huge line for the pharmacy. They also had a huge line at the check out booth. People there were very annoyed, and getting frustrated. When we had to wait for the minute clinic, the waiting area was very messy. Not blaming the staff, management had this place very understaffed.
5	Very Impressed with this location always , today Matt in the pharmacy going above and beyond and answering all of our questions , I feel like this is an old time pharmacy that cares about each and every one of it's neighbors.
