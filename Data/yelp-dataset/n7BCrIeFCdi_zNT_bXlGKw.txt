5	The most helpful and creative people in the business!!  Bret, is one of the most honest people I have ever met
5	I believe this company subcontracts for Lowe's. My parents were kind enough to help me get some French doors to installed in my master bedroom as a way to access my yard and went through Lowe's which told us to contact Sunburst. We decided to go straight through them and if I'm writing this review it's because they installed some plantation shutters for the french doors 3 years ago.I had been lazy about it but one of the sides of the shutters was no longer closing 100% and more light than I wanted was coming in. There was also a small crack and exposed hole at the bottom. They use or at least installed on my doors what they call "polywood" shutters. Pretty good quality despite the small crack. I called in a few weeks ago to see what it might cost me to replace them and that's where the 5 star service comes in. I didn't realize they guarantee their product and therefore even after 3 years, they simply ordered the piece, called me for a convenient install time and within 2 weeks I had brand new shutters and the ability to sleep without being woken up by the sunlight coming in. Great company to work with.
