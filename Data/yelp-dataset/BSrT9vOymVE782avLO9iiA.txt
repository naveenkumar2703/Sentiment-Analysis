5	I rented a car from this company last month and the service was awesome. I picked up the car at the airport valet and returned it to the airport valet. No need to step foot in their office or have to go to the rental hub at the airport. Great service and quality cars! HIGHLY recommended!
5	Awesome! Good collection of cars, great service, overall a good deal!
1	Schmucks! Thats who they are! We ordered two same SUV's more than two months in advance in Las Vegas for our wedding, and 3 days before wedding they canceled our order by email because "vehicles have been reserved by a royal family for over 2 months..". When we called and asked to speak with the manager, he explained us that royal family is paying $2k per car and they are getting what they want, and we can contact hertz and see if they have anything, I bet they do have a lot of chevy's.. Thanks again, assholes!
5	Goodluck finding a lambo or ferrari in Vegas to rent when you need it asap!  I called 12 different companies and could not get a car delivered to my hotel within an hour.   The best I got was, you can pick it up tomorrow at 9am.. or We are all sold out.. etc..  I finally said forget google, im going on Yelp, and these guys came up.  Within 30 mins they delivered me a brand new Orange Lambo to my hotel.  I was thrilled, excellent service, perfect car, and a great price too!  I highly recommend this company and will start using them to rent luxury sports cars whether I am in LA or in Vegas!  This place is hassle free and very professional!-Chris B
