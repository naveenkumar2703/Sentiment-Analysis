3	Lunch - Fast service, friendly staff, good prices. Blue collar bar (straight from the Owners mouth) - he didnt seem to mind me in my dress clothes for work, or my iPhone. I plan to check it out for happy hour as well
2	This place is bad. I'm all for dive bars, but this place is just brutal. I felt dirty just coming here.Best Nights:(choose up to 3)     Never
4	Been here once, and the place was friendly and the service was great. The clientele were what you'd expect, and that's just fine with me.
