4	Ordered a cake for a special occasion. Owner was pleasant, gave my daughter a free cookie and free samples for me. Can't wait to see how it turns out!
5	This is one of the best if not the best place in AZ for the real deal italian pastries and cookies.
2	Being from NY we were pretty stoked to find this place and had high hopes. Spent a good amount of time talking with the lady that owns it. Very nice.Sadly the cupcakes were hard and the frosting used on them tasted like it had chunks of sugar in it and was baked by a 10yr old.The Biscotti Cookies had an incredibly high amount of liquor flavor to them, too much so and they were not good.Don't bothering ordering your cupcakes to go because they have no proper packaging to put them in.Disappointed.
5	This bakery brought me back to my childhood with one wiff of their delicious pastries and cookies. The fresh cannoli was creamy and the shell melted in my mouth. There were so many delicious choices, but had an old favorite, sfogiatelle. My husband had the chai tea cupcake with lavender frosting. He said the flavors were amazing, one of the best cupcakes he's ever had! We've tried cupcakes from Whole Foods, but why pay $5 for a cupcake when you can get one that's even better for $2.50. They have fresh baked rolls and bread on the weekend. Can't wait for the holidays to try all my holiday favorites. The owner is generous and a sweet lady. Her love and passion shines through her offerings. Her smile could light a city block. Don't miss out on this gem. True Italian bakery, yum!
