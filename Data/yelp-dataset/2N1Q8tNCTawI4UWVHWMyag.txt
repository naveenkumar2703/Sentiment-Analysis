5	what a great comic book store! I happened upon it during my stroll around Fremont St. it's not giant, but there is a lot there. the guy working was super nice and we chatted about comics for a good amount of time. I'll definitely stop in again next time I'm in Vegas.
5	This is a very nice comic book store. I was surprised that there was so much to look at since the store isn't really big. There were aisles full of comic books and action figures, and they even had some shirts for sell. The backroom was full of back issues, and the guy working there said that more issues were on the way. I was very pleased with the service I got while in the store. The guy was very helpful with any questions I had and even recommended other stores for the stuff he didn't have. With the exception of newly released issues, most of the items in the store are discounted which is great. If you're a fan of comics, definitely check this place out because there is something for everyone to read.
5	This is a great Comic Book Store!  Experienced  and friendly staff!  A must see!!
5	This place is an amazing environment, with awesome treasures to find. The guy from who owns this shop is awesome and I would extremely recommend hitting up this place. He really cares about his customers having a great time in his shop. GO THERE YOU WON'T B SORRY!
4	Great shop near Fremont area and close to those hotels (walk towards Denny s and Walgreens). Small shop but really nice looking layout of toys, comics, books and statues. Has great selection of newer toys and collectables and could have easily spent $300 in there on collectables. Did buy a cool mystery box dc vinyl and a figure had been looking for in several other places. Great staff, very friendly atmosphere and clean, modern store.
