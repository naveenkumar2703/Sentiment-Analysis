5	The only place I go to get my vitamins :) Karen is not only amazing and lovely, she's also incredibly knowledgable and can help you find whatever you need. Love this store ;)
5	I have been buying my supplements and essential oils from Karen for two years now and the level of customer service is great. She is very knowledgable and well informed about all things health and wellness. I love her corner with all the gifts and things. I did part of my Christmas shopping at her place last year. Please drop in and see her for all of your vitamin, supplement, and spa needs. A+++
5	Karen's little shop ROCKS!! Karen is knowledgeable, kind, and caring. She carries quality products and she knows her products. And her stock of loose leaf teas is second to none. I love the organic mango green tea! If you're looking for a trustworthy person to help you understand supplements, Karen is your gal! I do now consider her a friend, but our friendship started with me stepping foot into her store. :-)
5	I love this store! The staff rocks and their process are also pretty reasonable. If you're looking for somewhere with knowledgeable staff, and a nurse that also prescribes medicinal herb blends then this is your place!
5	Love this place!  Went for my first time ever and was blown away at how well the shop was.  Customer service was excellent.  I will be coming back for sure!
