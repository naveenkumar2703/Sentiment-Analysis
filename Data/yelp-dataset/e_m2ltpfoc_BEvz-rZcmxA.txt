1	Please don't shop here. I bought a conure and his wings were clipped when we got him. They were clipped way too high and they actually cut his wing. Poor birdy.
5	My mom and I have browsed the gentlemen in the "scooter" store at least (5) five times in the last 3 years and never bought a single thing.  They were polite and hospitable ( all the staff).  We bought a beautiful 3 month old cockatoo Sunday 8-25-13 for $1100.  Got free toys and food and an awesome cage with wheels.  He even gave us an extra discount for paying cash. LOVE THIS STORE AND STAFF.
5	I browsed this store looking at toys for my eclectus parrot.  The owners are really friendly and their birds are happy, healthy and well cared for.
