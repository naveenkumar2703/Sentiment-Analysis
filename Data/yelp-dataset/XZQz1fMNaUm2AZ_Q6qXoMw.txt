It's an older place and lacks the italian finish you would expect from an italian restaurant. On the bright side, out waiter was very kind. To start, we tried the calamari. They weren't the greatest, but not terrible either. They were slightly too chewy for my liking and the sauce was very overpowering. As for the main dish, order the pizza. They are known for their open fire, and I now know why. The pizza "Buona Sera" was great for what you expect. Not too crispy and the flavours blend properly. Besides that, I wish the menu would be slightly more italian. Either way, for a fast sit down meal, from the east end, this is the place for you.
