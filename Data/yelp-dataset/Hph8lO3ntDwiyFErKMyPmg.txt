2	I agree that the clothes are awesome but at this store, the service was very poor.  My wife was looking for some very specific items and couldn't seem to get anyone interested in helping her.  They were not very busy so it seemed the clerks didn't seem to really care much.  The "clearance" rack was so high up that you couldn't get anything down or even look at it without a ladder.  Not exaggerating. At this price point for clothes I expect better service and someone to pretend to care.
2	I love Athleta clothing but the service at the West Towne store is terrible.I've stopped going there and just order online.  At any time there will be 4-5 people working in the store--and not doing anything--and they will just ignore customers.  It's difficult to get help with anything and if you do have a question or need help, the staff makes you feel like you're inconveniencing them.It's disappointing because Athleta clothing is great - especially for active, athletic women.
