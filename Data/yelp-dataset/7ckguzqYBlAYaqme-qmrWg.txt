4	This is the Starbucks that is inside the Target on Sky Pointe Drive. It's a very small Starbucks, even by in-store standards; however seems to have a fair selection of snacks, mugs and accompanying Starbo swag. I'm embarrassed to admit that I used to avoid the Target this Starbucks is in, specifically for their lack of caffeinated franchise-y goodness. But now Starbucks is here, as well as a newly opened grocery department, and there can be much rejoicing!They frequently have just one employee working at this location and there's definitely a wait sometimes. I also think there might be some supply issues to work out as they were out of lemonade last week, which I rarely come across at other locations. BUT the barista who was working was super friendly and recommended I try strawberry juice (who knew they had that!!?) in the place of lemonade in my passion tea. She then made samples for myself and other patrons to try. Oh yum!!! It might be my new favorite summer treat. Starbucks- you rule, as usual!
3	Hidden little Starbucks inside Target. Always accurate with the special drink modifications I request. Small but busy. No seating but it's aside their target refreshment area where u can find ample seating.
3	Nothing fancy here, but very convenient if you happen to be shopping at Target. Obviously no drive through, but friendly service with a smile. Starbucks is as Starbucks does and I will be partaking again, as I do every time I visit this Target. My tea was perfect and hit the spot on a hot day.
