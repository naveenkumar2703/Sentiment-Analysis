5	Had my car repaired and they are very reasonable priced, honest and fixed the you car right the first time.  Awesome customer service and a great place to get any European car fixed.  I highly recommend them .
5	SKIP THE DEALER!!Hands down the best spot to take your European car for all service. My entire family takes our vehicles here. Here is why this group is the best.1. Honest2. Best prices3. Amazing customer service4. Quality work5. Rental cars from Hertz (hard to find with a non-dealer)They have done many things for me from oil changes to brake pad/rotor replacement. Truly won my business when Audi N. Scottsdale said all 4 brakes needed replacement, Sun Valley said only the fronts were needed now, also were $500 less. It also feels good to support a small business. Give em a call, ask for Barry!
5	I was fortunate enough to locate Sun Valley Imports on YELP as I didn't know where to take my car for service after moving the car from CA to AZ. What a great shop, honest, reliable, timely, and they fix it right the first time. My only complaint is the they are not closer to Goodyear, AZ, but it gets me to the other side of the Valley every now and then ;-)
5	Been using Sun Valley Imports for a few years now and they are by far the best service shop Ive ever been to.  Very personal service and everyone there is friendly and knowledgeable.  Never had to bring my car in twice for the same thing, they fix it right the first time and great prices.  If you happen to bring your car in be sure to speak to Barry hes the best!
5	Excellent or European Car Care and Repair. Forget the wheeler dealer. Sign up on their website for coupons. No spam. Courtesy car to and from while vehicle is being worked on. Staff is genuine and courteous. Shop is immaculate. Safety first no up selling. Varooom.
