3	Tons of shoes for women, some for men, zilch for kids.  Huge clearance section, but not all deals are really that great.  Good place to go if you're pretty self-serve and have a general idea of what shoes cost elsewhere.  Their rewards program is pretty generous- $10 back for every couple hundred you spend- not a hard limit to meet.
4	I love this store! They have some of the best prices and options for shoes in the city! They always have some great looking shoes, excellent brands, and spectacular prices. I also enjoy that the way this particular location is set up that there isn't "walls" of shoes like Payless or some other local shoe shops. This place has shelves that is one height and that is it so you can get a grand spectrum of all of the shoes in the store. It is in a great location in Greenway Station in Middleton and it is a very clean and good looking store. The only real qualm I have with the store is that 75% of the store is dedicated to Women's shoes. Which is fine but It would be nice to see a little but bigger selection for Men's shoes. Also their slippers are SUPER COMFY. One final thing is that they have some great coupons every so often here. Keep and eye out!
4	It's a DSW. Just like any of the other ones scattered about the country.+ Friendly, helpful staff+ Open, expansive+ Plenty of parking+ Fast check-outs+ Reasonable deals on most shoes+ Clearance racks have some great deals- Vanns shoes are *exactly* the same price as anywhere else, although signs lead you to believe you're saving money... I looked at a pair earlier in the day at a local skate shop, where they were $45 (MSRP according to Vanns site is $45). DSW had them priced at $44.95, with the sign indicating "Compare at $60 - Save $15"... - Accessories (socks, waterproofers, etc) are a bit pricier than other places, so watch those impulse buys while standing at the check-out lane.
