3	The business name suggests a cigar store, but it's more of a some shop with cigarettes and hookas as well as cigars.  I have gone twice only interested in their small selection of cigars.  They do have a walk in humidor, but it's one of the mallets I have seen.  If you are looking for cigars, thre are other places to try.  The only cigar reason o go is to see if they have anything of value on sale.
4	Huge selection of glass pipes and other smoking accessories. I am not a cigar smoker so I cannot comment on that, but this place isn't bad. Owner checked my ID twice, must have forgot, but at 30 I happily show my ID nowadays.
1	The selection of items was great.. ButI had turned 18 about a week before i went there and the man at the register noticed that. He started to talk about how if i were his son and i went into the smoke shop he would have kicked my ass I was getting a hookah pen, and that is not a proper talk to have with a customer i wish i could give a zero star rating
1	DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY AT THiS STORE! The guy who was there must've been the owner cause he was way too old to be working. He tried to sell me the most expensive e cig pen and wax/oil kit. My friends that purchased the same item spent less than $20, and he was trying to charge me $50. He kept pushing these items that I didn't even need. I showed him a pic of what I was looking for and he had the nerve to say that no one else would sell these items individually. I went down the street and spent $15! CONSUMER BEWARE! I wanted to give stars!
