5	Biz in a Boxx is an amazing product! This unique tool teaches children about the world of entrepreneurs and the steps to take to create and build a business. The owner and founder, Melissa Rose, takes this complex process and simplifies it for kids, with three levels of age appropriate versions. I liked the "CEO" level version so much, that I bought it for MYSELF to use!  I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to give their child a leg up in this economy and prepare them for a highly competitive business market. I also recommend "The CEO" version for adults who either have been thinking about building a business or are already in business and trying to get back on track.
5	I bought Biz In A Boxx twice.  Once for my son and once for a friend's son.  Both kids had incredible experiences with the product.  My friends son has the middle level and actually started a business online buying and selling rare Lego pieces!  He makes a transaction fee on each purchase and has made a small fortune!
5	Melissa Rose, the founder of Biz in a Boxx, is by far the smartest person I know. She saw what our kids were missing in education and planned for it. Biz in a Boxx is the sure way to assure that your children will succeed. This program helps your kids to understand what it takes to run and be successful in business. Today schools are not teaching this, so Biz in a Boxx becomes very important in your children's education. Help them help themselves, plus give yourself peace of mind. Make this part of your parenting tools, you will not regret it!
