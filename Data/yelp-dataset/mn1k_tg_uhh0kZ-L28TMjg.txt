5	I always love going to Mt. Charleston to get away from the urban jungle.  It's the perfect place to take a hike, have a picnic, or just relax.  There's a cute little restaurant, which always has stands outside with people selling hand-made crafts and jewelry. The lodge is very cute and quaint, and the perfect place to have a drink and get a little intimate with your date while enjoying a scenic and magnificent view of the mountains.  But my favorite thing to do is head up there w/ a honey, grab a picnic table, get a little fire going, maybe bbq, a bottle of wine and just enjoy!
4	Took a camping trip up at Lee Canyon which neighbors Mt. Charleston.  Checked into Camp Dolomite.This place was nice in Sept.  It was quiet.  There were almost no people there.  Our campsite was secluded and had a lot of privacy.  It was nestled down between 2 small hills....perfect.  There was no wind.  I've never had "no wind" when I've gone camping.  We took a hike...that was exhausting.  Watched a lot of birds, ate a lot of food, and got scared by a baby dear at 2am.    Camp Dolomite up at Mt.Charelston/Lee Canyon was a pleasant surprise, not your usual campgrounds where everyone is piled up on each other.  And the host was so very pleasant.  I will definitely make a trip up there the same time next year.I only give 4 because a lake/river would've made it perfect!
