5	Awesome Cafe / Bakery /  Pizzeria, Owners are great!
5	This is a very nice place with fresh, homemade food including salads, pizzas and yummy baked goods. I got some cookies and was really impressed by how "real" they were (like something my grandmother would have made). I'm going to have to hit them up for breakfast soon as they have what looks like a pretty good set up for coffee and espresso, and I'm certain they have some marvelous breakfast treats too!Updated 03/15/2012, sadly this place is now closed.
4	This little cafe is just up the street from my house so of course I had to give it a try. I stopped by a few weeks ago and ordered a turkey sandwich that was delicious. Last night the family and I tried their pizza. It was good, not to die for but better than chain pizza. To top it off they had a coupon in the savy shopper too so it was but on get one free! Can't beat that.
