3	This Jack in the Box is pretty good.  Fast service, clean restaurant, filled-to-the top shakes and drinks at the drive-through.  I like having this place close by for 24-hour American fast food.  The children I've seen inside have appeared happy, so they must have good toys and meals.  The chocolate milk shakes are the best!
1	Soooo slow....even the drive through
1	They get my order wrong every time
3	Can't beat the tacos in a pinch
1	The norm, food is so so....not my first choice!  I have honestly given this restaurant chain a burger taste. Simply can't go back...maybe they have other decent food but for burgers, ah I can forget it!!
1	This place is disturbing. It's dirty, sticky, greasy, and reeks of filth everywhere. And that's before any review of the food. You gotta be kidding!
