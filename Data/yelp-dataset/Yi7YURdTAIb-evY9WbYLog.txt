4	Talk about huge improvement!  I rarely say commercials are right, but in this case, they turn out to be true. Domino's has some great pizzas and menu items now. Try it.
5	I ordered two pizza's online went down 15 minutes later and picked them up. Servers were very courteous and friendly. Great job all around!
1	I love Dominos so I order for them before anyone but literally EVERY time we order, they forget something or mess something up. And best yet, when I emailed the "manager/owner", TWICE...I never once received a response. If it weren't for the fact that Dominos pizza is the best for us that's closeted, they have disappointed us too many times and we would not be ordering from them again if my husband didn't dislike the "competition". How hard is it to remember a side of icing or sauce?! I wouldn't mind if you didn't make me pay for them to begin with...
3	Domino's Pizza is nothing special, but it is not bad either. People seem to still consider this inexpensive pizza though, but it is far from that. I don't mind eating their pizza, but I wouldn't recommend it as being a good deal. There are several places that you can find better tasting pizza at for the same price.
5	Ordered on a special promo night, and the employees handled all the busyness and rude people well. Offered an extra deal when we had to wait for a few minutes longer and the pizzas turned out great.
5	Nick is a great store manager and gets the job done. He cares and goes beyond the call of duty to make sure the customer is served his pizzas and is satisfied. Thanks Nick for following through! You just got another loyal customer instead of my local Domino's store manager who has his head up his butt and won't return phone calls.
