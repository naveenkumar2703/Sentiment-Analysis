3	We went here today looking for some authentic Scotish cuisine and I was very impressed. The location is very good for those exploring Edinburghs old town and famous royal mile. The decor was a bit old skool with some tacky pictures on the wall but when the food arrived you will no longer notice them because our meal was delicious.
4	The Wee Windaes is great if you're looking for an alternative to the uber cool food establishments in Edinburgh.By that I don't mean that it is the dork of Edinburgh's restaurants or anything - far from it. It's got a great, solid menu that will rival many of Edinburgh's finest dining places, and is a firm favourite with the locals. It's got a really impressive seafood menu which includes the classic cullen skink but I am a sucker for Bangers and Mash, so I opted for that last time I was here. It was absolutely delicious and done to perfection. It's simple but one of their strongest and most popular options.The decor is staid and arguably a little dated but I quite like its charm. The way it looks reminds me of hotel dining rooms I used to visit in British seaside resorts when I was a kid. It looks like it's not changed in years but there's something comforting about that.My only complaint would be a small one - its opening hours. They serve food from 6-10 but sometimes I'm really craving a bangers and mash if I'm through for a gig and have done a shift of mad dancing. But that's a selfish demand and it's nice to pop in for a quiet, calming meal at dinnertime.Good old fashioned grub with a couple of fancy options. I like it.
