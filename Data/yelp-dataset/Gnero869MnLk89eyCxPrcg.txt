5	Robbie is my personal trainer at Las Sports Performance and I cannot believe the difference in my body. I had knee surgery over a year ago and went to my surgeons physical  therapist for months and  saw more improvement in two sessions with Rob than my entire experience with  my physical therapist. He evaluates where you are before he begins your work out and constantly changes your program and reevaluates what you need next. My vitality, strength , endurance and attitude has quickly improved.  I have never seen such a loss in my rear thighs and waist.  This is a life alternating  totally worth it investment.
5	This gym has provided me with the best experience I've ever had in the world of fitness. The trainers are attentive and innovative. My fitness level is constantly being evaluated and the training program evolving with me as I do. The equipment is top notch and the environment is the opposite of the big box gym....nobody taking selfies in the mirror or oiling their body or looking like they're about to hit the club, everybody is there to work and get fit!
5	What a great workout! This place may be geared towards athletes but the team could not have been friendlier or more helpful during our drop in to the Body Burn class on a Saturday morning. If you are lucky enough to live in Vegas and try this place, you'll be hooked. If you are just visiting like me, drop in and enjoy a customized workout at a very reasonable price (my class was just $20).
