1	I was not please this morning when I went to pick up a new blouse after the first time it was cleaned. It was a peachy-orange color when i dropped it off, and when I went to pick up, I noticed a WHITE sleeve sticking out of the middle of my order on the same blouse. They had not noticed that they had taken out the color entirely until I pointed it out, already a disappointment. When I pointed out that they had ruined the shirt, the dry-cleaner came up and checked the tag, said that it said dry clean and they had done that, and I should take it back to the store. There was not even an apology, she just said "we have no way of knowing if the die is going to wash out with the dry cleaning solvent." I would think a professional would notice all the color leaving a shirt they were cleaning. I will no longer trust my garments to an operation that does not seem to take any pride in their work. They did not charge me for the "cleaning" of the shirt, which does little to remedy the $150 down the drain.Furthermore, I am wearing a pair of pants that I picked up 2 days prior after having a clasp sewn back on, and it has already fallen off again. More wasted money.
1	Had a shirt taken to them to be serviced three times, and still they did not dry-clean it. I would hav been better off doing it myself in my sink at home.
5	This is a real, on site laundry. My husband's dress shirts haven't looked this nice since they came from the store. Mastel has actually removed a lot of collar/cuff dirt from 2yrs old shirts, it's amazing. The press job is uniform and neat, no puckered areas, no blobs of seared starch and they fold & press French Cuffs. A blouse I thought was ruined, they worked on it, the stain came out and no damage to the fabric. As for regular dry cleaning, my clothes no longer have repulsive chemical smell, yay!
