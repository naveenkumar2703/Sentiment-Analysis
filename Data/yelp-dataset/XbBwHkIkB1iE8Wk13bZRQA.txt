3	The staff here is always friendly and professional. If I'm using this location, it is generally for the ATM. Quick in and out through the drive through.. I have no complaints :)
4	This location is always so quick and easy. So it was no question when I had an issue with being overcharged for something I went into this branch. I was happy to only wait a few minutes when I was greeted by Brandon. I have to say he was so friendly and helpful. Before I knew it I was out of there and everything was fixed. Thanks again Brandon.
4	Getting refinance on my car. Great service ask for Shue  He is the best for your banking needs I got my higher interest cc transferred to a lower no annual fee and no transfer fee up to 2 months so I am saving 400 dollars each month.  I am a happy camper.
