5	Afterafter seeing another local doc for years with massive headaches and being treated with tylenol, I went to see doctor ahmad at pinnacle,  in 15 minutes she recognized something more serious was wrong, she had an appt for meThe next day at arizona neurological institute in sun city, 2 days later I had an mri which revealed a rather large tumor in my brain that turned out to be cancer, it was operable.Dr ahmad saved my life. After my brain surgery, she called me at intervals in my hospital room to check on me, she really cares about her patients, her staff is great too, they keep updated on my case and progress. Doc tells me im one of thier success stories and gives me hugs whenever she sees me.Her partner, dr harter is great too...I needed to be seen recently, doc ahmad was out of the office, doc harter had me come right in to see her.
1	Called to make an appointment and told the receptionist exactly what was happening.  She said they can help me and I made the appointment.  I got there at 1:10ish for a 1:20 appointment.  They didn't call me back until 2. Then when they finally did, the PA told me that they don't do what I'm there for. I explained that I told the receptionist why I'm there and her response was "The girl you spoke to is new and she was kinda left a lot for a week to fend for herself"......really?  I needed this test done and now I have to go somewhere for it. If you go here, make sure you are clear about what you need and maybe call back to make sure they do it. I gave up some much needed sleep for this appointment.
