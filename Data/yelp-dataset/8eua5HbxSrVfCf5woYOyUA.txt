4	Love Arby's. However a medium curly fries is allegedly 600(!) calories. So worth it though. 1 star off for their shakes being mediocre. They always seem to be pretty thin.
5	Damn You Chicken Tenders for being so tasty!
5	Excellent sandwiches even without sauce.. service has always been friendly and when the order came out wrong recently, I was handed the correct order with a sincere apology. Fast food restaurants rarely have staff who care enough to even offer an insincere apology, much less one that is sincere.. kudos!
