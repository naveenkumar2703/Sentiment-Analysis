4	After a long rainy day stuck inside I had worked up an appetite and it was time for another BBQ run.Being closest to my house Buckingham's made it 1st on my list.This place is in a great location right next door to the movie theater.As you enter you are greeted by a very friendly asian lady and a large dining area with boothes along the walls and western decor on the walls.They have quite a deisplay of trophies & plaques touting their accomplishments & merits.I ordered a pulled pork sandwich w/2 sides for $8- I also got horseradish cole slaw and mustard potato salad.This place is for real. Great smoky taste, the pork was slightly crunchy but very moist & tender. The BBQ sauce was spicy with some real zip to it.The cole slaw was the biggest surprise. Horseradish-very spicy but crunchy and delightful. The potato salad was incredible too.I saw an order of ribs and they looked like some of the best I've seen. I will be back to give them a try.For now I'm off to my next BBQ destination.........
2	I have been going to Buckinghams somewhat infrequently for the past 4 or 5 years. I suspect they have changed hands at some point because the quality and portion size has drastically dropped. LIke Mona C. I had gotten the combo place once and everything on it was dry. Not just overcooked dry, but turkey jerky dry. I liked the Bruswick Stew, but I have no idea if it was good or not having never had it before. With chains like Famous Daves and Memphis around, I wanted to give the 'little guy' a chance, but they have really disappointed me. The food isn't terrible, but it's not good. If you do find yourself there, try the fried pickles, you'll feel like Elvis.
