3	Oh, if only THE Gordon of Gordon Biersch could see this location....I think he would frown on the lack of garlic fries on the menu. All the GB classic plates are replaced with.... SANDWICHES? Who's restaurant is this? My frat boy brother's??? Seriously, sandwiches and beer makes me pretty much.... Drunk. Ordered a wich and a brew, and then complimented the sub-par food with a trip down to Chili's Too (ALSO in D terminal). Boo hiss. Three stars for the Martzen.
2	NO GARLIC FRIES?!?  BLASPHEMY!!!After exploring every nook and cranny of the D terminal searching for something remotely edible, I saw Gordon Biersch and my salivary glands immediately went into overdrive thinking about those sinfully good garlic fries.  So I pony up to the bar and....D E N I E D!They only serve pre-made sandwiches.  WEEEEEEAK!
