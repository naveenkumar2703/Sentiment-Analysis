5	Fast, affordable, good driver, solid music, clean car - great experience. Thank you!
5	This bus is awesome.I was with a really, really rowdy bunch... there were about 12 of us. 6 boys 6 girls, one stripper pole, one disco ball - need I say more?We arrived safely to our destination, and the driver was a great guy.
1	First this company had three drinks.  Cran and vodka, capt coke and bud lite in a can.  If you are 12 and have no idea what you like to drink this bus is for you.  If you have a preferred drink avoid this company at all cost.  They bring you to a few clubs and leave you at the last to fend for yourself.  The "bartender" acts like a drunk teenager and takes photos for his page.  Then as they drop you off they ask you to write a good review and tip them.  Here is a tip.  Get more drinks better music and more adult oriented bartenders.  I felt robbed of my $80.00.  I could have saved money staying in my hotels club.  If your just turning of age there are better ways to experience Vegas nightlife than the so called party bus.
5	I just wanted to say THANK YOU!!  I decided to go with LVPB the minute I talked to Junior... What a nice guy!  It was my daughters Sadie's dance and there was a few pick up and drop off's, for the kids and he totally worked with the schedule the kids were on, since he already had someone else booked he gave us a great deal and I'm all about customer service and they delivered! Thank you again!  Will definitely go with this company again!  The kids loved it!
1	1.5 hours late, then proceeded to lie to us about our actually reservation time being later to cover the fact that they oversold their schedule.
1	Horrible service.  To and from drivers changed every pickup/dropoff resulting in inconsistent pickup time/location. We had the bus for 3 nights.  Pickup was late one night and bus literally broke down the other.  Save yourself the hassle and money--stay far far away from this service.
