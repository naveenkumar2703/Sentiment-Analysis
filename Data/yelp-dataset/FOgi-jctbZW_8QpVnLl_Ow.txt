5	We love the Little Gym.  Our little gymsters can crawl around and play on mats and beams.  The laugh, they smile, oh and they shed a tear here and there.  Balls, sticks, bubbles, songs -- lots of activities to entertain infants!
5	I have been bringing my son here for 2 years.  Julie and the rest of the staff are incredible!  They really enhance the experience and take it to another level by offering a true caring and desire to see my son move forward and succeed.  These core strengths and values will be something that my son will use for years to come.  The Little Gym is great exercise for my son and provides him with an outlet and focus point.  Just a great all around place, we love it!!
5	What a great place for kids, the staff is friendly, fun loving and professional. Classes are interactive lively and fun.  Equipment and the facility are well maintained and super clean. Instructors are motivating and encouraging and take pride in teaching each child.  Parents get progress updates and information after each class. My Grand kids love the Lil Gym we'll be back for years.
