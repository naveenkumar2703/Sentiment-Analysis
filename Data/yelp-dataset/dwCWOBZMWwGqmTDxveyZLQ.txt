5	Have you ever had the feeling that you just wanted to get the F outta dodge... just leave it all behind and head to Spain or Thailand or Bermuda... and you pack your bags, you are looking and tickets, and then you realize "Shit, I don't have a passport!" Even worse is when you realize, "HOLY shit, I don't have a birth certificate!"So, you frantically search online and figure out that you need to get your birth certificate from Vital Records, but you sure as hell are not going to drive down there during the day when you work in Ahwatukee... we have all seen what downtown is like during the day... so you decide to order online...Okay... I'm going to stop this "hypothetical" tale and get to the point... using the online system AZ Vital Records utilizes (Vital Check) was extremely easy, efficient, and when I just received my birth certificate only 3 business days later, I am jumping with joy and could quite possibly burst out of my clothing at any given second. I don't even mind that it cost me $36 (I think that is really reasonable being that it is evidence of my citizenship in this country)Now, let's hope that the expedited passport service is as effective... then is will be hasta la vista, baby! Hypothetically, of course.
5	Clean bathroom, nice people, and no hassle.  I was in and out so I have no complaints.  This place is on a one way street so you may need to be patient when you look for the place...  It's not that bad but easy to spot.
5	Such a breeze.  I came the day after Christmas and received the document I needed in record time.  Including the walk from the parking lot, the entire visit took 8 minutes.  The inside could use a good power washing, it's dirty.  The parking can be a fiasco but if you call ahead there is a voice recording of a woman giving you 7 options on where to park nearby.
