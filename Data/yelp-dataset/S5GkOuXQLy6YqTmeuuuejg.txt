4	A bit pricy, but they keep a record of what you like so they can do it consistently. Seems to work well.  The girls are always friendly, and they usually offer you a bottle of water or a soda.I'm a regular at this point.  Coupons help, plus they have a punch card you can redeem when you fill it up.
1	Just spent 40 mins waiting after being told the wait was 20. They were taking other walk ins who I suppose hap appointments but who knows. This place needs adult supervision...won't be back.
4	Girls here do a pretty good job. I get a zero on my head so i know that doesnt require that much work. They are friendly. I always do the VIP just to get a hot towel on my face during the wash plus an extra shoulder massage at the end. Oh dont forget that you have a 32 inch tv right in front of you during your cut :-)
5	Have been coming here for years since they always do a good job, and keep track so they know exactly what I get. Today I had Alexa (?) cut my hair. She did a great job, making sure it was exactly as I wanted. After it was all done and I was walking in the parking lot, she came running out of Sport Clips after me. I had given her an extra $20 and she was nice enough to chase after me and return it - a class act. I will continue to come here for this kind of thoughtful service :)
5	Jessica did a great job and I Only had to wait 10 maybe 15 minutes.. Everyone was friendly and they even offered me a bottle of water. I must say, I will be back!
