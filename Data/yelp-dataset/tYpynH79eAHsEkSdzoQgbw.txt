4	Banana Republic is the most refined out of the four companies under GAP. With that being said, style comes at a premium. If you do not mind not having the most up to date items then BR Outlets are the way to go. I have bought a few suits from the outlets and they are the same as the ones in the regular retail stores. The only difference is the reduced price tag. The tailored fit styles are my favorite because they give a sleeker and more refined look. Purchased right off the rack has never looked so good. If you wait for their semi annual sales, a $300+ suit can be purchased for half the cost. I might not have a reason to wear suits that often, but I know I will be going out in style when I do.If suits are not part of your everyday attire; then maybe some dress shirts, slacks, khakis, jeans, sweaters or t-shirts are more appropriate. Even casual wear looks more dressed up when it comes from Banana.
2	Found a great dress, but when I was trying it on, the fitting room attendant opened the door on me (without knocking) and I had to slam it shut. Mind you, it was the same attendant who let me in that room less than 5 minutes before. No apology, nothing. They definitely need customer service training here.
4	I love this factory store! I found real cute work-wear at great prices! Lots of items range from 30% off to 70% off. I was very happy with the items that I bought.
