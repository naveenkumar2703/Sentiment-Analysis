5	The first word that comes to mind is YUMMY!  I am in this area every Wednesday and had been looking forward to eating here; last night I finally got the chance.  I had the Chicken Pesto Grilled Flatbread; great flavor at a great price.  The atmosphere is nice, very clean, with friendly and quick service.  I am already looking forward to trying the Peanut Butter Crunch and one of the many smoothies they offer!
4	Although my office is across the street and I've been there for years, this is the first time I visited.The decor inside is precious, reminded me of my honeymoon in Kauai with bamboo strips everywhere. Lots of bright,happy colors.I shared a Hawaiian Breeze w Splenda with the wife and our 7 yr old had Jetty Junior. We loved the drink - only 174 calories and very tasty.
3	The Chocolate Chiller smoothie is bomb.com! I love when they have their happy hour, where you buy one, get one free!
