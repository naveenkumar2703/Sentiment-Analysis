2	There's a Tesco Express at Fountainbridge that offers a wealth of variety for the local student population. The fresh sandwiches come in a vast range of unusual fillings, fillings I had no idea Tesco even offered. They have all the essentials and enough space to whisk around at a steady pace and get your weekly shopping done.I wish Holyrood's Tesco Express was more like theirs. They're like the Express that Tesco forgot, still packing sandwiches like Just Ham and Just Cheese. As a regular (and the Duke) it's embarassing. The aisles are narrow, there are pillars everywhere and they don't stock anywhere near what other Expresses and Metros in the near vicinity do. The fridges have the most random array of fresh meats and ready meals, the rice and pasta section is about two shelves big, woeful, just woeful.Given the amount of colleges, universities, offices and residential areas around, it beggars belief why they didn't buy a bigger space, or at least re-design the space they have.
3	It's just a wee supermarket so they don't have a great selection of fresh stuff but it's handy if you're having an impromptu picnic in Holyrood Park. I often pop in to grab ingredients for dinner as I pass it on my walk home from work. It's got a cash line outside, has a coffee machine (I haven't tried it) & fresh bakery items.  I can get the essentials here & it saves me a trek to a bigger store. Does what it says on the tin.
