5	I found Northwest driving school online and am glad that I did. Rich is an excellent instructor and was very patient in helping me learn and get over my fear of driving. He offered practical advice on improving my driving skills and I would definitely recommend him to anyone who wants to learn how to drive. Their customer oriented approach sets them apart!
5	Thanks to Rich, so I got my driver's license today.
5	A driving school couldn't be better than this one. They taught my son even though he has learning disabilities. He is an educated, safe driver now. They are awesome!
