4	Reasonably priced liquor/beer and wide selection.  Staff friendly and helpful.  They do NOT however carry kegs.
5	what can i say except....the word "discount" when it applies to alcohol just freaking rocks!!!
3	Let me say that I love this place.  Problem is, they are never open late enough and aren't really that inexpensive/discount.  Having said that, man do they have the booze!  I found Samuel Smith Nut Brown ale On Sale here just two weeks ago and have stopped there on many occasions for party essentials.  It never hurts that I can walk here either.  Give it a try!
3	Good selection, good prices, friendly staff.  This business is a Circle-K subsidiary.My only complaint is the number of people looking for day labor that loiter in the parking lot - They always try to approach my vehicle when I'm pulling in.  Annoying!
4	Closed - So sad!
