4	Not bad for a Taco Bell.   Like any Taco Bell around except the service.   The service is way above average.
3	Two parts to this review.  First, the store overall.  Very nice - the folks are quite pleasant and helpful.  Inside, it's well-kept and clean.  It's very convenient for me and an easy stop.  Very reliable for the standard Taco Bell fare when I have that hankerin'.Next - their new "breakfast".  I had a waffle taco.  I *love* breakfast, so I was excited to try this.  Blech.  While it wasn't horrible, it is no threat to McDonalds.  The eggs were few and crumbly.  The sausage was okay.  The waffle was too maple-flavored and overpowered the rest of the ingredients (no need for the syrup).  Overall, a disappointment.  It would be alright in a pinch, but I'd cross a busy street if there were a McDonalds (or Burger King... or Hardees...etc.) as an alternative.
