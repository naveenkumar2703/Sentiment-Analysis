3	It's hard to give a fast food place more than Three Stars, or A-Ok in Yelp-ese. But if I could, this Taco Bell would be Three a half Stars!The staff is very friendly and accessible, as is the franchisee who seems to be everywhere overseeing his business.  Nice!   When was the last time you were met and greeted by the restaurant owner?It's been nearly thirty years since I had my first taco, and like Glenn Bell I fell in love with this quasi Mexican food item. His invention of the hard shell taco was a game changer. The new healthier menu is major a improvement.  The salads are much betterThis restaurant is brand new.  Some seats even have cushions.  WOW!  They have some minor kinks to workout, such as the Pepsi all in one soda dispenser.  Like the Coke version, it makes everything taste like Dr Pepper.  So, if you are on the run for a quick taco or burrito, Taco Bell is still the placeEnjoy!
1	I arrived at this Taco Bell at noon.   Placed my order at 12:13pm and got my food at 12:33.  I came to try the new cool ranch taco and received  regular Doritos taco.   When I tried to tell the man (he looked like the manager) who have me my food he said "this looks like yours".  I said, "I ordered the cool ranch taco box".  He replied, "you want a box?".  I said forget it and walked away. When I sat down to eat my food, it seemed as though it had been sitting for awhile.  The bottoms of the tacos were soggy and falling apart and the food was cold.  Don't get me wrong, I have realistic expectations for fast food at Taco Bell but this was pretty horrible even by those standards.
3	Eh, it's Taco Bell, so expect fast food, chain restaurant Mexican that tastes like the price you paid for it. The staff here are friendly and are good at marking your items so that you don't get the "extra sour cream" burrito mixed up with your regular one.
