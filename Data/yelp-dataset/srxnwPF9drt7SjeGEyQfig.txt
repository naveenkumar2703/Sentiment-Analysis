5	Dr Pete is great. Our daughter was suffering from terrible ear infections. Even with tubes. Finally somebody told us to go see Dr Pete and since then our little girl has been ear infection free and her parents have been able to sleep at night once again. Thanks so much Dr Pete.
2	Don't go here unless you want an average chiropractic visit and then be victim to an unsolicited, all-out marketing campaign. I visited him a couple times about 18 months ago and all of the sudden I am receiving weekly spam emails, mailings to my house, and even had an automated telemarketer call my cell phone on his behalf. Extremely unprofessional and tacky to resort to telemarketing.
1	I was experiencing upper back pain that was interferring with my day to day activities.  I went to see Dr. Sutton hoping to get some relief that day. He yook xrays and told me he couldn't do any adjustments until he looked at the xrays the next day. He did offer to put the muscle stimulators on my back but that doesn't really help much.
1	What a waste. Stopped by 4 weeks ago and provided a copy of insurance card and drivers license. They were listed in the Humana booklet but wanted to make sure.The gal up front stated she will verify coverage and call back in 24-48 hours. She never called back.Although they were closer to home and "in network", after waiting 7 days,  decided to look elsewhere and found Advanced Neck and Back Pain on Ocotillo road. Even though they are 'not in network" they have been great. Have been going there for three weeks, and they are helping to prevent any additional costs other than normal co-pays. They offer Chiropractic care, Physical Therapy, and massage, all under one roof.If your looking for a highly regarded practice, check out all the reviews. That should help making your decision real easy. Plus they have Saturday hours. Ken
