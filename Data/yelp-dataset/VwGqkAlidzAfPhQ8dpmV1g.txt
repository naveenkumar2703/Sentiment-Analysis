5	The folks at Foothills Sports Medicine Physical Therapy are great!  Everyone is very knowledgeable and professional, yet they treat you like family.  I was a patient of theirs for five months while recovering from a broken shoulder and surgery.  My experience with the therapists and technicians is that they listened to me (and my body), and would push me just enough to get me where my body needed to be without overdoing it.  Collectively they have a great sense of humor, and are a really cohesive team.  The team was hugely instrumental in my recovery.  - W. R.
5	Great staff all around.  I have not been able to straighten or use my right arm for over a year.  I've had surgery and now in rehab - they have my arm 95 % straight in just a few weeks.  Very knowledgeable in what they do. Highly recommend them.
5	The staff is wonderful! The physical therapists are extremely knowledgeable and very easy to talk to. Everyone there makes each visit warm, inviting, and fun. I would truly recommend this environment to anyone that has to go through physical therapy.
