1	I really hate this place!! Came here and ate b fast today. Wanted to use my laptop here to do some work on the internet and i needed to plug in, they have free wifi here but no WORKING OUTLETS!!!! How ridiculous is that!  Dont come here to use your laptop or the free wifi!  The workers here dont take concerns seriously they didnt even care that i couldnt find an outlet even when i said i would never come back!!!what an embarassment!!!
4	I enjoyed a McDonald's breakfast here & the food tasted good considering its fast food. The food wasn't greasy and I actually enjoyed it. Always love the mocha frapp
4	This is close to my house and is open 24 hours a day so I come here allot. Its McDonalds what can I say fries and burgers. Lately I like coming here for breakfast and get pancakes with  iced coffee which I enjoy. They have dollar parfait's that are good. This location has two drive threw that get backed up sometimes. I'm sure most of you have had McDonalds and this location has all the same meals and burgers. The food is always good and seems to be fresh here and the workers are friendly also.
4	I never thought I'd see the day where I was reviewing a fast food chain.  But this place has a great breakfast with great service.I just recently found out that the Egg McMuffin can be ordered as an Egg WHITE McMuffin.  And the hot cakes...for fast food quality, 4 stars!And you can't beat the price.  I ordered and Egg white McMuffin, 3 hash browns, 1 biscuit, and 1 coffee for 11 bucks!Enjoy
2	My husband and I both had salads.  The lettuce was wilted, the carrots rubbery.  Very disappointing.  We picked this location bc it was close to where we were, but it's worth the extra drive to go somewhere else.
