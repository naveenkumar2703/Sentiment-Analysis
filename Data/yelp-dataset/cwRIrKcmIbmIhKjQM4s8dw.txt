5	I have been a patient of Dr. Suzie Su's for 3 years now and I can say she is dedicated, knowledgeable and very caring.. Her and her staff  are helpful and friendly.  I have since moved to NorCal and I still schedule my appts around my visits to LV.
1	This lady is anything but professional she talks like crazy even of her personal life with her assistants. I call 24 hr before my appointment to cancel  and she wanted to charge me 100$. Then I still went to her office and she didn't even do what it was suppose to be done. Personally I DON'T RECOMMEND HER!!!!
1	Sunshine Dental has excellent professional service,Dr Sue is one of the best I have encountered in 67 yrs of going to the dentist,HOWEVER she should relax her cancellation policy because it is ridiculously  stringent !!
