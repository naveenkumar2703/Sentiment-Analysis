4	Loved this place, especially the all-you-can-eat Taco Tuesday.  Unfortunately this location closed down, apparently.  The location in Silverado Ranch is still up and running, I believe.  But if you're in the North part of town and need something tasty, I recommend Alfonsos which is right up the street.
5	This is now a Roberto's Taco and no longer Los Burritos.The food is still good though! The entire place has been remodeled and its pretty much brand new. I always get the same thing. Carne Asada Fries, Carne Asada Burrito, and Menudo!
2	Dirty... Floors, tables, waste cans. Salsa bar was watered down and tasteless. Cashier was handling the food with her bare hands--patting the burrito shells on the grill and transferring the cooked food to the trays...seriously, this is a health violation. The food was good, but could have been better. I am not overly sensitive, but this was too much.
