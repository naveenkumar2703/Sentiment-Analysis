5	Absolutely great beers and ales! I must say that the Original Innis and Gunn is one of the best beers I've ever had!
4	I been on many beer tastings and have had the pleasure of drinking a (unreleased) Sherry Cask version of Innis & Gunn - besides their Oak Aged classic, Bitter & Twisted and Rum Cask varieties they have several ales (below 5%) and beers (above 5%) which are damn tasty! They have several more (exclusive) varieties like Spicy Rum and Irish Whiskey and you'd be hard pressed to find any those. Hopefully one day I will be able to taste these as well. They are as local a brewery as they come - based on Randolph Crescent in the West End they stick to their Edinburgh roots. Long may they brew!
4	I'm not a huge beer fan but these guys have converted me.  I had the opportuntity to taste a great selection of their brews and if I can say I'm a firm fan of the Scottish Pale Ale, the Olorosso finish (it's been finished in a Sherry Cask) and the Rum finish.I can't believe that the majority of their stock escapes our shores to the Canadian market, poor show Scots.  I'm sure as more folk get to try and love their beers the Scottish market share will increase (though Canadians do have geographical size on their side to be fair).
5	I visited the HQ of Innis & Gunn as part of a Yelp Event and we were treated to a bottle of one of the I&G Range which was great to try the Irish Whiskey infused version and I can heartily recommend it.We then went on to a tutored tasting of three of the rage of Innis & Gunn beers accompanied by cheeses from Mellis. Claire the host for the evening was extremely knowledgable of the beers in the range and made the evening an entertaining and educational one in equal measure.The tasting sessions are available for groups of 4 to 32 and would make a good introduction to people who may not have tried the Innis and Gunn range and enjoy it in the fine surroundings of the Randolph Crescent Town House.
