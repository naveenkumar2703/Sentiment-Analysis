4	This is one of the largest and most extensive FBOs I've ever been to in the country and they haven't let the size go to their head either.They offer up prompt, friendly and thorough service while smiling and enjoying the sunshine (or the shade in their gigantic shade hangar). Their facilities are second to none and the catering that I've received through them has been quite tasty. I really enjoy coming here despite the fact that it's in Phoenix.
2	0100 arrival for 150 gal of Jet A and a quick turn. Scruffy, unshaven CSA, dressed in ratty hooded sweatshirt did not project a professional image. When asked, there was no change available for a $20.00 bill for vending machine. Not the level of service expected from a high end FBO. We'll make another facility choice next time.
