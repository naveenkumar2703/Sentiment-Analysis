5	I love Taco Bell and probably eat here too much.  This is one of the best I have ever been to.  Service is super fast and everyone is really nice.  If you live on the west side, give this store a try.
4	Ok, I know it was a fast food but they have excellent service and ok fast food.  My hubby love Taco Bell, so we come here once in awhile.
5	Best Taco Bell in the west valley. Service is consistently fast and friendly. Food is good. Good job!
1	I dont understand how taco bell is still in business in AZ where there are hundreds of great mexican restaurants. Taco bell is garbage!
1	Do not go here. Awful people. Honestly, do you want to be replaced by iPads and robots?
