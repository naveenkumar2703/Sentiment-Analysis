5	I absolutely love this doctor and today was my first time meeting her. She was full of life and personality. I like my doctors to have a good bedside manner. I just moved here to Scottsdale a month ago from RI and I really liked my gyno back home and I really was hoping that I would find another one that I really liked. I appreciated the fact that before the actual exam we went into her office to talk about medical history and other questions and concerns. She actually eased my fears on some tests that I recently had done by an endocrinologist. I was referred to her by our realtor whose wife also sees Dr. Haas. So far I am very impressed by the doctors here.
5	My 91 year old aunt has been seeing doctor Haas for years, and this doctor has cared for her with compassion, wisdom (seems she knows when to watch and wait with informed decisions and when to move to more assertive treatment, getting my aunt through some tough times that other doctors were less patient with). I also really appreciate her knowledge and conservative approach to bio identical hormones, taking into account individual nuances and dosing (this from a conversation I had with her when taking my aunt in for an appt.)
