5	Great company of integrity. I would definitely buy another from them. They don't always have fancy cars on the lot but sometimes they get some really nice cars. I got a beautiful Acura that was only a few years old for $2500 under blue book. Whatever your budget is they will sell you a car that will run good for awhile for a fair price. Buy from them!
5	I just got home from purchasing a vehicle from them and the experience was so stress free! I got a great deal on a 2001 ford under bb! John (the owner) was extremely helpful and informative. I would be recommending this dealer to all my friends. I am a first time buyer and have been shopping around for a vehicle for the past 2 months and 1 stop here I was sold! I can't stress this enough, this place is great! :) Thank you John!
5	I bought my car here and couldn't not have asked for better customer service. John and Allen helped me find the exact car I was looking for. They even went above and beyond when they installed my hydrolic shocks on my hatchback for free. They have been nothing but courteous to me. And this is by far the best and nicest vehicle I have ever purchased. I will definitely be coming back to them when I purchase my next vehicle!!!
