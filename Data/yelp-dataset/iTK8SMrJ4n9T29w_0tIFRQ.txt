1	Do not rent a storage space from these people. They are thieves and every time I went to visit my storage unit my things were not in the same place where I left them. Plus my unit was very hot with terrible lighting. It gave me the creeps every time I had to go there.
1	I agree completely with the other review! I had half of my belonging stolen, and when I reported it to their in-house insurance company I was told that they only cover "Burglary" and they determined that what happened to my unit was theft, therefore it wasn't covered. I've been trying to get in touch with someone at the corporate office for the past 4 weeks and have not been able to get past the first tier customer service rep.
