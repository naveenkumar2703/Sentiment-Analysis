5	I love my dentist!  And, no, I'm not nuts!  As soon as you walk into Dr. Hogan's cute, sunny, clean office any apprehensions you may have about allowing someone to poke and prod in your mouth immediately wash away.  I've never had to wait more than 3 minutes to be called to the back for my appointment to begin and Dr. Hogan's dental hygenists are super gentle and efficient.  Dr. Hogan herself is lovely and so kind and professional.  She doesn't exude that preconceived "scary dentist" notion at all.  I really like going to a dentist's office that is small and offers personalized care without long lines and waits.  Kudos to her office manager for never giving me slack about my constantly changing schedule when I call, too!
5	I have severe anxiety about dentists and I recently had two great visits at Dr. Hogan's office.  My teeth cleaning went smoothly and Jennifer (who cleaned them) was gentle and thorough.  Dr. Hogan found that my childhood fillings were loose so I went back this week to get them filled in.  For the first time in my life, I prebooked my next appointment!  Dr. Hogan and her staff are very patient and kind.
5	Dr. Hogan is the best dentist ever!  She's a nice person and very gentle with your teeth, and not to mention honest.  I always get anxiety when I have to go to the dentist, but not with Dr. Hogan.  I have been with her for over 3 years now and will never change dentists.  My kids go there as well.  Everyone in the office is friendly and the office is always clean.
5	The staff so SO FRIENDLY!Dr Hogan is also very professional and considerate.  When she found unexpected decay underneath one of my fillings, she didn't try to "push" a crown on me.  She gave me three options with expected time frames for what I could expect with each option moving forward in regards to future work.  She also gave me adequate time to make the best decision for myself and also worked through her lunch hour to get my extra dental work done.  She is AWESOME!!
