5	Bad Moon's is a pretty far drive for me, but it's definitely worth it. The owner is very helpful and friendly. They have a good stock, and are always willing to restock or order something they are out of. This place by far has the best price on booster packs at $3.25 a pop. They are also the only location with boosters in stock from the last few sets including Shards and even farther back.Great place for FNM. They are always doing some kind of tournament or causal play. (EDH, standard, legacy)Much better than most of the gaming places I've been too. I would highly recommend this place. Make the drive! It's worth it!
5	Great staff and a good selection.  Especially friendly yo casual and EDH players.  It is a bit of a drive for me but it is worth the trip!
5	A great place to play, courteous and helpful staff that make them my number 1 stop for MTG
3	About an average shop mostly focused on Mtg with a very small selection of other products. The place looks run down but the employees were nice enough. If your looking for Mtg they should satisfy your needs.
