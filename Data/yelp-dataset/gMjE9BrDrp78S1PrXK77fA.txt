2	There was a time when a chain bagel shop opening in my town wouldn't have excited me much, but as I've stated in other reviews, there isn't much in the way of restaurants in Sun Prairie. And we didn't have a bagel shop, so I'll take what I can get. So with high hopes, I dashed out to Big Apple with my "store grand opening" coupon in hand. But much to my dismay, I discovered it was located in a gas station convenience store.But not just any gas station convenience store, it was sort of an upscale one with an America/highway theme. In addition to bagels, it had a little grocery and liquor store. Very weird. Anyway, being in a gas station, this Big Apple Xpress had a very limited menu. They had some tables, but who wants to eat at a convenience store?
3	I tried three different kinds of bagels from this store. Swiss Melt, Asiago Melt and Cinnamon. All three were very good, my husband and I fought over the cinnamon ones. (The cheese bagels were excellent for making sandwiches.)The price structure is a little weird, you have to pay attention or you might end up paying more than you expected as some bagels are considered 'premium' and so have an added charge. And yes, it is in a BP gas station, but a very clean gas station that also has hand-dipped ice cream.

3	Big Apple Bagels used to be located on McCoy Rd in that little shopping center by Blockbuster.  Then they went out of business.  The sign on their door at the time said "closed due to tough economic times."  About a year later they re-emerged inside their present location, a fancy pance gas station.  Just so everyone knows, before that fancy gas station was built on that piece of property, there used to be a big, beautiful farm house there.  It appeared to be built in the early 19th century and was surrounded by 100 year old oak trees.  I find that tidbit of information depressing every time I look at this new gas station, who by the way, has the highest gas prices in town.Relating specifically to the service, the employees are hit and miss.  The employees for the gas station and the bagel shop are interchangeable.  I've seen both groups covering both businesses.  There is one employee in particular who is my prickly little peach.  She wears 40 tons of black eye liner, a black choker, and a frown every day.  I'm pretty sure she's bipolar.  One day she's friendly, the next she is pelting you with insults that come flying out of her mouth at the speed of light and leave you with a million little paper cuts.    Their sandwiches are expensive, and very underwhelming.  I can do better at home.  Plus, they all act like they are being incredibly inconvenienced when you ask for a sandwich to be made.  Extra tip here:  Have a general idea what you want, because you will get the super heavy eye rolls and flying insults, (if prickly peach is working) when you appear to be undecided in any way.And please, please don't have any questions!!!    I've tried all the flavors of bagels, and cheddar is obviously the best, that's why I hoard them.  Someone call that show on A&E!!!!  They also have muffins, but they are just ok and again expensive.My advice is to run in there with your coat on, have a good idea what you want ahead of time, be clear when you order, pay for them, and hurry out.         In closing I will tell you a secret!!  If you go after 5pm the bagels are half priced!  Shhhhh!!
