4	As far as sandwiches places next to my house, this one is the best.
2	I'm totally disappointed. The sandwich was pretty boring. Although they get kudos for slicing the meat right in front of me. Otherwise, there's just nothing appetizing about their sandwiches.
3	Better than subway as far as quality of meats, bread, and vieggies.  The cost may be slightly more than subway, but I would choose Port of Subs because the food is better.  I like that the meat and cheese is sliced right when you order it.  I spent about 8 dollars on a sub, drink, and chips which isn't that bad.  If I want to go with a better option I would choose Capriotis, but I have to be willing to pay more for higher quality.  Service was pretty good and the place was clean and neat.
2	I've always enjoyed Port of Subs, but this place needs an overhaul.  Although it was clean, my sandwich had a taste of Pine Sol or some cleaning product.  My guess is that the counter-top where they made my sandwich had been cleaned with some sort of cleaner, I ended up throwing the sandwich away....
5	We ordered trays for a party online. Within 30 seconds I received a phone call confirming my order and they also were nice enough to let me know that I ordered items that already came with my sandwiches. They were personal, professional, and respectful. I would order from them anytime! Thank you so much!!!
4	it's port of subs, what else can I say. If your looking for a good sandwich that is better than subway then this is a good option. The bread tastes better and the quality of the meats and cheeses are superior. The price is similar to subway maybe a few cents more but worth it.
