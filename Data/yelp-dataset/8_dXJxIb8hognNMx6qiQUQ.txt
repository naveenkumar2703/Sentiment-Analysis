5	I discovered Takashi Murakami in 2008 when he had a spectacular show at MOCA in Los Angeles. I'm not sure what drew me to his work, but something resonated and I've followed him ever since.My husband and I were thrilled to find the MLG had a collection of Murakami pieces when we were in Vegas a couple of years ago. We spent quite a bit of time admiring the work and daydreaming about owning a piece "one day". The sales people were informative without being pushy and we felt comfortable lingering and admiring the art.Well, that "one day" came in May of 2014! We were in town celebrating 32 years together (and 2 days of being officially, legally married) and decided to splurge on something to commemorate our new legal status.We purchased a signed and numbered offset lithograph of Murakami's "As the interdimensional waves run through ..." and we couldn't be happier! Susan Van Cleave helped us with the purchase. She had an assistant take the piece into a viewing room for us to examine. She answered all our questions and arranged shipping, etc ... She offered us wine, beer, champagne, etc, but we were too freaked out to ask for anything. We walked out with goosebumps running all up and down our arms and the back of our necks. We just bought a MURAKAMI!A couple of weeks later we got our artwork delivered and it is gorgeous. It was packaged in an enormous plywood crate with more bubble-wrap than you could ever want to pop, so the artwork made it here safe and sound. It came with all the appropriate paperwork, the certificate of authenticity, etc ...We are very happy with the Martin Lawrence Gallery and look forward to purchasing another piece there next time we are in Vegas!
