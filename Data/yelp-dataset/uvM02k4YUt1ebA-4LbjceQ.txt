4	I wasn't planning on buying, but could NOT RESIST that gorgeous LBD!  What a fun store.  I will be looking for this brand again.
4	Vacationing and shopping go hand in hand for me. I don't shop at Cache on a regular bases but the cute clothes being displayed drew me in with Hub in tow. (sorry babe)Hubs showed me a pair of skinny jean capris with buttons going up the sides of the pant leg, cute and practical. The sale associates were both very nice and helped me pick out the correct size. Since it fit perfectly and looked great, I purchased them in white and dark denim blue. The lady that helped me was also the cashier had given me a $25.00 discount (total score and validated buying two pairs).The store was very well organized, fully stocked and had a nice selection to chose from. It was better than the locations that I have visted before. I will check out their website to see the full array of attire that they offer.Only draw back is that the prices are a bit high, other than that it was nice.
5	Chris and her crew were amazing! My friend and I bought out the whole store! The gorgeous asian woman, and the tall girl with the ivory skin were so nice and made us feel like models on the catwalk. Can't wait to come back. Loved the pumps in the dressing room to make our bods look even better with the fun outfits. Felt like we were on rodeo drive. Can't wait to come back in September and see my new friends.
