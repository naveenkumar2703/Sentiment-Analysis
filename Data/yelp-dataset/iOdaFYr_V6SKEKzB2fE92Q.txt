1	Do we have a complete lack of intelligence here? It's not rocket science.I was totally unimpressed with this location, but I did end up with a GREAT funny story to re-tell over and over. Math is not the strength of our future youth that work here, tried to explain twice and still got no where.I hope you have better luck... and maybe better review of this dive
3	I never get food here, I always just get drinks. Never had a problem with service or waits. Can't comment on food though.
1	I would not recommend this Sonic to anyone. I have only been here twice, but both times it was bad. The first time my hamburger was served on a stale bun with the meat over cooked. The next visit my onion rings were all in a clump and under cooked. Please stay away.
