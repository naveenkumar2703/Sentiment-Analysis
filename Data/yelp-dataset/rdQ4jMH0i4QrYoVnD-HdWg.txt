3	Always a great haircut from Anna. Have tried haircuts from other girls here and they just can't do a proper fade. Hence the reason for 3 stars. You'd think that more than one person in this joint could cut my hair properly... Anna, however, gets 5 stars she's great.
3	I would have given 4 stars but I got there at 10 when they opened and no one was home. 5 minutes later an employee showed up, went in and left all 4 of waiting outside for another 5 minutes. The haircut was good enough. I'd go back.
4	I got a pretty sharp haircut here, which is a big compliment provided that I am pretty picky about my barbers.  With a $2 military discount, it only comes out to $13.  The wait wasn't too long either.
3	Good cut.  Took her time.
