2	One of the worse experiences I've had at Bath and Body Works. First of all, the store reeked of their new fragrance when I walked through the doors. I was in the store for five minutes and my clothes lingered with that scent. In addition, the scent was so strong that I got a headache. Ouch.Yeah, I like Bath and Body Works stores, but there was  way too much body spray or perfume around that entrance door!I still like the Mango Mandarin and the Pumpkin lotions at Bath and Body Works.
4	Wallflowers.  2 for $5 Brown sugar and Fig.  Don't judge me.
5	I love there products!  This is my favorite location, they are always so friendly.  No matter how busy they are you are never ignored.  I love there sales and the coupons I get in the mail. Yes the store has strong scents but duh that's why your there, my favorite are the floral scents.
4	Stopped in with a friend of mine on a busy night. Even though busy, we were greeted and helped by a very friendly sales associate. The store was kept neat and tidy, especially considering it's the holiday shopping season. I would definitely visit this location again.
