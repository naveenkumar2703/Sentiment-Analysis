5	I can only imagine how tough it must be to be in a warzone, but it's nice to see a business supplying goods which the army generally don't.The collection of supplies is massive, every single live saving items for all your nightmare scenarios (which unfortunately some people have to work in). Sleeping bags, tents, first aid, watches and some knives that are more like swords. They also supply Blood patches which is rarity in most survival stores.Everything is really cheap, I would imagine some smaller items are nearly at cost price. Don't go to Tiso, come here.
4	This is more of a general outdoor store than a traditional army surplus: i.e. a good place to buy a rucksack, not such a good place to find a military jacket.  They have a reasonable range of hiking gear and camping equipment as well as many complicated pocket knives and other boyish toys.Staff are helpful, and everything I bought here seemed to be good and durable quality.  It's a decent alternative to all the chain outdoor shops in town such as Millets and Blacks, as it stocks a slightly different range of brands, and the prices are comparable for most things.  I think they do also have slightly more specialist and heavy duty gear.  All in all, if you're about to venture into the wilds of Scotland (or beyond), Leith Army Stores is a sensible place to equip yourself before you go.
4	This is the home of all the hard core survival accessories, but don't let it put you off because you do get a lot of useful and handy camping gear from here.The great thing about the items from here is that they never let you down.  Go elsewhere and you can buy waterproof matches that will work just so long as they don't get too wet whereas here you get a lighting stick - these never go wrong.What you are buying is reliable items that don't let you down, but because they are also simple in design they're unlikely to be that expensive either.  Great for all campers if only so they can light a fire on wet days.
