4	Never had a funner barber experienceBlade Masters provided an original old school barber experience.  Really- jokes, laughs, great conversation, and quality hair cutting filled the spacious shop.  I felt like I stepped back in time when I saw the card table with dominoes at the comfy waiting area.  Folks were there to simply visit, which I loved-lets you know that this business treats every customer like a member of the "circle"Payed a visit to Vegas and needed to cut my locks off, found Blade Masters on a google search and dropped in.  Was attended to instantly, enjoyed the music and surrounding conversations so much I honestly didn't want to leave so soon.  Freaked out a little when baby boy whipped out the shaving blade-never had my edges cleaned up with shaving cream and a blade, @that point I decided I would be back to Blade Masters anytime I was in Las Vegas whether I need a hair cut or eyebrow arch...yes, they do eye brows!
5	Been coming here for 13 yrs! The gentlemen here take their job very serious! Very friendly atmosphere & customers from all walks of life are welcomed.  No rushed haircuts here.  The barbers treat each customer's haircut as if they're working on a painting or sculpture.  Various topics of conversation fill the shop. From one end to the next you'll hear customers & the barbers discussing politics, sports & current events. For the younger cats, this is a place to pick up invaluable information & just knowledge you can't get elsewhere. The older folks of the community are always treated respectfully as soon as they walk through the door. Come on through & you'll see what I'm talking about!
