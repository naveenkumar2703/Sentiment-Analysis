5	I started going to Rejuvena since 2007, and regret that I have not wrote a review sooner. It was called something else at the time, but they still have the same WONDERFUL staff. I don't even use a primary care physician anymore, because I trust Dr. Jain with all of my medical concerns. Intentionally, I began going there for laser tattoo & hair removal, and eventually kept going for IV Nutrient & Detoxification Therapy. I have referred Dr. Jain to several friends who also see him regularly now. I believe in his practices so much that I even did a segment on Fox10 News. You can view the interview at this link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=3XPy8Vv6y1Q I cannot go without mentioning the women of his office either. I have booked organic facials just so I could visit with Kimberly, who was my laser technician, and who I now consider a friend. Sadly, I have moved from Arizona, but I will go back to Scottsdale for work. I will most certainly schedule office visits during those times.
