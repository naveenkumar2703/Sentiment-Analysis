1	This was supposed to be a musical review of the famous "Rat Pack" of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis and Joey Bishop that played together in the 1960's. There were four male singers dressed and made up to represent the singers BUT their singing was terrible and amateurish. They even forgot the lyrics to several songs and were forced to make up words. The orchestra was off key frequently and I kept wondering why there was an empty front row seat in the brass section. All in all it was not a professional show and certainly not worth the ticket price.
4	We were at the Rio and looking for a show. It was expensive but worth it mostly. The look-alikes were very good. I think our Joey Bishop was a stand-in and he was okay, but not as good as the other Trio. Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra were pretty impressive. Although their voices were good, they weren't perfect of course. So don't expect perfection, just a trip down memory lane.I particularly enjoyed the Marilyn Monroe look-alike. I thought she was very good and entertaining. All in all, if you enjoyed the original rat pack, you will probably appreciate this show.
5	AWESOME!!! this show gave us a bit of History of what took place in Las Vegas.. From the songs I heard on the radio to these guys singing they sound so close to the Original Rat Pack. So worth seeing.
4	Being a Dean Martin fan, I had to see The Rat Pack is Back at the Rio.  I recommend upgrading to the table seating so you have that feel of "being there", or what I like to imagine it may have been like.  "Dean" and "Frank" were good.  I think that "Sammy" also dances in the Michael Jackson show because there were a few times I thought the softshoe would become the moon walk.  "Joey" was dead on.  I'd go again.
