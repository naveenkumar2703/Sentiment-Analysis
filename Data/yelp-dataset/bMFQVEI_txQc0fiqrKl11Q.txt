4	So I occasionally will venture into a new spot and in the West Valley this happens more because the options are slim unless you love the usual suburb destinations.There is a good bar next door, Augies, that I frequent but today I noticed a new place that had exactly what I wanted, hot wings! The staff (all two of them) were very polite and introduced their menu which consisted of mainly wings and a few other items like fries and Fried Okra.  I ordered a few different types of seasonings and off I went home and devoured these awesome wings.  I would recommend you order take out since the options are very limited to wings and the location isn't necessarily anything you want to write home about. Pricing is pretty consistent to wings at the usual pizza shop so yes it can be a bit pricey.I hope it can survive this bad shopping center, looking forward to coming back.
5	Love their garlic Parmesan wings the wings are really good and very friendly staff check them out new restaurant in the area all wings yummy!!!
3	The service was good. The food was hot but the wing sauce (traditional hot) was not what I hoped for. I will try another flavor and see how it goes.
5	Great wings, amazing honey biscuits! A great local wing place that ya gotta check out! Dine in or order it to go. The staff is friendly and welcoming.
