5	John is an amazing massage therapist! I have had several massages & his ranks to the top :)  He is very professional, hard worker, & has amazing hands!  He came to our home ontime & set everything up. I would completely recommend him as a massage person to use. Definitely has a passion for what he does! Thanks John!
5	John is a really personable therapist and cares about his clients! I like working with John, especially, because he comes to your home...so you don't have to drive your totally relaxed ""NOODLE" body home:} You will feel terrific!
5	Love John and all he has done for me, my family and people we've referred to him.  Professional, consistent and someone I know I can trust.  You cannot put a price on quality customer service and expertise in his field.  Enjoy your massage in the luxury of your own home and feel like you're at a spa.   Thanks John!
