3	Painted Mountain is a great value for golf.  It's not the greatest course, but it's got enough challenges to keep it interesting, a beautiful layout, and it has something for players of any skill level.  All for a great price.The only complaint I have about Painted Mountain--and this would probably turn away many golfers--is that they don't have a driving range.  That means you tee off cold on the first hole, and the first hole is a 600 yard dogleg around a lake, and the most difficult hole on the course.  It's an intimidating start, but don't worry, it gets easier.
2	Painted Mt I want to like you, I really do.  The rates are great, that is worth a star, the course is clean an kept up, that is worth another star. The first hole is a long par 5, it sets up really bad karma for the whole game. A lot of the tee times are very close together, this causes a weird bottle neck and pissy golfers.  It is a great course to go get a round in, but don't expect more and you won't be let down.
1	If you're showing up to get in a few swings on an off day afternoon, it's not bad for the price.  The course is below average and if you need anything from the staff, you most likely won't get it. Fact is, they are poorly run and need to learn a thing or two about taking care of their customers.   Most recently, we stood waiting to tee off for 45 minutes due to having no carts.  There must have been 8 foursomes looking for a cart.  They clearly over booked.  The only thing they did well was refund my money so that I could leave.
