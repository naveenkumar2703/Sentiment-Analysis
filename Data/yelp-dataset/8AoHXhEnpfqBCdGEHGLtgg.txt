4	good sandwich's good prices...i dont understand why they keep going out of business
3	A very regular Quizno's. The service was pretty standard. I'm not typically a big fan of Quizno's food, but I had a coupon, so that was a determining factor in coming here for lunch. I tried the Buffalo Chicken sandwich and it was pretty tasty. Overall, a vey regular experience for Quizno's.
4	A review for Quiznos!? Why not.  We came here with a group of 7 in the middle of the lunch hour madness which might have seemed a little too overwhelming for the staff because they kind of messed up on some of the orders, only slightly.  One order asked for no mushrooms but they included them, luckily it wasn't an allergy reason and just by choice but could have been a disaster. Another order was mistakenly taken by someone else and Quiznos temporary ran out of the ingredients to make the sub.  No problem they were awesome and started giving us free stuff to make up for it.Seeing that all I saw on TV about Quiznos was their commercials for their lobster and seafood salad subs I had to try it. I really liked it might even order it again.  The lobster and seafood salad was literally spilling out of my sub because it was so overfilled. They hooked it up by giving a few of us free drinks or snacks.  They also hooked it up by giving one of us an extra FREE large sub with triple orders of all meats.  The sub was ridiculously HUGE and tasty looking.They were fast, friendly, and clean. They treated us way better than what you'd expected from a typical chain and did everything to make sure we would come back.Next time I'm here I really want to try this chicken sub, the picture was on all of the tables and it looked good.
3	it is fine, nothing special. service was ok not great, had to ask twice for mushrooms on grilled flat bread sandwich.
