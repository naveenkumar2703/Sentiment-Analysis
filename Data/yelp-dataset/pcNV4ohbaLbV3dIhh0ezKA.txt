4	Friendly staff and Thrifty Ice cream make this a great place to fill up your water jugs.I love their ice, so clean and clear.  They also carry the 5 gallon water jugs with the built in handle, I have purchased a couple of them and they are the best.
4	We decided for dessert after having lunch in the area. Found Water N Ice on Yelp and headed over. I was extremely skeptical when I walked in. The place is very old and doesn't look too clean. Walls are a little rusty and things are kind of scary looking. But I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. I opted for one scoop of their chocolate almond ice cream in a sugar cone. It was really good and I'm sure I will be back.
4	This water and ice is not the newest looking and don't look too clean but ice cream is great, will come back again. Recommended.
4	I'm very happy this place is in my neighborhood. Their water tastes great. They are open, it seems, all the time. Even some holidays, if I remember right. Good ole Thrifty ice cream and a smiling face too. Family owned. Beats a dirty old machine. Any day
