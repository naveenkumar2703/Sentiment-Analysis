1	I brought my ninja in for service, and some valve adjusting, when I left my bike barely drove, so I called and came back the next day, they wanted my bike overnight, acused me of the problem, then finally fixed it after me being quite persistant. It gets worse, I let them change my oil after them persisting and giving it to me on a discount, well they did one of two things - A) didn't lube the inside ring of the oil filter or B) torqued the filter so hard no fitting can take it off, even a screwdriver punched through it can not take it off   - wasn't worth the discount now that my bike has been down and out for 2 days now - I would not suggest them to any real rider
