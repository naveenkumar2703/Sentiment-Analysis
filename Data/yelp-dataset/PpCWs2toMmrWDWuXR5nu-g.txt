4	My BF spotted this place a month ago but never stopped in. We were in the area the other day and decided to stop in and look at the menu. We ended up dining in and I had the Bacon Avocado Burger Combo (fries and drink included) and BF had the Rib Eye Steak Dinner. The burger was big and fries were golden and crispy.. yum! I didn't taste the steak, but it came with a side salad, veges, toast, and choice of baked potato or fries for $9.99. Prices aren't bad. We'll be back to try more of their items.
5	Tom's is awesome. That's all there is to it. There is NO burger like a Southern California Style Burger. All these restaurants are family owned by Greeks and man do they have the recipe for burgers!!! From the best bread (especially made for them), to the meat (also ground for them and spiced like no other) to the construction of the burger!!! The fries are so delicious (even cold no kiddin') and the orders are huge!
5	The greek salad is very good! It will run you about 9 bucks if you want chicken on it, you do get alot for your money though!it also comes with some amazing pita bread i love to dip into my leftover dressing!
5	I finally found it!!!!A mom and pop burger joint in las vegas that absolutely kills it.My favorite restaurants on the fast food side of things are local joints similar to what I grew up with in Pasadena, CA.This place has all the right elements to match up with any of those places in socal and is much needed here in vegas.  The kitchen has a huge glass window facing right into the dining room, and everything was super clean.  It also has a drive through!The menu is extensive with things like homemade croissant sandwiches and breakfast burritos for breakfast.  Along with carne asada burritos and gyros for lunch and dinner.I got the chili cheese fries and a pastrami cheese burger, because how a place does these two items is a make or break deal for me.They were spectacular.  The chili was beanless, with crispy fries.  The cheese was a  nice light cheddar blend on top not aged too much to dominate the dish.The pastrami was a little thick for what I am used to, but the charbroiled cheeseburger it came on and the fresh tomato, onion, and lettuce with thousand island dressing was perfect. The combination was excellent.I am so stoked las vegas finally has a place like this, and it's open till 11PM.  I will be eating here a lot.Give this place a try if you're considering going to five guys, in and out, or fatburger, you won't be disappointed.........  I gotta try one of their breakfast burritos next.
4	What a nice surprise Tom's was for me today. I had driven by it several times but today was the first time I had the chance to stop. I was unsure going in what I would take away from my experience. There are Tom's in my home town (or similar places at least). Those places are hit and miss. Sometimes great food. Sometimes average. Other times substandard. Mega Tom's though, brilliant. Courteous and professional staff. A clean restaurant. Awesome food. I got a pastrami burger and fries. I was shocked at how big the burger was. One of the biggest I have had. It was very filling. It was fesh too. No heat lamps here. The fries were great too. Thick cut and tender. A little bit of malt vinegar is the only thing that could make those fried potatos better. I'll be sure to come back again.
3	Interesting variety of food.Good tasting, and a nice stop when you've been driving a few hours from LA to Vegas.
4	Very good burger, fries were good and the deep fried mushrooms were awesome. And let's not forget great prices, service on the other hand wasn't very pleasant.
4	You know a place where you can get a steak dinner or a french toast breakfast with actual eggs at a drive thru? Now you do. Mega Tom's Burgers offers inside seating as well as one of the better drive thrus.  Better not just because you can get the full menu and the food is good, but also because they don't often make mistakes. The only complaint I have is that the owner gave me a discount card when they first opened.  It has become so difficult to get them to honor it over the past few months that I gave up trying.  Typically, that would be cause for me to stop using a place, but I can see the owner is trying. I know the economy is making it difficult. They lowered their prices which I thought were good anyway. So, I save myself the frustration and I don't try to use the card. It might expire at the end of the year, which is at the end of this month anyway.  At least it is just the end of the year and the card and not the end of the world which so many thought would happen on the 21st. For me the 21st was the end of school, which meant the beginning of vacation and freedom. So take that you Mayans! Back to Tom's. The food is good.  For 10 bucks, you can get a full dinner.  They even ask how you want your steak cooked.  I love the steak and egg sandwich.  I'm partial to the pork chop dinner - 3 chops which is a crazy good deal, with baked potato or fries, veg, and a legit salad.  Better than McGarbage right? I like the fired chicken, but it needs more chicken.  Now, I'm just being spoiled I guess,It's a drive thru and you're thinking junk or meat, but do treat yourself to a salad.  Really fantastic.  i've had the chicken and the tuna. They are huge and delicious.  The pastrami is also good, but too spicy for me, cause I'm a food wimp. There, i've admitted it!
2	I usually like this place, but after the weekend, I am rethinking this place.  I had the zucchini sticks, when I bit into one of them, it was gooey and gross, the pastrami sandiwch made both me and my husband sick, I was physically ill all through the night, to the point where I almost wanted to make myself retch.  The burgers are usually really good though, and the chili cheese fries are good as well.  The mexican food....not so good at all, I wouldnt even bother trying it, didnt do it for me.  This place used to be so much better, if they want to keep their customers, they need to step it up.  They may not expect me so soon to return!
5	I am originally for a suburb of Los Angleles called Carson,  where they had some of the best small Mom & Pop short order burger joints,...... Apollos, Carson Burgers, Ted's Burgers and Yellow Basket and more along those lines another place pretty famous called Tommy's Burgers or as the locals call it, "Tommy's"When this place opened up the smell reminded me of being back home so I ordered a double cheeseburger combo with fried zucchini and instantly was taken back.An extra large menu choice with great prices, so if your headed west on Lake Mead Blvd maybe to do some bowling at the Texas or just heading out to the Wal-mart, make a quick stop here and get your grind on.
5	Went there as part of a Meet-up.  Great tasting burgers, really good pastrami.  Great employees...clean.  Meet up was made up of nice people so we hung out a long time and not rushed.
5	I'm from south central LA and  I've been looking for a burger joint like the ones that you would find back home.  There is one called "TOMS" right on MLK and Figueroa and it has always had bomb food. I can name soo many more burger joints back home but neccessary when:I finally found one just like at home, there burgers have this smell and taste that is so unique.  One bite into one of these bad boys and you can't stop until it's disappeaerd.  Thank you Mega Toms, each visit is like going back home.  Your food is the bomb!!!!!
5	I don't know how they do it, but they manage to cram a ton of beefyness flavor into that patty. It is perfectly seasoned, wonderful bun, and very filling. They offer many other dished besides burgers, such as mediterranean, pasta, mexican, breakfast food including omelettes, and sandwhiches. All at a very reasonable price.
4	Great Burgers and more. Found this lil diamond in the  rough... totally hooked. If you don't know what to order, get the Pastrami Burger.... freakin' fantastic burger.
2	Got lunch here today on advice of coworkers. Came in with high expectations, but left genuinely disappointed. Couple things I liked about Tom's:- Clean- Got to see 30 minutes worth of Mars Needs Mom on their wide screen TVs- Serves jamaica and horchataThat said, felt that the cheeseburger combo was a little overpriced. Maybe because they cook it fresh or because they use the word "gourmet" on the front door to describe their food, point is I can deal with the price if only the burger wasn't a little on the bland side. Bigger complaint were that the fries were soft/limp like they were not cooked enough. The only crisp fries were overcooked. Paid extra for jamaica but warned no free refills. Last issue I kind of understand, but due to the first two points I feel like mentioning it (plus symmetry).Then again why trust me? I prefer McDonald's fries over In-n-Out's fresh cuts (most of the time) so my opinion shouldn't amount to much.
4	Hungry for lunch during a recent trip to Vegas, I found this place using the Yelp App.  It's not in a good area of Las Vegas, but it is relatively new in a nice building.  After browsing the menu and chatting with the talkative cashier, I decided to order the Double Bacon Cheeseburger combo w/Fries and Large Soda, $9.93.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mega-toms-burgers-north-las-vegas?select=zHrIN1vHvJqa4HaSS9z5nw#zHrIN1vHvJqa4HaSS9z5nwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mega-toms-burgers-north-las-vegas?select=KqWlebWdZjsGJ7JyAnoMNg#KqWlebWdZjsGJ7JyAnoMNgIt took a little while for them to make the Burger, which is a good sign.  They brought it out to my table and I dug into it.  The Burger was pretty good, not bad.  Fries were OK.  Overall, I'd rate it 3.5 Stars but I'm rounding up because of the friendly staff here.  They were all pretty cool and helpful.  I'd come back to try their Mega Burger...wasn't that hungry that day.Return Factor - 80%
4	Went here for lunch on a weekend. Definitely not the greatest part of town but nothing to fear. I'm from Los Angeles so my needs and expectations for a beefy pastrami and smothered chili cheese fries were high. We went to the drive thru and checked out the menu for a bit. We got the a hamburger, pastrami (with extra mustard and pickles) with an order of chili cheese fries all under $20. When we finally started to eat and I must say the chili cheese fries reminded me of home. The pastrami had nice flavor but little meat and they didn't add my extra mustard and pickles like I requested, bummer! The hamburger was simple but flavorful and not overwhelming. Hit the spot ;)
4	This place is really good I have been driving past it so many times and finally I went in. I ordered the avocado burger I was really big and tasty. The order took some time, but it was well worth the wait. I will be going back soon to try other items on the menu.
4	Went here for lunch today because I pass by it on my way to and from work.  The place was a little busy and it was clean and presentable. As for the menu, there was so much to choose from.  From burgers to egg sandwiches to tacos to fish and chips.  I ordered the charbroiled chicken supreme without bacon combo meal, to go. Pleasantly surprised!!! The quality of the food was better than expected. The fries were PERFECTLY cooked and crispy. A generous amount was in the bag. The chicken was well seasoned and cooked properly. The sandwich comes with avocado and Man did it come with avocado!!!! I love avocados and was expecting a couple of slices like most places would serve but it seemed like it came with an entire avocado. Thick piece of tomato. The bun was warm as well. Also, I asked alot of questions when I got there and the staff was very pleasant and seemed to really like their jobs which makes a difference in how you are being served. Very friendly and helpful. Offered me refills and didn't charge. I will def go back and tell my friends!!!
5	Straight out of Cali and family owned. This location was originally built to be a Dunkin' Donuts, but DD never opened. I'm glad Tom's swooped in! You will find a variety of options on the menu here from burgers, tacos, burritos, sandwiches, bacon & eggs, pancakes, steak, pork chops,  fish & chips, salads, smoothies, and Mediterranean & Greek options, and believe it or not much more! They have some pretty good all day specials if you like breakfast.  Seniors 55+ get a free cup of coffee with any breakfast or lunch purchase.Hubby and I decided to split the "Pastrami Sandwich Combo" priced at $9.59 plus 40 cents for cheese. The combo came with fries and a drink. I also wanted to try the "Zucchini" priced at $3.99 and it came with a side of ranch. The pastrami sandwich was SO good. The bread held up the sandwich well and the mustard and pickles were just right. I know this is something that I will for sure be back for. Good pastrami in Vegas is hard to come by. The fries were excellent. I wasn't actually crazy about the zucchini. The ranch that it came with was a decent size though. They make the onion rings and zucchini from scratch. I want to try the onion rings next time, but will pass on the zucchini again. They have a drive-thru if you don't want to eat inside. The burgers are made fresh to order and the steak and chicken is hand trimmed on site. There are a lot of things I want to try here at Tom's so I will be back!
5	Menudo on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday!  I've seen the signs, and I finally did it and tried the menudo. It was different than what I grew up eating where cow stomach always had a little more chew on it. I am open to different types of food and quite enjoyed the way MegaTom's cooked theirs. It had more of a collagen or cooked tendon texture to it, but the soup was quite tasty. I can't handle super spicy, so I was very happy when I tried the soup, it was tasty, and the extra spice was in a small container to add in if I wanted to. The tortillas were excellent, nice and warm and soft. The serving portion is also huge.
2	Tom's was recommended by my brother, who said they had burgers like the So Cal neighborhood burger joints (we call them ghetto burgers).  Having fond memories of the burger joint in Valinda from my high school and college days, I was excited when I heard this news.  Living on the southwest side of Las Vegas, Tom's is a bit of a trek since it's in North Las Vegas but we were willing to give it a shot. Now I have two criteria that test the legitimacy of any "ghetto burger" place...whether or not they have Orange Bang, a neighborhood staple, and the quality of their chili cheese fries.Looking forward to a cup of Orange Bang the size of my head, I was highly disappointed to find out that Tom's didn't have Orange Bang...one strike against!  We proceeded to order Tom's classic cheeseburger, a pastrami burger, and an order of chili cheese fries. The cheeseburger and pastrami burger tasted like those found in Cali and were pretty good. However, I wasn't impressed at all with the chili cheese fries.  The chili was just average and was seasoned a bit too heavily with cumin. Plus, the French fries in the Cali spots are usually on the thicker side but Tom's uses thinner fries that get soggy much quicker....strike two against!! Lastly, Tom's is a bit on the pricey side for what you get. For the two burgers, chili cheese fries, and a large drink, we paid almost $18.  This is around what you would pay in Cali but the portions are much larger, so there is less value for the money with Tom's......strike three against!! If you live close by and like So Cali style charbroiled ghetto burgers, then you may enjoy Tom's, but for me, it's just not worth the drive from the other side of town.
5	My friend happens to live near this place, but she never tried it. So we decided to go late one night. The food was amazing! I ordered a caesar salad with grilled chicken, not expecting much. It was loaded with feta cheese chunks of tomatoes, olives, cucumber, and plenty of Veggies. I forgot to mention the delicious juicy grilled chicken . I thought $8.99 was a bit pricy for the salad but for the amount of food they put in, it was worth it. The service was amazing as well. I had called to check what time they were open and the gentlemen who answered the phone was very friendly. The service in the restaurant was good too. The gentlemen at the counter was very friendly. We ordered to go and the other gentlemen behind the counter brought us our order out to our seats. We accidentally had left the restaurant thinking we had both of our orders, and then one of the associates came chasing after us letting us know that we still had another order. I definitely recommend this restaurant. Food and service were both great! I can't wait to try other item on the menu!
5	Amazing! Best burger in Vegas for the price.. Mega Tom burger, fries and drink for $6! Excellent
4	More like 3.5 stars. The location is in deep North Las Vegas (non-yuppie chow town) so put into consideration what time would be best not to get shot and what not...so, I'd say before 2pm. Went here last night and it's a good thing football was on TV so everyone's at home.Their menu is pretty busy. They have burgers, fries, sammies, Greek salad, Mexican food, etc. They have combos in secret code and you probably have to be a regular to know what those codes are. I had a few bites of their pastrami burger and chili cheese fries, and an horchata. I might say the burger was pretty tasty and the party wasn't dry. The lettuce they put on the burger was green and fresh (way better than wilted fast food chain lettuce). Their pastrami is what I call "beginners pastrami" which is great for non-pastrami lovers like me. It tastes milder than the average pastrami.This is a no none sense type of place. You pick what you want, go up to the counter to place your order - if you ask questions they roll their eyes at you, take a number and have a seat, they bring your food to your table, you eat and you leave. What happens in between leaving the restaurant and walking to your car may vary.
3	Food was GOOD, but not great...just "ok" in my book.I went with the Pastrami Burger Combo ($7.99). Burger was ok, a bit overcooked and fairly thin. The Pastrami was a little mellow...not too much flavor here, but the SAUCE is great! It's good overall, but again, not great in my book. The standard fries are a bit boring.  You've all had something like these before...nothing good or bad about them, just very lightly seasoned and forgettable.Chili Cheese Fries ($4.99). Pet peeve of mine is when the cheese isn't even MELTED on top...and is still cold from the fridge. Chili was a bit SWEET too. Just ok. Fries were run of the mill...just average.I paid extra for the Horchata, and it was good.  It's an additional charge on top of the burger combo, and I don't think they offered free refills.Maybe the other stuff on the menu is better, but since it said "burgers" in the name, I was hoping that's what they specialized in :(Doubt I will be back
5	It is rare when I find myself on the north side of town. On occasion I do happen to drive through. I try to avoid it after dark at all costs since it is not the best area. I was a bit surprised when I saw this little gem, there are a lot of empty spaces in the shopping center but they were busy enough that I decided to give them a try.When I pulled up to the drive through , I was amazed at the huge menu. Reminded me of home sweet home (California). I wanted to sample everything off the menu but I had to practice self control. I ended up with the chili cheese burger combo and boy it did not disappoint. I gobbled that combo up within 5 minutes and was left wanting more, so what do you do when that happens? You go back for more!I went back the following morning to sample their breakfast. Steak and eggs, pancakes, and the pastrami burger. Oh and the sauce, don't let me forget about their burger sauce, it is amazing, definitely gives the burgers a great taste!It all was very good, the hash was very crispy but it was too plain, that is my only complain. Other than that, everything else was very good. Definitely worth the drive across town in my opinion.
4	No lies, I'm a fan. I discovered Mega Toms when I was on one of my patented food binges. The location is pretty nowhere, it's up in north town behind the drive in and not exactly something you'd expect to come across. Inside though, the location is beautiful. The menu is pretty extensive with burgers, burritos sandwiches and actual entrees. The variety is certainly nice. I've been here multiple times and I've changed every time.**The Good***Pastrami burger They have horchata and Jamaica Workers generally seem to like working there ***the bad*****They charge extra for Jamaica or horchata, which is the first I've ever seen of that anywhereThe only two times I've had the drive thru, the wait times were absolutely ridiculous The fries zucchini was extremely mehOverall, I like the place and wish the had more locations
3	It's impossible to find a good non-chain burger here in Vegas. Tom's is pretty good, not great. In So Cal there's a joint lke this on every corner. Here Tom has a corner on the market. It must be why he is over priced. I also dislike the location. I didnt enjoy the view of the ghetto from my window seat.
5	Wow I swallowed my food! I had steak and eggs. My partner had chicken strips and fries (to be safe lol) and my roommate had the grllied chicken salad. This food was amazing! All was made so good and from scratch.    We will be back as we live so close..so happy something  good around us...cause the walmart is awful lol.
5	Love it!! Charbroiled burgers omg so good!!! I felt like I was in a momma papa place like the ones they have in Cali.. Can't wait to go back!!!
5	Excellent tasting food. Worth the drive from S. Vegas. Had steak sandwich and as a do burrito.  Hmmm. Prices in their menu are no the same as in their Web site but it made up for taste
4	Love the Classic Taste of TOMS burgers reminds me of the good old days of fast food cheese burgers.
4	I love toms famous burgers out in california its a to go place when I go out there. So when I heard there was one in vegas called mega toms burgers I had to try it the service is great they are very friendly the food taste just as good as the one in california the chili cheese fries were very delicous and the double cheeseburger was even better the chicken strips were okay some were harder then others but still okay I hate that when I got them I got them as a meal so I had more food then I already intended to eat.  The vanilla milk shake was good and tasted just like you would expect a shake to taste overall the food was good and I was really full which was my intention and I plan on coming back whenever I get a chance.
5	The pastrami sandwich here is legit for Vegas. The size it good and the pastrami has a ton of flavor. The meat is thicker cut but extremely tender. The only strange thing about this sandwich is they use American cheese instead of swiss or provolone. The sandwich tastes good enough that I can overlook it but I would prefer a white cheese on it. It does come with mustard and pickles and the bread is freaking good. For about $10 make it a combo with fries an a drink. You can eat inside or they have a drive thru. They also have burgers and breakfast but just stick with the pastrami.
4	I give it a 3 1/2 stars.  Greasy goodness!  Mega Tom's is not a place I was familiar with until I saw reviews on Yelp.  Apparently they have quite a few of them in Cali, and they have a pretty big following.  I guess it only makes sense since we in LV are neighbors that eventually a Mega Tom's Burgers would show up on our side of the state line.Fair warning, be alert if you go visit Mega Tom's after the sun goes down!  Not that I can't get along in the near ghetto area (or have any issues with it), I just don't want you to think the surroundings are all roses & potpourri.  It's a lower income area so please, be respectful of the people around you.  You never know!  A knife in the kidney or a punch to the face can't be that fun.  And no, I would never make fun of the ghetto, as a college student I lived in a little apartment for 4 years near the badlands of UNLV (Flamingo & Spencer, anyone?) and I've been within throwing distance of gunshots, stabbings, and robberies.  With that, Mega Tom's is nice inside.  Clean and tidy for the most part.  Their menu is large are pretty scattered, so it's good if you're as indecisive as I am sometimes when it comes to eating.  There's a little bit for everyone.  Like, total randomness for everyone.  For our first visit to Mega Tom's we stuck with what they are popular for, burgers and sandwiches.  The wifey got the Mushroom Burger which she liked at first, until she bit into a large glob of warm mayo.  Ha Ha!  Don't ask me why, but she hates heated mayo on just about anything!  Ruined her appetite.  She liked the burger and the mushrooms with cheese, but the warm mayo set it over the top for her.  Way too greasy!  She ended up leaving the other half for me.  The little one had the Bacon Burger which she loved.  Burger.  Cheese.  Bacon.  Then another slice of Bacon.  And some lettuce and tomato for good measure.  She finished just about all of it.  Again, only complaint was that it was a little greasy.  I had the Club Sandwich (I love them so) and I was surprised.  It was of good quality.  The bread was toasty, the bacon was crispy, the lettuce and tomato were fresh, and there was a good amount of mayo on it for lubrication.  The ham and turkey were supermarket cold cut quality, but I can't ding them too much for that since it's not exactly fancy eats.  Overall a decent sandwich.My only complaint?  Greasy!  The onion rings and fries that came with my sandwich were on the slippery side.  Yep, extra napkins needed for cleanup.  We even opted for an extra order of onion rings and oh boy were those greasy too.  Either the oil needs changing or the folks at Mega Tom's need a better way to drain the excess grease!  As you well know, greasy food can leave and unsettling feeling in your tummy.  We all had that afterwards.  I really think we were just on grease overload is all.  If we took out the fries and onion rings, we would have probably been OK and enjoyed our meal more.Best part about Mega Tom's Burgers?  The prices!  All the combos we had were in the $6 - $8 range each.  Cheap eats for the masses!  And it looks like we will probably try here again soon, their breakfast and dinner plates look interesting, and lots of folks say their Mexican food is on par too.  We'll just get less fries and onion rings next time.Visit Mega Tom's Burgers...home of (Greasy) Gourmet Fast Food Dining!
4	Went here for lunch with a co-worker and food was good. Very clean and food was fresh and hot.
2	The fries were good and crispy..the burger was a bit of a let down. I felt like my bacon was thicker than the party itself..I was a bit disappointed.
5	Ordered the Western combo with chili cheese fries.... It's a little more expensive than LA but it taste just like Tom's/Tams/Tom's Jr in LA!!! I'll definitely comeback when I'm feeling homesick lol
1	This is nothing like the hamburger spots in LA. I got a breakfast burrito & it was awful. Just greasy & didn't even taste like it had any salt or other seasonings. I thought ok u have salsa & peppers that will make it better, wrong! How do you even make salsa with no taste! I will not be going back & wasting my money.
1	Can't blame the cashier for not getting our order correct or for not getting my food delivered to my table. Management there had the cashier taking orders and attempting to deliver food to the tables. Won't be going back. Drove to the other side of town to end up not even eating after 30 minutes ended up getting a refund. Disgusting thing was when I went to get a refund my food was waiting to be delivered (uncovered).
2	It sounded so good. I guess I should have had my first warning from the super large menu at the drive through.  Fast food places can't possibly do so many different items very well.  The burger was better than a McD's burger in terms of appearing to be real meat but it was overcooked but had a touch of salty flavor.  The ingredients appeared fresh but were slopped all over the burger so they were falling out the side covered in wayyyyy too much sauce.  There was simply no way to eat this without a mess.  It didn't help that the bun was a flat soggy goo. Maybe I should have tried some of the other items that people are raving about.The indigestion I suffered afterwards reminds me why I stopped eating fast food to begin with.The service was also pretty bad. My food was ready and in a bag on the counter and sat there for 5 minutes while the drive through guy took care of the only walk in customer in the restaurant. Finally the prep cook had to give it to me.
4	Food was good. I got a cheeseburger it tasted fresh. They messed up our order by not putting cheese on one of the burgers and then wanted us to pay extra for their mistake. I was surprised they didn't just fix the mistake seeing as how it was their fault. Good portion sizes and friendly staff. Just wish they would have fixed their mistake.
4	This place is slightly slow... but worth the wait. Love the avocado burger.
4	I just tried this place yesterday and I thought the burger I had was great. I will definitely be hitting this place up again
4	Was in Vegas checking out the downtown area on a Saturday night. Before going back to the strip, my friends and I were in the mood for a good ol fashion burger joint. Mega Toms is just that type of place. My Philli cheese steak was good, my friend's pastrami sandwich was on point, and my other friend had no complaints about his bacon burger. The fried mushrooms were good, but the fried zucchini was very addicting! They have bottomless soda with your combo meals and the food portions are going to fill you. The staff was really cool, nice atmosphere with the tv, and plenty of everything available on the menu. The only thing I noticed is this place is more expensive than the local burger joints where I live. $10-13 combo meals compared to the $8-9 combos for the same food I eat my local joint. But I'd still eat here again next time I'm in Vegas and want that burger joint food taste.
4	good quik service burgers are pretty good and not too pricey was pretty busy inside and out and they got all our food in no time and was warm not cold food...  super clean inside and clean restrooms
4	Great burgers. Haven't tried anything else. Definitely not fast food. Takes a while to get your order but so far the wait has been worth it.
4	I got the ultimate combo (this thing is a monster! 3 patties!) the girl at the counter was very nice, and the dining room is empty at 11:40 am, but the drive thru had some cars in it. I think I made the right choice of coming inside since there are only 2 people working, and they're having trouble running the window.The burger was great! Fries were ok, and the soda was a little flat, but I'll come back and order again. Do yourself a favor and avoid the drive thru...
4	Pretty tasty turkey burger .  Combo w drink and fries in 5 bucks ...just want the burger .. 5 bucks
4	Breakfast burritos are awesome.  Fried Zucchini is the best in town.  Onion rings are good.  Breakfast plates are a great deal - quick, fresh, and better than IHOP.  Values items are good - bean and cheese values burrito beats any taco chain.  They are always busy and the food is good.  It's not a fancy place and it's in the hood, but it's one of my favorites.  Some menu items like pastami sandwiches are kind of expensive, but the portions are large.
1	I got excited when I found a burger joint in las Vegas been out here three months. From la n this food was very expensive for the quality of the food n proportions were small. The fries weren't cooked all the way through n onions rings was like they got skinny paper onions n battered them up. No good n I love burgers. I did like the WiFi n tv's n how they brought the food out. But I wouldn't go here if ur in need or a good burger
3	Pretty good burgers and chili cheese fries. Breakfast is ok for a drive-thru as well. They need to clean their iced tea machine though, tastes dirty and burnt.
