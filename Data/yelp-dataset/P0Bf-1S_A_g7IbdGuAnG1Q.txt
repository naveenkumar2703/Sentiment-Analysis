5	This is a Sinclair Gas Station and Convenience Store that has a full service deli inside. They have great food, and have excellent service. I regularly order take out in advance for large meetings. Thank you Lisa for great service.
5	They make food here! Yes it's a deli inside they also sale beer. They provide you with great staff who will educate you on meats and cheese if you have never had them. It's a nice little spot to stop in and get gas and also coffee or cups of Ice and we all know I love Ice. I give it five stars total.
4	I've been to this location several times.  At least 3 out of 4 visits I walk out with a smile due to the customer service and friendly employees. Great job!
