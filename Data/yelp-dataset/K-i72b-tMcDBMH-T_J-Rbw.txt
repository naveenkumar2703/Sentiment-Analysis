5	The guys at this location are awesome!  They are very friendly and helpful.  The prices are great!  Our serpentine belt had cracks and it was $129 to replace.  I checked around on prices, and this was the cheapest.  They even allowed us to drop the car off and come back for it.  They give us a $5 discount every time we go in.  I would recommend this location.  If they think you can get it done cheaper somewhere else, they will tell you and let you know where to go.
5	Open on Sunday, super fast, didn't try to scare me into purchasing services and things I didn't need.  Just plain nice guys.  Specifically Tyler.  He was great.  Congratulations Jiffy Lube, you have won me over and I'm looking forward to more visits. Thank you.
5	Well the best way to know what a place is like is when something goes wrong. I took my car in, and something happend with the radiator cap. It lost all of the coolant and this burnt my water pump and other parts. I called them and they immediately called my car repair place. By the end of the day, the care was fixed and they took care of the bill.Thanks, JIffy Lube!
1	This place is overpriced and slow. They try their best to overcharge customers. This will be the last Jiffy Lube I go to.
5	Fast and polite, no pressure to buy anything extra. I will use this place again.
5	Honest, fast, no upsell & open Sunday
