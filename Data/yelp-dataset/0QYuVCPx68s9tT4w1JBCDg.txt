3	A traditional pub & hotel located next to the Murrayfield Hotel. Very friendly staff, quaint bar and impressive looking menu. I haven't as yet eaten here so cannot comment, but plan to soon enough!
4	The Hampton is the nearest thing to a pub in this area of town. Nice bar area and very friendly staff. Had food once here, but as a veggie there wasn't a huge amount to choose from on the menu.   Has a good reputation for food with local folk though.
