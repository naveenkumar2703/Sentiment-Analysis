1	I dont even know why anyone likes this place. All their meats taste exactly the same, like nasty rubber salami.And there was a fly in my soup.Even their commercials fucking suck. Did they really think Spongemonkeys singing the most annoying song in the world would make people want to buy sandwiches...?I'm all set with Quiznos. Thanks, but no thanks.
5	A leg of the Quiznos franchises decided to go their own way and become "Dad's Deli". This store is not one of them, it's still a Quiznos. I admit I'm a Quiznos fanboy, but this one is one of the better stores and it's hidden back in the corner of this shopping center.The food here is good and the staff is friendly and fast.
1	So about a week ago I go into this Quiznos please do not get me wrong I love Quiznos to dealth and still do!  This one used to be one of the good ones but last wed I went in for my choose two veggie flatbread and salad no chicken after my hubby wanting a flat bread and them telling him no I still wanted mine so I order to find out they no longer do a veggie flat bread I know things change and cost money but I tried to explain all I wanted was lettus tom and sauce on my flat bread no cheese no quac ect they wanted me to pay 5 bucks for that when I could get a chicken one with cheese for 3?  Makes no sense sorry guys you were the best I was driving 45 mins just to get your Quiznos but after refusing to make our sand witches and wanting to charge me 5 dollars for a flatbread with vinegarette and lettus and tomatoes. No thanks!!! Wish you would make your customers number 1 we used to go to your store 2 times a week
1	First we find a wad of hair in a sandwich. Then i almost choke on a metal shard in my meatball  sub. Now the messed up our sandwich and when we asked them to fix it the lady there starts complaining to another customer about me for wanting my sandwich correct.This place is just awful.
