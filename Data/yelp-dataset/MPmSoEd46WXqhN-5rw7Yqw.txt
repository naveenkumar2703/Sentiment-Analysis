4	I am amazed that people are queuing to get to the Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill when  food as good as this is available for a tiny bit more money in far nicer surroundings than  aforementioned chains.  This is a small Seattle based chain that is "hiding" out on Greenway   and does not deserve to be as quiet on a week night as we found it this Wednesday.   The wedding soup was excellent   I'm pretty sure that's home made stock from the bones  ( either that or they have a kick ass supply house)  but it was really nice, flavor from all the ingredients came through.   Main course Cannelloni  which was very enjoyable, piping hot, and nicely stuffed .   Let down?  Frozen tiramisu   which is a shame as I think they could pull off a great one  if they did as well as the prior two course. Nice  staff too.  Come on  please keep them busy we want to keep going back here:D Physically it's a really nice looking restaurant , outdoor patio's nice but  sadly they can't really help the Kmart  to the side or the Goodwill on the other side  best stay indoors :)
4	Amante's Saturday night @ 6pm. We have had the pizza delivered and it was awesome, so we figured we should try the pasta. The family had:1. Putanessca: Black olives, artichoke hearts, cheese tortellini, mushrooms, capers, Parmesan cheese, and pesto topped with feta cheese and marinara sauce. Served with salad and garlic bread. **it is now a favorite**2. Baked Fettuccine Fromaggio: Alfredo sauce, Meatballs, Gorgonzola, Mozzarella, Parmesan Cheese. Served with salad and garlic bread.**excellent**3. Kids had Fettuccine Alfredo: Fettuccine noodles smothered in Alfredo sauce and Spaghetti served in homemade or meat sauce. **Both were great.**4. Cookie Craze Layers of chocolate cookie crumbles, cookies and cream ice cream, and chocolate syrup. Don't get excited about this either, it was Blue Bunny...no really, we got it to go and they just threw the entire package in the to go box. ha haSo to sum it up. They were excellent with the customer service, even though the waiter was brand spankin new, the food was better the Olive Garden but not as quality as Maggianos. The prices were reasonable and the interior of the building is great. The exterior is great too if you have blinders, don't look left or right.... :-) To be honest, we will be back and bring some guests this time.
5	Is this place really suppose to be next to KMart and GoodWill?! I mean, this place has AMAZING food and when you walk in, its interior just seems odd for where its located. Its nice, but seems too fancy for this kind of casual dining experience. But can't complain. Now lets talk food... I LOVE pizza, so I've tried to visit any and all pizza places I possibly can. And hands down, this place has one of my ALL time favorite pizzas. They have the absolute freshest ingredients.  I just can't believe more people don't know about this place. Everyone I've taken there loves it. Please do note, the cost is a little higher than expected but so worth it when you taste how good it is!  I've been there 5 times already! You Must go and try this place out! Or at least order for delivery! They have a whole menu of great food!
4	Amante has some delicious salads, pastas and good pizza. The best part for me? It's right down the street from my house. The decor is freakin awesome. Lots of columns & neat decorations, you'll feel like you're dining in an upscale restaurant, but the prices aren't that bad ($9 - $15 for most pasta dishes). We really enjoyed the food, but they no longer have a liquor license. According to our server, they no longer serve alcoholic drinks since approximately 1 month ago. Again, I like the food, but I want some freakin wine with my Italian dinner. This short-coming will keep us from becoming repeat visitors.
3	I read the following and decided to go with putanessca weird but no marinara in mine I was bummed I have the flu and was really craving tomato sauce. Cheese pesto and feta something I could make if I felt better. The wedding soup was awesome. Bread was very good but take it from me order extra :) Maybe I'll throw this in the fridge and try it later on. Not the same Putanessca: Black olives, artichoke hearts, cheese tortellini, mushrooms, capers, Parmesan cheese, and pesto topped with feta cheese and marinara sauce. Served with salad and garlic bread. **it is now a favorite**
3	My Hubby & I have ordered in dinner here at least 10-20 times since we moved into our house about 2 years ago. They are always our go to spot when we don't feel like cooking or going out, it doesn't hurt that they have free delivery either. Maybe one day we will make it in for a sit down meal, but until then I can't really comment about the interior. We have ordered a variety of things from their menu including: tortellini special, four cheese baked spaghetti, white spaghetti, chicken parmesan, mix seafood penne, meatball parmesan sub, house & caeser salads, quesadillas, potato skins & the cookie craze dessert. Oh & I think we got a pizza once, I believe it had 4 different kinds of cheese on it. Overall we like it here & will continue to come here for the yummy Italian dishes!
4	This place has a generous menu and everything we've tried has been amazing.  Their delivery service is quick and our orders are always correct.  Definitely try their Baklava as well!!!
1	I have been here once and the food wasn't very good. We ordered the artichoke dip and and white spaghetti. The artichoke dip wasn't very good and I could have made better pasta at home. There was an Indian restaurant that opened up in the same plaza and closed down within a couple of months due to slow business. I live in the area and drive by this restaurant several times a day and it is NEVER busy and yet it is still open. Things that make you hmmm...........
5	Ordered delivery many times. Pizza and Calzones mostly. Always perfectly cooked and lots of toppings.Never been disappointed with anything I've ordered there.
1	Had to revise.  We ordered delivery while packing.  Finally, after two hours of waiting I called the store. They claimed it was just going out? What. The. Hell. It should not take two hours to put together some spaghetti and a ham sandwich!By the time it arrived, it was two and a half hours late. The delivery guy called said "Uh, lady there is no third floor apartments here". I said "yes there is" and hung up on him, I was so mad! Finally he knocked on the door, handed me the food on it's side, and dripped runny red sauce all over my new rug.  His response? "Lady, there is red crap dripping out". SERIOUSLY???The food would've been good, but it was icy cold and congealing together. Not one apology was given. I will NEVER order from these food f*cktards again.
4	Yelp cuts off my review so be sure to check my blog for a full review (with photos!):http://nomnomreviews.blogspot.com/[Excerpt from Food Portion of Review]Amante's serves a very wide variety of food.  I naturally gravitate toward the sandwich genre, and more specifically, the chicken sandwich genre.  I really am trying to expand, but...baby steps.  I ordered the chicken Parmesan hot sub/grinder.  It is served with marinara sauce, onions, Parmesan and mozzarella cheese on French bread.  The only change I made was to have the marinara sauce served on the side.  I do this because I find that most restaurants that prepare chicken Parmesan prepare the sandwich first, and they apply the sauce too soon prior to serving it.  When the sandwich is served the bread becomes soggy which really kills the experience for me.  As a result, I have become accustomed to ordering the sauce on the side.The sandwich was very, very good.  In fact, I would actually rate Amante's as having one of the best chicken Parmesan sandwiches to be ranked with some of the greats like DeFalcos, Meatballz or Yo Paulies.The chicken is prepared grilled and then diced and topped with a generous amount of Parmesan and surprisingly sweet red onions.  Occasionally the French bread housing is burned or over-cooked, but not to an unacceptable level.  The sandwich really does hold up to the price tag and I usually finish the entire thing, leaving me quite full.My father ordered the same as myself and it was prepared the same way.We also ordered a pizza for the table.  We didn't go bold or try anything special - straight cheese pizza.  It arrived piping hot and we found the pizza to be standard fare, nothing ultra impressive but still good enough to keep us wanting another few slices.  One thing we noticed was the size.  The photographed pizza is actually a medium, which serves a hefty 6 slices of pizza.My wife ordered the spaghetti and meat sauce.  The spaghetti was pretty standard, nothing fancy - big fat tasty noodles.  The meat sauce was what I would also consider average.  This was the first time we have ever ordered pasta at Amante's and my wife's initial reaction to the sauce was that it was too thick.  The taste was alright, but the consistency was very...pasty.  The presentation was great and the fresh parmesan and garlic bread compliment the overpowering sauce.[End Food Excerpt]
2	Ok, I admit: I'm really hard on restaurants, but my standard is simple: The food has to be better than what I can prepare at home.Sweet Lady Wife and I went to Amante tonight.  I ordered Mix Seafood Penne.  Here's the description on the menu: "King crab meat, shrimp, chopped garlic, lobster sauce, pepper, garnished with asparagus & parmesan cheese"The dish I was served bore little resemblance to that description: penne pasta, run-of-the-mill creme sauce, some asparagus spears and three - count 'em: three - shrimp.The decor was beautiful.  I wish the food lived up to it.
1	ARE YOU FREAKIN' KIDDING ME??I got home tired and hungry and decided to give them a try. I got the name of this place from Yelp (go figure) and despite the prices gave them a shot by ordering online. Mine was a simple order; a bowl of soup, a spinach salad, a turkey sandwich soda and carrot cake.Prepare for sticker shock-- total came to over $32 before tip.Then things began to go wrong. The driver arrives at my door with six $20 bills and my food, no change. He cops an attitude like his not having change is my problem, not his-- like I should tip him over $7 for having no change. I dig for the small bills and he gets the total plus tow and change. He turns and departs. I examine my order to find I'm short the soup and have no dressing for the salad.Bottom line: over 2 hours, five phone calls and a snub from the owner/manager later I still have no soup, dressing and have paid over $32 for a turkey sandwich, a dried out tine wedge of carrot cake aand some Sierra Mist. Best food value this side of the food court at the Moscow airport!If having read this you do business with this restaurant you deserve whatever you get... or don't get.
4	I think this may win the best pizza I've had in Phoenix since taking a job here in 2006! We did take out & got two vegetarian choices. One was a Venice with artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, goat cheese..& was a small piece of Italian heaven in my mouth. I loved the Chicago style crust... Yum! My friends raved about this place close to our neighborhood.. I'm now a fan...& I'll drive a bit further to get what I know is close to perfect:-)
1	The delivery guy & the girl who answers the phone are so freakin rude! When we placed a delivery order about 2 months ago they forgot my husband's salad. The delivery guy said he'd be back to drop it off. My husband called them with a bit of an attitude & the girl hung up on him. The delivery guy never came back to bring the salad we paid for. We ordered from them about once a month but never will again.
5	Deeelicious!  The first time my wife and I went here, we were amazed at how NOT busy it was.  Every restaurant in the Phoenix area seems to be constantly busy - every day - but not this one!  Each time we have been here, we have either been the only people in the place or one of only 2 occupied tables!  Weird!  We asked our server about this and were told they do a lot of take-out business.  We have noticed this to be true on our visits.  Ok - on to the food.  We have had pizza, pasta, entrees, and sandwiches.  All of it was good (with the exception of one weird chicken parm), but the best thing is definitely the pizza!  We love their pizza, especially the Amante Special!  It is very very good!  The crust is tender and sturdy without taking over the whole pie.  The sauce is tasty but not overbearing.  There are always plenty of toppings on each slice.  The sandwiches come in a close second, with our favorite being the canadian bacon one - yum!  My wife says they have the BEST caesar salad she has ever had - sometimes she has to get 2 to satisfy her craving!  I would agree that the salads are good - I generally get the side house salad with ranch dressing.  It is always fresh and crisp with lots of veggies.  All-in-all we will definitely continue to eat at this restaurant!
4	I read the yelp reviews and thought that this was a gamble, but it paid-off for me!The girl taking my order was super sweet, but not too helpful on the desert selections. I ordered the Amante Special and a slice of Cheesecake with a sides of chocolate and strawberry (no extra charge!). She said that the pizza would arrive in about 45 minutes but delivery was prompt at almost 30 minutes. The delivery guy had enough change for my $100 bill, but I had also asked BEFORE my order so that I would know if he could break it. Unfortunately there was no chocolate sauce, but I survived nonetheless. It was on the reciept, so I am assuming there was some sort of a mix-up/oversight as my order was headed out the door.The crust on this pizza was awesome, not too thin and not too greasy. The toppings were exactly as the menu had stated. There was the perfect amount of sauce. We are eating left overs today (just as good on day two), the pizza was HUGE!The slice of Cheesecake was nothing to write home about, quite meager in fact. The strawberry sauce was nice, but still nothing mind-shattering. We will definitely be ordering from here again, it is right around the corner from our house and we REALLY want to try some of their other dishes!
2	Ho Hum.  I have never eaten here.I have never done business with these people.I have never even driven by this location.Why oh why do they deserve a ONE star review?TEXT SPAMMING ME with PIZZA OFFERS on means that these people must not make very good pizza.  I am really really hoping that they did nt get my phone number from Yelp.  That would make me really rethink my Yelp account as well.Anyways, the funny thing about their text is it said, "do not reply" at the bottom.  Ah, so right...you get to spam me and I cannot even tell you to stop?  Guess what, those Pizzas I just ordered online...I hope they sit there for the next two hours waiting for a pick-up that is never gonna happen.  Jerks.My phone.  Not yours.
1	Was not impressed at all. The place was dead on a friday eve, understandably so. Will not return.
