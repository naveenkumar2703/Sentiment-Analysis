4	I had a suit that needed to be altered, and I asked two friends who had recently had tailoring done for a recommendation.   They independently both recommended this place.  I haven't been to this new location, but I was very pleased with the work they did at the old location.  The work was very high quality and reasonably priced- it was more than I wanted to pay initially, but after I saw the results, I felt like it was a fair price and money well spent.  I would highly recommend them.
1	I was so disappointed when going here.  I showed up with a few simple hems and the owner was so rude and brash.  She insisted I go try on my clothes before giving me an estimate.  I stepped in the room and overheard her talking to another customer saying it will be an additional $15 extra PER garment to get it in less then 4 days.  I immediately stepped out and said I need an estimate before I start trying on my clothes.  Especially since I needed them in 3 days before going on vacation.  She way overpriced me and then just stepped away in the middle of it to talk to her husband about another order in a foreign language.  There were no other customers waiting and she could have shown me the courtesy to finish with me and answer my questions.  Not even a "excuse me for a minute".  I think in this economic climate small businesses must stand out and go the extra mile.  I have a small business and I would never ever treat one of my customers that way!  Needless to say I walked out and took my business elsewhere.  Don't waste your time at this place.
5	I needed a last minute pair of pants to be hemmed for an interview. They were able to do it in just a few hours and it was only $15! The pants looked great and the interview went well!
