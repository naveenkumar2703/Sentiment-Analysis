1	Let's see, why not stop at the Burger King in the middle of nowhere?* Service* Flies* DirtinessWow. I wish we had stopped at McDonalds or just about anywhere else instead. When we walked in the dining room was staffed by what appeared to be the entire family of one of the employees. Kids, husband, grandparents, cousins. And they were all hanging out by the soda machine, blocking the only access to the front counter. But even if the family were there every time, the three reasons listed above would definitely keep me from visiting again.Seriously, there are like two other restaurants within a few blocks. They really couldn't be any worse.
1	In our opinion, you should avoid this fast food stop at all costs! Horrible service!  Our hamburger with mustard and pickles only had to be remade twice. How hard is it to take an order and make it as requested, not once, but twice!That's not all, we requested Apple Fries and got an Apple Pie, I can understand the mistake, but when the manager and assistant manager don't care enough about customer service, both saw our issue with the burger remakes, and didn't make an effort to take care of us.  If this wasn't enough, we were over charged for the Apple Pie and come to find out we were charged for a cheese-burger.  I know, I know, not a ton of cash, but it was my cash and with the absolute disregard for customer service, the Burger King in Gila Bend Arizona ranks among the top 10 worst experiences in our many fast food stops.Stay away, enjoy the Mickey D's down the road, anything but stop here! It deserves less than a star on multiple levels.
3	Compared to other BKs, it's somewhere in the middle.  The tables all looked like they needed to be cleaned.  Thankfully I had my trusty sanitizer wipes with me.  Other than that, the food tastes like any other BK.
