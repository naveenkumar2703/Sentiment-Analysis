5	Great store, great service, and great selection.This stores is beautiful, even more beautiful are it's dressing rooms.  I recommend trying something on, just for that purpose.  Overall, the selection is nice, I think they also have a great men's selection.  The most recent time I went (after xmas) they were having a sale, which is always nice.  The sales people were very helpful, but not pushy.  I am surprised that the prior reviewer said they were not acknowledged.  I was within second upon entering.I love Dolce and Gabanna so of course I will go back...Love me my Italian Fashion
5	I do love D&G I just havent been lucky getting styles I love the past yr.  This store is great.
