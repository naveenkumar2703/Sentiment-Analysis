5	Absolutely favorite place! This outstanding therapist will fix your points of tension with competency of a NASA engineer!  Once I got a massage after a 30 mile hike & felt like I went for a light stroll in the park. I am always impressed with how rejuvinated I feel and that my aches and tensions that stressed me for years are not simply aleviated, but rather get fixed! The facilities are clean and relaxing. The therapist is professional and very nice, she will make you feel very comfortable. The price is very reasonable, especially if you think of the high quality and beneficial effect. I highgly recommend this place- the most professional, competent and effective therapist!
5	Little Bohemian has been my massage therapist for about 4 years now and I can highly recommend her. She is doing an outstanding job and knows what your body needs. I have consulted her when being stressed out, worn out, as well as after accidents and every time I leave her massage studio I am feeling MUCH better.Besides getting an amazing massage Little Bohemian is able to give you a lot of helpful tips on how to be nicer to your body due to her being a yoga instructor as well.The facility itself she is working out of is very clean and professional while giving you a cozy and welcoming feeling.I can recommend Little Bohemian and have done so for years.
5	Had the best massage from Jeanette! I was having some muscle soreness and other issues related to running.  I was barely able to lift my leg off the ground or walk without pain.  After just one session with Jeanette, I was walking with very little/no pain.  She's very knowledgable and compassionate too.  I highly recommend!
