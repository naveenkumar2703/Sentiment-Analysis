1	Worst service. Rude. VERY RUDE. Long wait time. DON'T be in the wrong line, a smart ass employee will wait till you're next to tell you to get in the correct line. Drive out of your way to avoid this store.
3	Needed Battery Check Was told to wait till all other Customers checked out ..waited 30 mins for battery check .....check battery and said needs to charge,  so told them i had a charger at home and will do so, but they couldnt give a jump after i said that i will need a jump if you have me turn  off the engine ... went home decided just to buy new battery , brought to the store ,check battery and now said Cell is Bad !! No one has a clue on what there doing....over all still need them to get parts from them & thats why i rated them 3 stars..:)
1	Unfortunately I didn't have the Yelp application to find out how HORRIBLE, DISGUSTING, and GHETTO this AutoZone is (and I capitalize knowing that emotions can never go through text). There was no greeting as I enter the door - needless to say that is not important - all I needed was a tire gauge. After finding the gauge, I made my way to what was already a very-long line. I was in the line for approximately ten minutes before one the tellers announced that there should be two lines. One for checking out and the other for parts. There was one other person in front of me - its been about 30 minutes now. I decided to wait in the line I was in because there was another long line for the check out isle and I already waited in line - thinking I would be helped when I get in the front - I wasn't. Finally getting to the counter the sales associate says that I have to go back into check out line. "I have been here 30 minutes," I tell him. And he goes, "tough." Needless to say, I will NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN!!!!!! F&*c% this place and its people!
3	Not always the best customer service but they do help.
