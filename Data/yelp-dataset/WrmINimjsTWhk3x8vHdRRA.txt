4	I have been going to Rose for over a year and always get great service.  Quality hair cut and color that lasts!  It is quite a drive for me but I can't imagine changing as long as I live in the Valley.
5	I have been going to Diamante's Salon for five years. The entire staff is professional, sincere, and my hair has never looked better! The salon is clean, prices are competitive, and the staff is friendly.
4	Excellent salon.  Rose is wonderful! Quality services and competative prices.
1	I guess I should have asked for Rose.  I tried this salon because my hairdresser moved and groupon had it on their website.  Worst haircut of my life, I asked for two things...make sure I can still pull it back in a pony and make it all one length...didn't get either one right, one side is about a half inch shorter and won't stay back and she beveled the back instead of texturizing...
5	Amazing! Candie is fantastic! She took her time with me, listened to what I wanted and gave me one of the best salon experiences yet! I am so happy with my hair and absolutely loved the salons atmosphere and staff! I will definitely be going back!
