5	After being on the phone with Verizon Wireless trying to figure out why my phone wasn't working for 4.5 hours, I was put in touch with Sharpie Tech. Well, after 10 seconds they fixed the problem. As the owner of a company that does our best numbers over the holiday season, having my phone out of order for 4.5 hours was horrible. Sharpie Tech fixed the problem in record time, even Verizon was shocked. I highly recommend working with this company and I look forward to working with them more. -Rachel CharlupskiFounder and CEO, The Babysitting Company
5	Great service! Corey is very service oriented. Works fast and very effiecient with his time. Going to use him again real soon to do additional IT services. thanks Corey.
5	If you enjoy service by someone who is as competent as he is personable, I would recommend Corey Kaplan highly. The time he has spent here has been very productive and working with him educational and enjoyable. I hope not to need him again (though this is highly unlikely) but knowing he is there if I do is very nice. By the way, I'm not from El Centro, CA. but Scottsdale, AZ.
