5	I can always count on Daniel to make my hair look great!   I have been all over the valley getting cuts and color, and no one does a consistently better job.  I would follow him anywhere.
5	Daniel is really awesome!  I have gotten so many compliments, from many different people, on how great my hair looks!!! He truly listens to what I want as a customer and then goes about cutting, coloring, and creating as he cultivates my appearance.I also appreciate the fact that he works with me on my eclectic schedule.  Moreover, I like how he posts "special rates" on his FaceBook page : )I would highly recommend his services to anyone, whether you are a male or a female. Daniel at Alchemy is a 5-Star Stylist!
5	When I moved to Phoenix from NYC 6 years ago, I tried about 10 salons and couldn't find one with which I was happy, including some big, expensive salons. I found Daniel in 2007 when he was working at another salon, and I've been following him every since. I have never had a bad haircut, my color is always perfect, and he makes himself available to me whenever I need him. Plus, his prices are very competitive. I tried two other salons through the discount emails and each time Daniel had to fix my hair. I will never go to anyone else again! I recommended him to friends who tried him and they were very happy as well. I agree... he's a 5-star stylist!
