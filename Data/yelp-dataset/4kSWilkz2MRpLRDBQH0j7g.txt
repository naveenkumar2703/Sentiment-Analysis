3	I am surprised I have never reviewed this place.  It is not a frequent stop, maybe twice a year.  I think I prefer the spices in KFC but Church's comes without all the grease.  This stop last Saturday about 12:30 I was second in line that turned in to about a dozen people and they had maybe six pieces of chicken in the serving trays so we all got to hang out for a while waiting for the chicken.
3	Churches chicken is better then KFC. what else is there to say. Also go to the website they have coupons there. The spicy chicken is good.
5	I've been to many Church's Chickens and I like this one the best because I always get fresh chicken. Besides that, the manger is super friendly and I always get extra strips :) or an upgrade for free!
1	OK didn't want to cook it was 10pm so thought pick up this to take home yule never go here. Kfc is way better.  This place chicken sucks. All there food sucks.
2	Crawling with bugs! It was definitely not my first time here, but the first time to see the bugs! There was 3-8  roaches at a time coming out of the wood. We told the staff and they said, "The manager is here, there is nothing we can do."
