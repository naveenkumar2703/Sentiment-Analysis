5	High quality food at more than reasonable prices. Makes me look forward to eating lunch again! Roasted veggie salad is ridiculously good and filling.
5	Came into town for some business and they ordered Brown Bag for the meeting.  It may be called Brown Bag, but it was the food was more like something I would find at a nice sit down on the strip. In fact, it was better than the place we ended up going to that night. Definitely took me by surprise.  Considering that most of the items we got were on the healthier side, it was amazing that the flavors were as good as they were. My favorite was the cold sesame noodle salad, but it was all tasty.  The miserable hot weather make me not look forward to going into Vegas for business, but if they feed me like this every time, than maybe it won't be so bad.
5	I love Brown Bag! As a busy professional with type 1 diabetes, I really need to look after myself and my diet.  It's easy to skip lunch but Brown Bag saves my life daily. I look forward to trying the weekly specials - everything is always so delicious.  Very reasonable pricing, healthy options...it really is a no brainer.  You won't be disappointed!
