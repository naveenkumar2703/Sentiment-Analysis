5	My insurance company uses Quik Pik Towing / All Over Towing as their main service provider which makes me a little more secure when I have needed their services.  I have had my car towed 4 times ( transmission issue) and have had 2 road services in the past year and a half.  EVERY service was kick-ass!  Their drivers are respectful, clean, and on time.  I even had a female driver one time, which was awesome! You go Girl!  Great service all the time!
5	My vehicle broke down and was left at a shopping center late night. It was enough stress trying to figure how to get vehicle fixed..but along with that comes the worry of getting the vehicle towed to my auto shop by a trustworthy..and affordable towing company in the area. After researching companies on google and Yelp..I came across Quik Pik also known as All Over Towing.  They were the only placed I called and was very impressed with Meghan at their office, and Eric the driver. I was quoted 45 mintues and he was their in 20 minutes. Even called me when approaching the area where my car was located. It was quickly transported to Advanced Tire and Auto on 8th st and Greenway Pkwy whom the towing company and I do business. It was a relief to have such professional people to deal with in this business considering there are a lot of shady ones out there. Thanks again !
5	I would recommend this company to anyone!  They came on time at the promised time. The person that towed my car was quick and professional. Also have new trucks that do the job perfectly.
