3	I adore Topshop, it has to be my favourite shop in the whole world and I think it get a bad press for being overpriced, I don't think it's that expensive at all to be honest. It's no more expensive than River Island or Miss Selfridge and nobody seems to complain about the prices there. Plus, Topshop clothing is fabulous quality and I've had items from Topshop that I've had for about 6 years and they're still in pretty good nick.I have to say, I think this is the only Topshop I've gone into a left without buying anything. It's a very small branch and for some reason feels really dark and uninviting. Due to it's small size all the clothes are packed in so tightly together that it's hard to see what's what and although it always has the latest Topshop trends it doesn't have them all so a visit to the Princes Street branch is a much better bet. I guess for it's size, it does it's best but it's just not as exciting as the Princes Street branch.
