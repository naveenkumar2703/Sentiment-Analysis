5	I love this store! There is always something different and unique I find at an affordable price. The owner is a guy named Warren and he is very friendly and personable. This store has a wide variety of different goods from antiques to clothes to gently used furniture to one of a kind decorative items. There is even a hardware section with new and vintage hardware items. I love to go in his store and look around to get decorating ideas and I usually wind up buying something while there. Warren is a little flexible on his prices and you can do a little haggling with him but be prepared for him to haggle back! This business is the quintessential example of the small neighborhood business in the days of America long ago. The fact that he is thriving tells you it CAN be done and this guy does it right. I think his devotion to customer service and his personable style are top notch and the key to the success of this business. Right on 2 B Thrifty!
