5	Best paint  in the world fast quick n easy . Customer service excellent
2	Only come here for the Jeff Lewis paint line. The staff is unbearably slow each time we come here. There are three employees for a fairly steady flow of customers. If Jeff Lewis Color was sold elsewhere, I'd never shop here.
5	Dunn Edwards paint is professional quality and pro selection. Their color matching is top notch with great service . As far as the Jeff Lewis comment in the previous review, it is made by Dunn Edwards they just double the price because of the designer name so do yourself a favor and get a premium dunn Edwards paint. It's half the price and same quality .great job guys! Luke Brush and Ladder Specialty Paint llc
