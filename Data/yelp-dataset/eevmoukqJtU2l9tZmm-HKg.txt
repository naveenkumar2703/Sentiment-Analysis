5	this is an annual running event, to get folks to 'resolve' to embrace a healthier lifestyle. only 5k, it starts and ends in papago park. a short jaunt through the park, onto the canal, then turn around and head back the way you came. quick, easy, and it starts at 9am so you don't have to get up at the butt crack of dawn, and over by 10:30am so you have the rest of the day to enjoy. they have TONS of free raffle prizes along with tasty goodies from sweet tomatoes restaurant. plenty of parking, free long-sleeve t-shirt (i guess not technically free since you pay for the race), and just a good crowd. every year, early january.
5	Another year, another Resolution Run 5k! This run is a nice way to start off the new year. It's quick, it's close, and the Running Masters who put it together always have such a fun attitude! For a $25 registration fee, you get a long-sleeve chromatic t-shirt which changes color in the sun. The race is sponsored by Sweet Tomatoes and this year was also sponsored by Cliff Bar-both of which provided snacks after the run. There are medals awarded to the top three finishers in each age category and a raffle for various prizes such as water bottles, sports bags, and gift certificates to Sole Sports and Sweet Tomatoes. The run meets in Papago park and the course takes you onto the canal just south of McDowell Rd. Starts at 9am so it's not too early either.
5	I have completed this run (obviously not the 27th annual edition) 5 times now. The course is always the same - a bit hillier than other Papgo courses as it takes a right along the sidewalk behind the zoo, but the organization is always excellent. The t-shirt is another good draw to this event - a long sleeve shirt that changes color in the sun. There is always food at the end, a raffle, and a great crowd. One of the best events on the racing calendar each year and an excellent way to start the new year off right!
