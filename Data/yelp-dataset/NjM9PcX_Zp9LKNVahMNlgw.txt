5	I have purchased and sold gold and silver at B J's . Both buying and selling was very easy. They take the time to educate and explain the items I were selling . After research I found the prices are very fair.  I have found some very desirable investment coins there and every transaction has been easy..  I also like the limits on the amount of customers allowed in at any one time and being Buzzd in and out make the transactions more secure.    I am and will be a repeat customer for years to come...
5	I am in love with this place. BJ is extremely knowledgable and the staff is very friendly and helpful.
