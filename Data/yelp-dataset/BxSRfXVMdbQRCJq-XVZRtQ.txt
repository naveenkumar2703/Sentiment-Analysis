5	I have gone here off and on for a few years. I am a tomboy who wears her hair in a ponytail 80% of the time, so sometimes I just go to Great Clips or a friend with a steady hand for a trim. But when I splurge on a good haircut and/or color I go to Jorge at Regis. He always does an amazing job even with my difficult texture. When he colored my hair it was soooo luminous and beautiful.But what I really love is that my mother goes to him. My mother hasn't had her hair professionally done in about 30 years. She is a beautiful woman but never really cared about spending money on herself. After a tough divorce, she decided to get professional cuts and styling advice. Jorge really helped transform her hair and gave her so much confidence! He treated her like she was his own mother. Thanks Jorge!
5	Yeah, Im a straight guy who goes to Regis. Its a great place to get a hair cut. Who doesnt like a shampoo and scalp massage along with a trim??Havent had a bad stylist yet. Shawna is very good and always delivers.
5	Regis Salon will give you a very personable and exceptional experience. Everyone will remember you and will always serve to give you the best hair cut, style, and color. They also wax eyebrows, and actually listen to you. You say not too thin, they won't do it thin. You say only cut a trim, they only cut a trim. I'm picky with my hair, and only trust a few people, everyone here I can trust although I do personally love Giti here.
4	I entrusted Brittany with my hair styling telling her what I was looking for and allowing her to work her magic.  She conferred with my wife and between the two of them I now have a great hair style that even I like
5	Highly recommend Caroline for eyebrow waxing. Nice touch, great attitude, & funny!(Highly recommend not being Indian if you want to avoid eyebrow waxing.)
