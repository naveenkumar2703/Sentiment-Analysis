5	Excellent property, very clean and my belongings are safe. Friendly and professional staff. Lots of hell from the day we moved in! I'd highly recommend this property.
5	Jasmine and Josh were great to work with and very helpful. Thank you for your service.
5	We reviewed several storage options in Las Vegas for a 10x15 space to store furniture, etc. We were fairly confident that we'd be renting storage at another location and were doing due diligence to make sure it was a good deal. Turns out that while it was a good deal, this place was better! Clean, well lit and air conditioned at a better price! And Deesa was very helpful and genuine - much appreciated! So we switched over to this location and the move-in was painless and quick. Would recommend them as a good value and a place that treats customers well.
