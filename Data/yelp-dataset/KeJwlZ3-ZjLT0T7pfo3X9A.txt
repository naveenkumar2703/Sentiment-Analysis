5	I have come here for two oil changes and a smog test. Their prices are affordable and even when they are busy they still maintain great customer service and timely work. Extra bonus: if you get an oil change, you get a free car wash at any of their car wash locations that is valid for 14 days.
1	DO NOT buy gas here. They will take your cash and refuse to pump gas. Filing a police report now.
1	Poor Service, the workers are horrible, they dont even know how to work the registars.Went to get gas, was with my brother in his truck, gave them my card to put 50 dollars on, i didnt know he had deisel so when they asked what type of gas i told them regular unleaded. Then had to return back in to change the type of gas. They couldnt cancel my card then tried to rerun my card for another 50 dollars . If failed for some reason then said i had to pay with cash because i cant use my card again. So i take out 40 from atm to get the gas and come to find out they still charged me the 50 dollars.
