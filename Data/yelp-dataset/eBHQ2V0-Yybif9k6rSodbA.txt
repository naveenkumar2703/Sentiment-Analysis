3	This Goodwill is no superstore; perhaps only a little bigger than your average strip mall store like GameStop.  It still seems to always have a revolving section of new and amusing things to buy.   The staff is always helpful, and there are never less than 6 Kenny Rogers LPs in the music section.
2	I was on a thrift store junket the other day - hitting about 6 different stores in a single afternoon. Although this store is the closest to my house, in the 8 years I've lived in Vegas, I think I've only bought one thing here - granted that was a super sweet 1960s "Las Vegas Story" souvenir 45 rpm record with uber-cool graphics.  That said though, this teeny Goodwill is jam packed with cast off clothing from the 1990s - nothing particularly cool or vintage. The shelved items are generally in disarray and the store seems particularly, um, fragrant and stuffy.  I'll stop in maybe once or twice a year, but I generally don't enjoy shopping at this location.
4	Cheap crap!? YES!Sooo Im a thrift store shopper, and am not afraid to tell you! Now I dont really buy clothing, but I love books, and knick knacks from here! This store isnt huge, and its a lot more quaint but the customer service here is wonderful! The cashiers are sooooo kind and sooo sooo patient! Plus on Tuesdays casino employees and players card members get 20% off! SCHWING! They have many great finds, books, bags, and even sometimes kitchenware! They are not exorbitantly priced like other places! Like I said it small so its easy to navigate through!My son always find little guns and crap and I found a gnarly Electric Brand backpack for 3$!!Go get your cheap on here!
1	I have been here several times. They never have anything decent, the store looks dirty and so do the merchandise. Every time I come here, I think I was being unreasonable but no, this is the most awful good will store I have ever been to.Cheap? Yes. Full of junk? Yes. Dirty? Yes. Crowded? Yes.
