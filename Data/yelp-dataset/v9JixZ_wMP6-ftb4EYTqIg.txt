5	Reliable late night or lunch spot the past few times I've been here or had food that my friends picked up. Didn't run out of rice for the chicken teriyaki bowl, unlike some crappy spot on Sunset at Arroyo Grande. Check it out, service was pretty fast even at around 4:30 in the morning.
2	Meh. Kind do disappointed. Burgers and curly fries tasted good, but everything was just warm. If I could have microwaved everything to heat it up, I would probably give two more stars.
