4	I used to live right around the corner from Lucky's and it was somewhat of a Friday night tradition to pick up a pizza and some of their amazing wings. The restaurant itself really isn't anything special, they have booths and a tv in there, but it's definitely a take out kind of place. Their food, however, is really good. I am not a huge wing fan, but I absolutely love the wings here. They are almost a bit crunchy and the sauce is unlike any that I have ever had before. The perfect kick, but not too spicy for my sensitive stomach. They have great lunch specials and dinner deals too, so stop in if you are craving some "real" pizza and not just the quick production pizza hut stuff.
5	OK been ordering here the last 3 mos now and will prob continue. The first time was before moving and they offered to help us move if we needed the muscle. That goes way above normal customer service if you ask me. Last month we ordered for the fights it was a bit late and their driver already went home for the night so dude makes his gf deliver to us. We had been driving around Jerome all day and barely made it back in time for UFC. Anyways they saved the night. They were out of fresh basil so he did tomato and fresh garlic. I dont really like strong garlic tastes or smells but this pizza was awesome!!! They will pretty much make you anything you want too.The other night we ordered but we had run out of beer  so guess what. They charged us for a six pack and picked one up on the way!! This place rawks harder than any chigiddy chain chain!!!
