4	I brought in my $29 worth of penny rolls. Teller was helpful with no judgments and made little conversation with me. I like when tellers genuinely ask how I'm doing rather than saying it like going through the motions. also great eye contact.
5	Great customer service from Bofa Banker Gladis! Very thoughtful and took great care in helping me with my questions.
2	I usually like BoA and have banked here for over 13 years but recently they seem to have gone downhill. I just walked in to this branch and there are 3 people to say hi to you, standing around doing nothing but saying hello and only 1 teller behind the glass helping people waiting in line. Also, my ATM card is worn out so I asked for a replacement and they want to charge me.
5	If you have the chance to deal with Sorina, do it!She helped my girlfriend and I set up her bank account (she's German), and Sorina was SO helpful in the whole process. She's also a notary in Illinois and notarized a couple of things we needed while we were at her desk. Seriously, I almost never think of a bank as "my bank"... I usually pick which ever one is closest at the time, but because of Sorina, I will absolutely go to this bank anytime I have to do anything more than just withdraw or deposit. All thanks to Sorina always being helpful, even recognizing us when we come in and coming over to ask how we are doing or if we need anything! Just wonderful customer service. Thank you Sorina!
1	I always have to wait 30 min, its like Walmart all over again, 10 people in line 2 employees and the manager... Should have to wait so long...
