3	Their service is slow....the tellers don't really seem to care and its always kinda stinky in this location...but the reason it gets 3 stars is the PEOPLE WATCHING. The people here are never dull (it usually looks like something out of People of Walmart.com). My favorite was some old dude...and I mean really old...wearing a cap that said SOB...Sexy old bastard. My man commented that he hoped he was that cool when he was old. So if you are in the area and you use Citibank to fulfill your banking needs...pop on in...you won't be disappointed.
4	The branch is easy to find right on Maryland Parkway. The people are extremely friendly and helpful. Letty, who works with small businesses, is very knowledgeable and personable. She is extremely helpful.
3	Not the most exciting place on earth. People are okay, nice enough. Never seen this location busy. Great branch if you don't like lines but tellers are gong to work faster than their hourly rate of pay. Not too happy with their exchange rates for foreign currency conversions but the insult to injury is the flat fee they tack on top of the spread, the fee for doing the conversion
4	My fav branch! The location is horrible! However the customer service here couldn't be beat!  I needed to open a second account and the manager called an employee from his lunch early to help me. I tried to explain that was not needed I was in no rush. They insisted, so I sat down with a gentlemen who explained everything to me and even set the account up for me online. Super friendly! I'll be banking here from now on.
