5	I stumbled upon this store at the Las Vegas Outlet Center one day when I was doing a little bit of shopping. It was like finding a men's retail paradise! LOL - no seriously! Sean John is one of the hottest menswear lines and here was an OUTLET store for it! The deals were insane! Jeans $30, tees 2 for $20, etc.... What I loved the most, was it was the same product in the department stores not out of season useless stuff. I'm the kinda man that likes to look good and I work hard for my money so I'm always trying to get the most for the least! The salesperson helped me put a dapper outfit together for that evening's events and I grabbed a few more outfits simply because of how inexpensive they were! Who cares about a recession when they're prices are this good!

Sometimes, they even leave the back door open so you can see the employee area, it's dirty as well. So basically, it's dirty.On the otherhand, if you can look that over, they have some nice items here. My man really likes the jeans here, so we got a few of them. They were on sale for $20 each. What a good deal! There weren't too many sizes, but we got what we wanted.Overall, I would overlook the dirtiness of this place and go in just to see what kind of deals they may offer, especially if you like this style of clothing.
5	I am obsessed with this brand! Love it! I found it last year in Miami and now in Las Vegas. I also found cool stuff in Burlington... The only negative comment I have was the guy at the store. Not cool at all... But I still like the clothes VERY MUCH!
