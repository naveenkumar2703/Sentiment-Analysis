1	The repairs my relative received from Floyd's via Doug were not only questionable at best but cause more problems to her vehicle. I would not recommend setting foot in this "repair center".
2	I took my beloved Subaru Baja to Floyd's last May, and had possibly the worst transmission rebuild imaginable. They were very nice and professional, which is good because they can't fix AWD transmissions, apparently. I dropped the car off and got the ok to pick it up about a week later. I went down to pick it up and the transmission was malfunctioning in the exact way it was that caused me to bring it in in the first place. No big deal, but they did this three more times over the month or so they had my car. Each time they assured me that they had tested it out extensively and that it was shifting better than ever. I couldn't imagine they had actually tested it, because the car was still SLAMMING into second gear. Hard enough to burn rubber. They were very nice about it each time and didn't charge me any extra for the transmission work they had to do beyond the initial repair and they even fixed some other things free of charge, but I brought the car home after a month or so and they'd finally repaired the problem, but it never shifted as good as it did before and had a lot of cooling issues. I ended up selling the car and buying a truck. I don't know if I'd ever bring a car to Floyd's again, but if I did, it would not be AWD.
2	Nice guys, terrible work. I took my 03 Subaru Baja there and after more than a month of issues, finally took it home and had nothing but problems after. Doug called me three or four times saying it was fixed and that he tested it vigorously. After driving to Tempe, the car still had the same shifting problems, as if he never test drove it at all. I don't know about normal cars, but if you have an AWD car, go somewhere else.
