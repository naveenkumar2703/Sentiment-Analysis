2	Let me start off by saying this... Any established marine, boat repair joint that has a lot, warehouse or shop, a multitude of employees, and parts on hand that requires inventory, has to make a certain amount of money to stay in business, pay their rent, and make payroll to their employees. That being said, I haven't found, nor heard of a reputable boat/marine repair joint that doesn't over charge. OK... That being said, I have taken my boat (s) here twice now for some extensive work, and both times the estimate came out to be over twice the amount I was quoted. Yeah- They seem to to do very good work. But, if a plumber came over and told me it was 200 bucks to put in a new sink, and then finished and said it was going to be 600 dollars, I'd be frickin' outraged! This is the way it is with these places, and this is how it's been BOTH times I have taken my watercraft to this establishment. Won't be returning.

Ed is as honest and genuine as anyone you will ever meet and makes sure that his clients are taken care of.  If you are looking for great service for your boat, look no further. I like the name of the place too (no relation!).
