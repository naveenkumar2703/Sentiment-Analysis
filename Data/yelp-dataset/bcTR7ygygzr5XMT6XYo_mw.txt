4	As far as record/cd stores go, this one is deep. What I mean is they have a huge selection of everything new and used. This location was previously Warehouse and it shows. The best selection of used music in town! Looking for that hard to find cd cheap? Come here first.
2	Terrible customer service, if you're selling you should look elsewhere.  I hadn't sold to this store before so they asked to see my ID which the manager walked off with and left on the counter next to the CDs I wanted to sell.  She did not communicate this to her subordinate and I had to ask how long it was going to be just to get this kid to look at them.  This guy was a real piece of work, he couldn't decide how long it was going to take him and gave me estimates varying from 15 to 60 minutes and suggested I leave and come back, but failed to return my ID until I pointed out that I wasn't going to leave without it.  He called my about 15 minutes later and said he was done and suggested I return to the store sooner rather than later as if it's some sort of emergency.  When I got back I decided to accept their offer and Einstein here gave me $3 instead of $23 and then had to call his manager to get the register open again.  He apologized and said it had been a long day.  I pointed out that it was only noon and he responded that he'd been up since 6.  Six hours is a long day?Went to the Fye in Tempe (Apache and Rural) and had a better experience.
5	The customer service today was nothing short of amazing.   The associate Katie helped us find exactly what we were looking for.  She was very friendly and knowledgeable.The selection is huge, it is the perfect place to find that movie or CD you didn't know that you needed.  Prices on used products are very reasonable and the non media products such as shirts and toys are great for movie and music lovers. This is my favorite place to shop for movies.
