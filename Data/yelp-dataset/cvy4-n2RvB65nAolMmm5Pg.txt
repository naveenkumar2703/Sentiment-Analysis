1	I was desperate. Earlier this week, I had a dental procedure and needed to get a prescription filled. I pulled up this store on my iPhone by using the Yelp app.It took these bastards an HOUR to fill up ONE easy peazy prescription. I am from out of town. It was slow. They had three pharmacists on staff. How the hell does it take ONE HOUR to fill up 20 pills? I was in obvious pain. What was wrong with these people? The worst part? I was already in their system. There shouldn't have been any delays.Next time I will go out of my way to find a Walgreens, or even a Walmart. At least if I am in Vegas.The only pro? 24 hours.
4	I love this CVS, it is always open and has filled my last minute needs numerous times. It is not super fancy, but is clean and provides pleasant customer service.
3	Stopped in here to pick up a few things we forgot to pack for our Vegas trip. We were in the neighborhood at the Tuxedo Junction and saw it in the same strip mall.Being from NJ, where you can only buy beer, wine and liquor from a "liquor store" we were surprised to see 18 packs of beer stacked at the end of the aisles, and bottles of vodka as well as other liquors in the liquor section. So we stocked up on coors light and absolut in addition to some trial size travel goodies we needed. Much cheaper than what we would have paid at the hotel.Prices weren't bad on the booze but was shocked to see them charge over 4 dollars for a bottle of CVS store brand cranberry juice cocktail.
5	Pharmacy staff is always polite, helpful and working hard. Love 24 hour service
2	This is a good size store, unfortunately it was the ONLY one I knew of a n the area which would develop actual film anymore, & they have removed that service. Not in the best area of town so there are always homeless hanging out in the parking lot & considering there's a weapon store I'd beside it that's a bit bothersome
