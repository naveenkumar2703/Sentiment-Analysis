5	Awesome  chicken. I buy at least two to three chicken deals when I visit. It still never lasts very long.  So good.
5	Food is simple and delicious! Get ready to get your hands dirty. There's no forks necessary here.  Rotiserie chicken, a simple salsa, warm tortillas, and canned/bottled drink. Love it!The salsa is simple and tangy. It can hardly be called spicy, but quite tasty. They also have roasted jalapenos, pickled purple onion, and go at it. When you order your options are a whole chicken or 1/2 chicken. The cook will chop it into pieces for you.  The place is covered with the color orange, casual, indoor and outdoor dinning with a small tv for a spanish soap opera.
5	Heard about Pollo Correteado through some friends on the 4th of July. Of course, I had to go about the next day to try it. I'm always searching for the next great foodie venture. We call to place an order, but there were about to close. They were kind enough to way an additional 15 minutes for us to drive over for our Take out order. We paid (there's a sign that says Cash only) and when we got back into the car, the smell of the food was AMAZING. Note, I'm not sure if this a Mexican or Peruvian food, but it is AMAZING! We got home and opened up that delicious meal! The chicken was rotiserie, the tortillas might have been home made, the onions were amazing, the salsa was fresh with the perfect amount of heat, they used white beans, and their Mash potatoes were not what you would expect... THEY WERE BOMB.comYou're welcome in advance if you used my review to lead you to this tiny little jewel!
