5	I've been to this place 3 times and it's always fun to get new work boots. JR measures your feet and has you walk around outside to make sure they won't hurt after a while. He tells corny jokes but they are funny and he greets you with a candy bar. You will not leave unsatisfied. If you do he does not mind swapping them for something that better suits your needs.
5	Extremely nice and helpful guy! Got the boots that worked for me, no pressure, just helpful. Loved the candy bar too  =]
5	Unbelievable experience, I'm from New England and this is the first time I left a store to buy boots where the service was impeccable. Very knowledgable and a great sense of humor .Take care JR, and thank you.
