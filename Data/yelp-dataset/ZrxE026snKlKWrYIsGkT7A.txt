1	This school seems to overly teach to the test leaving overall student learning an afterthought.  Maybe this is just the way schools are now a days, but without a developed sports and arts program there are simply better options nearby.
1	This school is ran very poorly.  Teachers are good but administration is terrible.  If there's any kind of major issue such as bullying or harassment the principal will do nothing about it.  In fact she will get defensive and lose her temper at parent/student filing a complaint.  I'm very relieved to have my child moving on to bigger and better things.
5	Teachers are amazing. The teachers,and  principal really care. Well run school. My son loves this school. Drop off and pick up are perfect. Thanks Cambridge Academy for your hard work.
