5	Frank and Fred are the best... I bought both my cars with these guys and they also service them too... No hassle auto sales!!!
4	First of all I never give five stars, so four stars is my superior rating.  We have bought four cars there and none of them have been disappointing.  Frank and Fred are scrupulously honest and are in this to build customer loyalty.  We have referred family and friends there and they too have been happy.  It's important to realize that the cars are used and come as is.  There will be some glitches.  If that's a problem, then buy a new car.  Or buy a car from F&D and spend the difference on something else.
1	Great...At first. The only reason I bought my car here was because I knew maintenance is expensive for BMWs and I was told don't worry just bring it to us, we fix it. And they did at very honest prices, I was always pleased and gave praises to both Fred & Frank. I told friends and family, etc., however, as time goes on, each time I called up about a repair/problem I got  the feeling of just being tolerated, a horrible feeling. I was always grateful for their help, never complained about anything. I am a business owner and would never treat any customer that way. It's the main reason I choose to buy my new car elsewhere. They eventually pawn me off elsewhere. I have spent thousands in repairs on this car elsewhere, it's not worth it. Unless you have a warranty be prepared to put major money away for maintenance.
