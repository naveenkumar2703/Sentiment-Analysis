1	I completely agree with the other review here.  I legitimately thought it would be an Oktoberfest and not a San Tan Fest.  If it's ONLY going to be San Tan beer and sub par food if not horribly done "german food" (bratwurst ONLY) then hold it at the end of September and call it something completely different.  Omit Oktoberfest from the name, because that was NOT an Oktoberfest.  I will continue on with every other Oktoberfest in the state from now on, as I now know the quality of the San Tan Oktoberfest.P.S. My boyfriend has been waiting to go to this Oktoberfest for 4 years and has not been able to go since he used to bartend weekends that caused him to be unable to go.  PLUS, his favorite beers on and off are the Devils Ale and the Hop Knot.  I am not going to lie, he was CRUSHED when he went to this event. He had built this up to be at least a quarter of a typical Oktoberfest in his mind, and it did not deliver at WHATSOEVER. I will not subject him to this event again and when he said he'd rather go to the ballet, he meant it.  Try again San Tan.
4	It's SanTans version of Oktoberfest. Sorry not a warehouse full of German beers. I guess why they called it Santan Oktoberfest.  They have great beer it's sad you can't find their beer in every store locally. Overall the festival was great.

5	Yelp presence was cool, got some goodies.
