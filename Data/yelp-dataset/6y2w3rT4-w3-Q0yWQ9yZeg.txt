1	Yogurt was yummy, but their pricing is very deceiving.  They have a large $.39/oz sign, but it is really $.45/oz.  They claim it averages out to .$.39/oz because when you buy 10, you get 8 oz. free.  But that would only be true if you only got 8 oz. each time.  They just need to be honest... It is $.45 an ounce.  Don't be deceiving!!!  I give it 1 star for that reason.
1	Rude staff, bad tasting yogurt.
4	Yummy !!!!!! I did salted caramel with lots of unhealthy toppings on it and it tasted sooo good. I've never been able to find a salted caramel flavor before !! :) must go back again.
5	Lots of rewards and discounts. Great tasting yogurt. Have no problems with the staff.
5	Best spot in town! Great reward program
