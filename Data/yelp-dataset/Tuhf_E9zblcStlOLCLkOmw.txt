5	I have only been to this park for Great Taste of the Midwest, and it is absolutely gorgeous. Hilly, great view of the city, and beautiful lake front views. Would definitely return if I lived in the area!
4	This was an awesome site to go walking while on breaks from work in the area. The foot trails running along the lake are beautiful, and taking a walk over to the bike / walking paths gives you a great workout through a bunch of scenery along the river. A lovely resource that I wish more people were taking advantage of - I hardly saw anyone there over a three day stay!
