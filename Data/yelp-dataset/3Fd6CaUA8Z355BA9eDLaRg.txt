4	If you are bored with looking at ten-a-penny cashmere in tourist traps, then head on down to the Grassmarket where Hawick makes cashmere classy.A cool, contemporary fashion outlet in the heart of the pretty Grassmarket, Hawick's has a hundred years long history but has moved with the times to continuously stay en vogue. It is a very sleek store selling only the best modern cashmere designs. From batwing jumpers to legwarmers and gloves, this store is everything you wouldn't expect of a cashmere store in Edinburgh. It's fresh, up to date and sells bold statement clothing. The colours and fabric are rich and vibrant - clothing of quality that will last a lifetime! The clothing design is modern, simple and elegant.It's fairly expensive but a breath of fresh air. It exceeds expectations of what you would expect from a cashmere shop, and blows all over (stuffier) competitors out of the game. Without a doubt, this is of a higher class.

The price tags are as steep as HN and the fashion in this boutique is just as high end. Everywhere you look there's beautifully designed tunic tops, wrap coats, puffball dresses and roll collars cardigans in bold colours from midnight blue and burnt orange to charcoal black. If I had the money, I'd definitely cut loose and pick up a dozen stripey scarves, long gloves and swing coats to get me through the cold winter. Sadly, I don't. (:
