2	Went to this day spa on a recent trip to phoenix for a massage and facial.  The facial was ok, but the massage was not.  The masseur was not engaged, did not have a technique, and talked non-stop.  It was a limp massage and a waste of time and money.  The menu of services was not clear, so the cost was more than anticipated.  If you go here, ask many questions about the "upgrades" and "specials."  In my humble opinion, I was charged more than I should have been but they didn't see it that way.  I hate leaving a spa feeling ripped off.

My esthetician, Kate was friendly, warm and very professional.      The facial was very thorough and I left feeling hydrate, glowing and pampered.  She listened to my concerns and asked many questions to ensure that I got the facial that would meet my needs.One note, this salon in located in Sun City Grand.  The majority of the clientele is 55+ in age.  I am no where near that age bracket. As a result most of their treatments are geared to more mature skin, but there was no problem accommodating me!Overall its an excellent spa that I will go back to again!!
