5	I went and saw Dr. Eckel for the first time back in April.  He and ValleyOB/GYN came highly recommended from quite a few co-workers who have him as their OB/GYN.  There's 2 offices.  The one off Shea and the one off Osborn.  My appointment was at the Shea office.  In a nutshell, his staff is fantastic and he is wonderful!  I had a few things I wanted looked into, since my old OB/GYN office dropped the ball back in 2009.  He addressed my concerns, wrote out the referrals I needed, and in the end...everything turned out A-OK!  I look forward to having Dr. Eckel as my OB, not just my GYN!  :)
2	I don't know what to do, I was referred to Dr. Eckel when I moved to the valley but their secretary does not answer the phones during business hours. Several messages have not been returned and I feel bad because now we are going somewhere else. I'm sure he is a great doc from what I've heard but if he has incompetent staff and is hard to get a hold of that is a deal breaker :(
5	So, a year after posting my review for Dr. Eckel...I'm now pregnant.  16 weeks to be exact as of today.  Its been nothing but a wonderful experience!  My husband really likes Dr. Eckel and the entire staff, which means a lot.  Any questions you may have outside of an appointment, they're quick to get back to you.  And Dr. Eckel deliver's about 85% of his patients babies.  To quote my husband, "I believe we got ourselves a 'Dr. Huxtable'!"
5	I was already a patient of Dr. Eckle when I suffered a miscarriage. He is fabulous. When I got in to see him, he took my concerns very seriously and sat with me and my husband in his office to go over possible reasons and preventions. He immediately wrote me a prescription for Progesterone and said when I finally get pregnant to call him immediately. He always takes his time when discussing my health and I appreciate it more than words can say. His nurses are wonderful, too. He is a great doctor and someone I highly recommend.
