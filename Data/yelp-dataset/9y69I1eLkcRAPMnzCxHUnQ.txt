5	We went here attracted to the grand opening banner that advertised $1 hot dogs and $2 burgers.  That sounded yummy, so we decided to check it out.  Pulling up I noticed they advertised real charcoal grilling and sure enough they cook everything to order on a charcoal grill behind the counter.   We were not asked how we wanted the items cooked, but the man cooking the food had been interacting with us, so I asked him to make my two hot dogs well done and he made the perfectly.  The toppings for the hot dogs and burgers looked fresh.  We ordered the macaroni and cheese which was also delicious.  I really wasn't expecting much other than a plain ole' hot dog, but it was really, really good.  We enjoyed the TV's that were playing, they are excellent quality and the world cup was on.
4	We started off here, by going to Maui Dog, which was closed due to an 8am burglary. Then we tried to keep the Hawaiian theme, and decided to go to Ono Hawaiian Grill. But upon walking into Ono and being overwhelmed by a sewage smell, we quickly turned around and walked in to On the Grill.I went with the Chicken and Apple Sausage (which was a nice find because so few places will carry this). The sausage was tasty, and the condiments (lettuce, tomato, relish, etc..) all seemed to be fresh and presented nicely. The Fries were good as well. Nothing over the top here, just pretty good food. No complaints from me. The staff was very friendly, and jovial. I will go back if I'm ever in the neghborhood.
4	Really good place to eat. Burgers are good and the sandwiches too. Their hot dogs are grilled not steamed, way better that way.  The owner is real a real hospitable, friendly guy.
