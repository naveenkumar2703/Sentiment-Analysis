5	I had so much fun in this place.  I especially like the things that was done with a pop of color.   If you love antiques and one of a kind finds then go check it out.
4	I found the most amazing vintage flight attendant bag for $18.
4	A great little shop to stop by if you are antiquing in Phoenix. Lots of interesting pieces for a reasonable price. They even offer delivery if you aren't able to transport your newly bought treasures. The owner was very nice and helpful. You can tell she loves what she does and wants to share the joy of the objects in her store.
5	Found this gem and so happy I did.  Fantastic place.  The owner is amazing, she is full of inspiring ideas.  She had no problem staying in budget and taking extra time to help with ideas.  She is super accommodating, patient, and willing to wholeheartedly help the customer. This is my new favorite place and I intend to be a repeat customer.  Her inventory is so fun!
2	I was completely in love with this place until I saw the owner out at a community yard sale. The worst was the mark up after overhearing what she actually pays for items and then seeing what she sells them for.Cool finds, interesting idea's. Workmanship is questionable for over priced garage sale finds. Cool place to get idea's.
5	Loved this place! It's filled with amazing, old books - great for decorating but also for collecting. I bought a book that had an inscribed note dated back to 1906!The owner truly is passionate about vintage finds. She also has great tips and is funny. Cool place to check out and see what you end up with :-)
