5	I hate going to mechanics!! However, Bumper to Bumper was recommended to me by a friend and I've had only good experiences there. I took my car in for a basic repair that only cost me $25, but I expected to pay around $100 for it. I'm glad they were honest and didn't try to upsell me anything...they just fixed what was wrong and did it as inexpensively as possible. Highly recommended!
5	What an amazing experience I had here today!  As a single female who knows very little about cars I am always nervous that I am going to be charged for repairs I have no clue what it even is or if it was done.  Ed Rapp took such good care of me I would recommend these guys to anyone and I wont take my car anywhere else.  My finances are tight right now and he did a minor repair to buy me some time until I could afford the real repairs on my car.  They adjusted belts and topped off the fluids in my car and only charged me for 1 hour of labor.  Fair and very trustworthy repair shop!  Ladies this is the place for you and Ed is a guy you can trust!!!!
5	Yet ANOTHER great experience here!  I drive an OLD car and it is a major money pit right now but Ed took care of me again while I waited!  I didn't even have an appointment but my car died on me again today and he got me back on the road!!!  Can't express enough how much I appreciate their honesty and speed!!!  Thanks!!!!
5	Very friendly and quick service, and gave me an alternative to fix my window which fell down and wouldn't roll back up.  Something I could afford, even though my window won't roll down anymore.  I'll take it.   Even topped off my brake fluid without asking, as it was low, and didn't charge me for that.  Thanks, Bumper to Bumper, I'll be back, hopefully not anytime soon.
