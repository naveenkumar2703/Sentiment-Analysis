5	Quick. Friendly. Professional. And quality! Everything I look for in a dry cleaner!
5	Professional. Fast. Friendly. And helpful. The girls were knowledgable and the boy was efficient. Will be a regular stop in my errands!
4	I use these guys when I stay on this side of town; love the quick turnaround.  Staff if very polite and do their very best to let you leave happy;  the last time I was there I hadn't been in for at least a month and they not only remembered who I was by name but were able to pull me up in the system without asking for my phone number; As far as this type of business is concerned they are top notch and so are there employees; I will use them every time I'm on this side of town and thank you for your hard work and dedication in making me look so good!
4	I've been going here 10 years and haven't had any issues.  Yes, they've lost some stuff but gave me an gift card to make things right.  Staff is friendly and courteous.
4	They are great. I have gotten to know the young ladies that work there. They will sew a button on if I need them to. When all my clothes are done they will call and let me know that I can come and pick my clothes up. They do nice things for me.Probably the best place for dry cleaners if your in the nightclub industry!
2	I was just told that they do not want my money. I asked for extra services and none of them were completed. Kind of silly that I was willing to pay their prices with no questions asked and they couldn't be bothered to do the work as request.Also, no one at any location knows how to ring up gift cards.
