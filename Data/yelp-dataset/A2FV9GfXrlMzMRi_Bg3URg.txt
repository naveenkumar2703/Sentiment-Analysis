4	Good store, same as any other Big Lots.  They all seem pretty consistent.  Bit of a "desperation & despair" feeling in there from the employees and clientele, but if you don't mind trailer trash, the deals are the same as any Big Lots.
5	Chris B was kinda mean or maybe I don't mind trailer trash. Maybe I am the desperate & despair trailer trash he described in his review. WTF Anyway I love Biglots because I can find discounted: Rock Stars Drinks $12 a case, Perrier $1 and my favorite imported olive oil $6. I'm not sure if that makes me trailer trash but I'm sure frugal!  ** Also home decor items/furniture from Peir at 1/3 of the normal price.Love this place!
4	Cheap.. Hit or miss but cmon.. It's that kind of store . Always have the dog bagels that my pup has to have.. People are friendly..
3	My husband & I were about to set up our Christmas tree when we realized NONE of our lights worked! It sucked because we seriously had like 200 feet of lights. Ugh, WTF-they worked 2 years ago (we were on our honeymoon last year so didn't put them up)!! We decided to come to Big Lots in hopes of getting some new lights for cheap. I have never been to this location before. I used to go to the 1 on 67th ave & Cactus because it was in the same complex as my hubby's office & I would have to pick him up sometimes. I went there so much I would buy shit I didn't need so I stopped that habbit & haven't been to 1 for like 3 years or so. Well this trip was not a cheap 1 like I had hoped. We saw tons of cool lights & decorations for the house & ended up spending $130 all on Christmas stuff! I don't think I would have come here just to shop randomly though, prices weren't really that cheap & the quality was low. I would much rather shop at Target.
5	location is moving so ***** BIG LOT LOVERS come on down 40-80% off entire store... bell and 7th street only
5	Oh Big Lots, you loveable junk store.  We all know why we go there; some off-brand cleaning products, lawn gnomes, a poly-blend tablecloth you will only use once or twice....So why write a review about Big Lots.  Because Big Lots usually looks & smells  like monkeys got loose in the store.  Not this store.  This one is new, and rather nice.  Things in their place, and still the good pricing.  You never know what you are going to get in a Big Lots, but this one was a pleasant surprise.  I will drive out of my way to go to this store.  I hope they keep it nice.  I never know when I may need some fabuloso or some other random stuff.
1	Prices here are crazy high for being a big lots. I'll give them that the store inside looks nice and they have many things to choose from compare to other big lots, but $15 for a pillow? When I can get the same one at Target or Walmart..Methinks not.
3	I like Big Lots for the name brand stuff that the grocery stores charge an arm and a leg for. $2 for Triscuits, now that's what i'm talking about. I've been to the stores in Tempe and Scottsdale. I prefer the Scottsdale location because it seems to have more variety, but a savings is a savings.
4	Don't knock the Lots. Fun and funky, and tacky decor galore. Plus one time my roommate bought a whole box of beer shampoo. Sadly there was no matching beer conditioner. We also used to do something called Adventure Snacking where we'd go to Big Lots or the local dollar store and buy the weirdest edible things we could find. We're still alive, but we were pushing our luck. More seriously, though, I have picked up emergency coolers for camping trips, a decent futon frame, and a vacuum cleaner with so many bells and whistles I'm pretty sure it was from the future at Big Lots. I like my bargains to come with surprises.
3	As with most locations, this one seems to have really pleasant employees.  The deals are always decent if you are looking for bath and beauty supplies, or holiday decorations.  We sometimes buy cat toys from here also since they are spoiled babies.This particular location seemed smaller and more crowded with products than some of the other locations. Certain sections were in need of some cleanup / organization.  It wasn't terrible, and we are approaching the holidays, so I know stores are having a harder time with the uptick in traffic flow, so I didn't hold this against them too much.I didn't purchase anything, but I was pretty focused on searching out more desk decor for the holidays and nothing seemed to strike my fancy this go around.  On the way out though I did notice that the cashier was very friendly to the lady checking out and she did stop to tell me to have a nice day - which was nice!Overall: B+Some minor issues here, but not a bad stop off if you are in the area already!
4	My wife & I stopped here today. They were not very busy. The other day (on the weekend) we went by the store while we were out & about and the parking lot was packed.I forgot how much I enjoy exploring Big Lots merchandise and looking for closeout bargains.This place has everything from food to kitchenware, utensils, dishes, pots & pans, flatware, electronics, decorations to furniture. ALL at bargain basement prices.  ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH
4	The store is very calm not a lot of people in today. Aisles are nice and tidy and best of all customer service is on point! There isn't employees watching your every move or constantly asking if there is something that I need and personally I like to be able to shop in peace and that is exactly what I'm doing here. Music is very Christmas spirt like I love it!
