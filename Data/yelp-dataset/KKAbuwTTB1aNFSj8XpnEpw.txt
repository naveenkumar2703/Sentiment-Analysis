5	I loved my experience at this medspa! I went in for a brow shaping and a facial and was so pleased by the quaint, relaxing and no-pressure environment. The aesthetician I had my appointment with was JoJo. I highly recommend going to see her for your services. My brows have never looked so good, and the facial was an amazingly pampering experience. She is definitely an expert at her craft.
5	I just had eyebrow waxing done and Jojo was great!  She was very professional and the office was clean and cozy.  I would definately recommend this to anyone that needs a waxing, facials, massages, and more.  Also check out the summer specials!
5	JoJo is a fantastic Aesthetician.  She has been waxing my eyebrows and tinting my eyelashes for almost 5 years.  She is flexible with her scheduling and makes you feel like you are the most important person in the world.  My daughter's referred me to her and I am hooked.  I highly recommend taking the time to relax and be pampered with JoJo and her fantastic techniques.Cynthia
5	I have been seeing JoJo Caramello for over 10 years for eyebrow waxing. I will never go to anyone else!! She takes pride in what she does and her appointments never feel rushed. She takes all the time she needs to create the perfect brows for your face! She is very flexible so I can always find something to work with my crazy schedule. I have never been disappointed after an appointment in over 10 years. Would highly recommend!!!
5	I have been going to Jojo to get my eyebrows waxed for about 7 years now, she is amazing. I work in the beauty business and trust no one with my brows except for her. She is the Mona Lisa of eyebrows, thanks Jojo for being so great.
5	Wonderful service, quaint atmosphere and top of the line products.  I see Jojo Caramello for waxing and facials and I'm ALWAYS extremely pleased with my service.  I highly recommend Olos and Arizona Brow Company.
