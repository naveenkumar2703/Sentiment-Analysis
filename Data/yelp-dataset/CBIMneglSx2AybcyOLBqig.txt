2	The reason I give this salon two stars is because I got less for my money than all other pedicures I have gotten. My mom and I got the basic spa pedicure, which was $19. They were done with us in about 15 minutes. They did put lotion on our legs, but just rubbed the lotion in, no massage. They barely cut off any dead skin around the nails and did not buff the foot for calluses at all. The girls were friendly and did a good job on the polish, I just feel like I usually get more for my money. Will not go to again.
