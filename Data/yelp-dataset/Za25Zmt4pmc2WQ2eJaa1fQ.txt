4	Jackie sewed my rather complicated and silly wedding dress and did quite a job with it.  It took 5 fittings and a lot of patience.  She excelled at being cautious with my mother, honest, and quite capable.  If only she was not located in Middleton I'd be taking her a lot more business in the future.
4	Jackie works out of her basement, and is my tailor of choice in the Madison area. Look for the small sign on her house. It's not very easy to see.I've had a suit tailored, sleeves lengthened on a coat, and buttons. She did it all well.
4	I had good experiences with Jackie at Patches and Pieces. I have taken in both my wedding gown and a bridesmaid dress. On the wedding gown, the only thing I needed was a bustle put in and that only ended up being one loop so it was very simple. However, she showed me different options and offered her advice and suggestions. The bridesmaid dress needed to be taken in on the sides and again I think she had good advice and offered her thoughts to make it more fitted while still allowing me to move. I think Jackie has good knowledge and does an excellent job, she is personable and she has great prices. I never feel like I am being taken advantage of like at bridal salons that do tailoring. I would definitely recommend Patches and Pieces.My only negative about the service is that both times I had to call her to find out when my pieces would be finished. I brought them both in well in advance, so I know she ther more pressing pieces. However, both times I called well after the date she told me they would be done and then she would tell me they would be done by the end of the week (they always were). This was fine for me since they were not rushes and she asked when the events were, so she knew they didn't need to be done right away. It's just something to keep in mind that you may need to call about your pieces if the are taking longer then promised.
