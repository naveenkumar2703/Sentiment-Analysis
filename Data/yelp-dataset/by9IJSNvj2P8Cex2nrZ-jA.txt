3	I met some friends at Pebble Park to take some photos. At first glance, it seems to be a rather small park, tucked behind a nursery near Eastern and the 215. There are a couple shaded areas to sit and eat, a playground and a pretty awesome water feature that even I had to play in. The parking lot only had three spots but you can also park along the street. You can walk along a paved path to get to the rest of the park, which is where we saw quite a few people playing with their dogs. The main downside to this park is the of a lack of a bathroom.P.S. Please pick up after your dogs if you go!! No one likes to step in dog crap.

2	I think in the daytime this place would be okay.  Unfortunately, most of my jobs are day jobs so I don't get to go until later...Dusk/Evening - DO NOT GO.  It's downright scary.  There's barely any lights and when I visited I'm pretty sure something not-so-legit was going down in the near-pitch black parking lot.  I guess if you're with a huge group of people and for some odd reason want to hang out that's cool?  But alone - wouldn't suggest.Please put more lights in!
5	Very quite! Not over crowded. Had a pleasant time with my two kiddos. Small fountain for the baby to play in was perfect.
5	Quiet. Very nice change from other parks in the area that are always over crowded. Went at 10:30 with my kids to play on the splash pad and we were the only ones there. Nice natural shade from trees around the ENCLOSED splash pad, as well as the enclosed playground! Big plus for my two year old that likes to run. Kids loved it! So I love it.
5	Nice park, good for dogs and kids. Well lit for nighttime too. Has a water park for the kids. Nice grassy areas for the pups to run.
