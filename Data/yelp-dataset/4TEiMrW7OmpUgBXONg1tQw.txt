5	I love a good buffet!  This one has many selections to choose from.  You can have all the steak you want - no limits there.  Fried shrimp, chicken & dumplings, salads, desserts.  Yum-o!  This is a very traditional American style buffet.  Adults Dinner pricing is approx. $10.99 per person - not too shabby.  Would definitely recommend
1	If you want disgusting food, it can be had much more cheaply. Or for free, out of a trash bin. I suppose if you're only eating once in a while and need to stuff yourself when you do then this place is passable. Personally, I'd rather skip a meal than go here. And yes, American buffets are infamously bad, but even so this place is terrible, and rather dirty. You're better off going into [whatever supermarket is in that plaza now] and buying some food there.
1	I love buffets but this place has gone down hill. I was never really that crazy about this place but it went from about a 2.5 to a 1 since the last time I was here. Mac an cheese was watery, chicken alfredo was blah. Nothing was "bad" it just was not good. They had some enchiladas that looked like they were from a TV dinner..  I managed to find some fish and some smoked sausage that were decent and ended up eating mostly salad as it was fresh.I would not recommend going here and I will not be back anytime soon..
