3	It's a fast food resturaunt.  The fact that the order taking process is confusing is not the fault of the store, but of the corporation.  Maybe they could fix that???Otherwise, they did a good job, got our order right, served in a good time.
1	Dropped by at 12:01 AM. Received product at 12:10 AM. Burger was barely warm and very dry. So much for "hot-and-juicy". The person at the window asked me if I wanted a receipt. I bet they were hoping I would say no. The evidence of when I placed the order was there. Doesn't everyone get a receipt without asking? What a joke. This franchise should be closed ASAP. I contacted Wendy's corporate. They are gonna take your store away soon :)
4	Very friendly while taking my order at the drive through. Food is always hot. Good store.
