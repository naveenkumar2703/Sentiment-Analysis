3	It's hard to rate a synagogue.  As a Reform place goes, this one's OK.  It's a beautiful building and the people are very welcoming.  My only hack is that (IMO) the Reform movement has changed the liturgy to suit their political agenda so much that it's almost sad.
5	Very welcoming and inviting! The taste of Judaism class is very enlightening! Rabbi Akselrad is funny snd informative.
