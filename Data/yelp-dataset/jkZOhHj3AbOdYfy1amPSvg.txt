5	W@W! This place gave me the best Head of my life. Not only was their Head the Radical kind, but it was also oozing with Liquidmetal. I got two Heads just in case my balls break one of my Heads, I have another one. You know what they say, two Heads are better than one. I also love fondling their balls, more so than Wilson's. 3 balls for $1.99 if you're lucky! I have no idea why Wilson's balls are used for tournaments, as these are the only balls I would ever touch. I wish I had a lifetime supply of Head like Agassi does. That lucky bastard.
5	I like Penn tennis balls!  The Penn Heavy Duty and Pro Penn tennis balls are excellent for tennis matches or practice!  (I'm not a fan of Wilson or Wilson U.S. Open tennis balls).
5	I contacted Penn about a case of 24 cans of Pro Penn tennis balls that I had received from a 3rd party retailer.  The issue was that 4 cans of balls had been damaged in transit (they had probably been tossed around in shipping or placed under something very heavy, and the pressurization seal was broken).  I didn't notice this until a few weeks later when I selected the cans to play, (the case appeared normal when it arrived and I didn't bother inspecting each can).  When I called Penn they said this happens sometimes, and the gentleman asked me for a ship-to address and they would send me 4 new replacement cans.  They were very good about resolving this issue without any b.s.  They didn't ask me to send them the defective cans or anything like that, no receipt, just my word.  And they picked up their phones in a timely manner and I didn't have to wait on hold at all.  So I am just writing this to say Kudos to Penn for outstanding customer service.  Thanks!  #winning
