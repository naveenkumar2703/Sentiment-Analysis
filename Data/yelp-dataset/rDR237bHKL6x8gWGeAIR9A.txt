5	As a business owner I need to know the products I request are done to specifications.  These guys are the best.  They always make time to discuss my order and ensure that I get exactly what I want.
2	I ordered Fire Department shirts for a department here in the valley. I ordered these shirts a month or so before I needed them. They have me a date that I could pick them up a week prior to the date I needed them. When I showed up on the date they were said to be finished they said they were busy and I'd have to come back in three days. I was on shift that day so I came in the following day. Guess what, they're still not finished and I'm here writing this post as I wait. I'm giving them two stars just because I'll have them by the time I need them.
