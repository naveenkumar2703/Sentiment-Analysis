4	We were referred by our realtor to this company when we needed a plumber within one week of moving into our new home.  Steve was very courteous on the phone, and apologized for not being able to come out that evening ( it was 3ish when we called) but would be out the next morning first thing.  He called the next morning to make sure it was ok to come out.  Quoted a fair price for the work, and arrived promptly.  He was able to clear the clogged main line quickly, put a camera in the line to show me what was going on, and was very patient explaining everything as he went along.  I would recommend Steve to anyone needing a plumber.
1	Very unprofessional and rude. Acted like he was doing me a favor to replace a water heater. Had enough and got someone else to do the job. As a small business owner, I know if I treated my clients like this, I would have no clients.
1	My usual handyman was sick so he recommended Steve at A-Accent Plumbing to install a new sprayer head for my kitchen faucet. I had already purchased the part so it was (I thought) a simple matter of attaching it. The plumber arrived very promptly - the same day I called. He was finished in 30 minutes, charged me $98 for an hour's labor & left. I thought it was a lot but hey!  He came & fixed my problem quickly. Fast-forward 2 weeks. The sprayer head fell off in my hand. My handyman came to see what was wrong and told me it wasn't installed correctly & he would speak to Steve about the issue. Steve, however, was completely "unresponsive" (handyman's words). No fix, no refund, no nothing. I will NEVER use this company again & will encourage anyone who asks to go elsewhere for their plumbing needs. This is the first negative review I have ever written.
5	These guys have always done a great job for me.  I live in an old house, so it seems like I call them about once a year.
