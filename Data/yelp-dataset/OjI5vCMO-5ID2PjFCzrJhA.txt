2	This Jack in the Box is sub par even for JitB's.  The line is usually slow and the placement in the parking lot makes it accessible only if you're traveling East on Bell; otherwise it's a lot of parking lot to work through to get to it.  You gotta really want JitB.
1	I like Jack in the Box.... but this location is terrible.  Service is very poor and wait times are crazy long.  Tried this location a couple times because the first time i thought maybe i was serviced by a bad employee.   However, after being here more than a few times it became apparent that the crew just is not up to standards.  There is another Jack in the Box just a dash farther away, if I ever get a urge to eat Jack in the Box its worth the extra drive to go to one that actually has good service.
