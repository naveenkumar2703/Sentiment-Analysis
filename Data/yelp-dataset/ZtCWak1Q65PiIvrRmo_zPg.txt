3	I really wish the maintenance was better. Took about a month to get our toilet fixed. There isn't really an emergency # for broken a/c. You will be instructed to call the complex first.   The doggie bags always run out and takes forever to replenish so ppl just allow their dogs their crap all over the place and not pick it up. And now the back gate is broken and open which has been allowing strange people to walk through our complex.
1	Don't rent unit 242. This is privately owned and not one of the thirty units that currently are for rent from the management company. The landlord will not pay for any maintenance while you are renting from him and he will keep your security deposit regardless of the condition of the apt. I paid two hundred dollars to have the place professionally cleaned. I also filled all the holes in the walls with spackle. He claimed he had to have the walls retextured and was keeping my deposit. The hot water in the unit takes about 15 minutes to get from the community boiler which is located in the front of the complex and never exceeds the temperature of 107 degrees. I moved because the maintenance done by the HOA is very slow and the pool is often green before it can be blue. As witnessed by the review before this. I incurred over 300.00 in plumbing expenses in the two years I was there and the owner refused to pay for any of it. Someone climbed the balcony to the second floor and stole my bike. Your parking space is no where near the unit.
