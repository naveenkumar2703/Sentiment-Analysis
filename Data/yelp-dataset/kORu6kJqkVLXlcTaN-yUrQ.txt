5	Nice and bigger than the other stores I've been to. It's perfect for club attire. Very affordable and they just opened recently. A decent selection on heels and service was great; everyone was so helpful.  l will continue to shop at this store.
5	If you've been to the Hottie on Flamingo and Maryland.. You'll appreciate this new location.The inside is huge! Everything is spaced out and you have room to walk around without having your handbag hit the clothes hanging on the racks.Their shoe display is nicely arrange and everything is within view. They've got a good collection on jewelry as well. If you're planning a night out or need a fancy, sexy dress definitely check out Hottie. I've gotten some of my dresses from here along with shoes. Plus the decor is on point. It's everything girly, classy, and chic rolled into one.
1	My shopping experience was great minus the fact that they sold me a shoe with a hole in it. No returns, perfect but at least exchange the shoe with a hole. The manager was rude and made no effort to make me happy. She also accused me of wearing the shoe...yes I did in my house when I noticed the hole. I tried to exchange (not return)the shoe the following day. Not shopping here again. I'm all about customer service and yours was shitty.
4	I literally love this place so much so so much. They have some of the cutest fashions for the most affordable prices. The staff is very friendly and incredibly accommodating. If you're looking for something they no longer have in stock they have no problem calling around to their other stores to see if they have that product. I highly recommend the store to anyone just moving to Vegas in on an affordable budget.
