5	I loved my recent visit to Cowboy Trail Farms. You'd never never know there was a high-yield organic farm behind those ranch homes.  You can join their CSA and pick up fresh produce weekly on site, or you can pick up your produce at one of their drop-off locations. I got varieties of of cucumbers I've never heard of, beautiful cherry tomatoes, some summer squash varieties, and beautiful sweet corn. Hoop houses allow year-round crops. Prices are reasonable for organic produce (compared to farmers' markets  like Tivoli Village!) and the people who run the place obviously love what they do and are very knowledgeable. I look forward to visiting again.
5	Great place to visit when you want to see a real Organic Farm! Marilyn is a real Gem and she surly knows her stuff, and makes you feel welcomed. A great place for children to Learn about how organic foods are grown and explore about the large acreage, that has wonders inside those hoop houses as well. She has GREAT ORGANIC MEATS as well as EGGS, and her shop is clean.... spend a Saturday morning at Cowboy Trails Farms....
5	The weekly CSA's are consistently great.  I can't get over how much is included and the variety of fresh organic produce in each weeks bag.  The micro greens are especially tasty and I appreciate the printed recipes that Marilyn tucks in the bag.  I also now buy all my free range eggs and organic beef at Cowboy Trail Farm on my weekly Saturday morning visits.  Do go out and explore this lovely oasis in the Vegas desert and be sure to give Charlie the cattle dawg a scratch behind the ear.
