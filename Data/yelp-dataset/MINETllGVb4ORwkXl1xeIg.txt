3	They used to be better here but all the good employees seem to never stay somewhere too long these days! now days, the staff is ok, not great and they have all kinds of signs in their drive thru that are written by an angry child. "please keep transactions less than 5 and make sure your transaction is ready!!!" or something like that!It's annoying when you go inside and need a notary or something and they try to sell you an auto loan or ask to refi your house.
4	Convenient location right next to the 24 Hour gym and Zipps sports grill. Typical, consistent service. They hold my money so that's good.
5	I have accounts at both Chase and Wells Fargo.  Chase is BY FAR the superior of the two.  The employees at this location are extremely friendly.  Many know us by name, and several have said hi when running into us in the grocery store, church, etc.  I appreciate their friendliness and great customer service and will bank here for a long time to come.
