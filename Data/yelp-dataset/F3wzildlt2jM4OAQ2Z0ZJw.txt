5	I'm always greeted with a warm smile, no matter who's hosting that day.  I like Street's consistent menu, no matter which location I choose, and I really enjoy their pizza...
5	Eating in is a decent experience, but for delivery, I have yet to meet their match.  When I order delivery I always get a 16" chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top, and for the last 6 years I have received it in 30 minutes or less all but 2 times.  Its always tasty, fresh, and is my preeminent food for delivery, ever, period.
3	Had the pizza and its ok for something quick.  They do have pretty good lunch specials and the service was good.
5	I'm not a huge pizza fanatic, but this location was my go to on pizza nights. I was sad to drive by and see they were replaced by a sub shop! :-(
