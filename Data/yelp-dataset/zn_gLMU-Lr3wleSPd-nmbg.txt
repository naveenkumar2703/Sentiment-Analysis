3	CHOP CHOPis a Panda type Chinese fast food, cafeteria style place. It seemed like the same types of food. Same type of plates/bowls/combos etc. It might be the same people working, you know "we all look the same" I had Chop Chop kids meal, (saving $ and fat) it was like a grilled chicken breast with Chinese BBQ sauce on it. It came with fried rice, spring roll and a drink. $5.40 with an "adult" sized drink. There was plenty of food for a lunch and it was good. I have nothing funny or cool to say about Chop Chop. It is what it is.
5	I really love this place. The food is really good and priced very well. I know its cool to like Panda but when you try this place you will completely forget about eating somewhere else just cause its cool. I have gone to Chop Chop many many times and have never left unhappy. Also anyone I have brought to this place has loved it. Give it a try and you will be a Chop Chop fan.
