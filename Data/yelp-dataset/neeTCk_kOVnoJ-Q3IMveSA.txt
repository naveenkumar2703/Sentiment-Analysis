5	Anna is amazing! She has been doing my hair for years and I have never once had a complaint!! She definitely knows what she's doing. Anything you can imagine your hair looking like she can do it!! Such amazing hair stylist!! I will never go anywhere else
5	Anna is great! I recommend her to anyone looking for quality work!
5	This was my first experience using Anna Ware for a haircut. Anna did a fabulous job on my hair! I told her I wanted something low maintenance, pretty much wash and wear, which is exactly what I got (but a little extra effort and it looks great for a night on the town too!). It's so hard to find a stylist that really listens to what you want and what fits in with your lifestyle but Anna is exactly that. I look forward to her taking care of my hair in the future.
5	Anna is very fun and very professional. My wife loves her hair color and I drive many miles across town just for a haircut. 5 stars Anna!
