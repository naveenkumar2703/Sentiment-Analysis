5	a G Spot is a myth.  and Dr Graffenberg was a mad scientist.So its no surprise that I couldn't find the Gelato Spot either.  Shannon spouts, "I love gelato so much, I would bathe in it".  Hmmm, that's interestingI drove in and around the dirt road... and went up and down Scottsdale ... explored the box... looked south of the landing strip at Scottsdale Airpark... manually googled it... orally asked the passerbysRoad several times and I couldn't find it ANYWHEREMaybe I need to do more research.  Perhaps some field research...Or a targeted focus group*** UPDATE  ***Its on Shea Blvd??  No wonder I couldn't find it-I was looking down the wrong road*** UPDATE  ***Thanks Jake P for "Yeah it is on Shea, in the strip mall area east of scottsdale rd near the Harkins Theater and Pita Jungle and such.... "BUT the point of this review was sarcasm.  i.e. g- spot is hard to find*** UPDATE  ***Now I have a girl, "Shannon W", telling me where g-spot is.  She writes, "It's on 74th St. and Shea, in between Coffee Plantation and Pita Jungle."Shannon W:  The point of this review was sarcasm.  i.e. g-spots are hard to find
5	This G spot is far less crowded than the one on Scottsdale Rd. There is also a bigger patio partially because the coffee plantation is right next door. Here are my favorite flavors so far:There are alot by the way...a fruity side and the sinful side.AHEM* Cookies and Creme* Oreo*Nutella* Carmel*Mango*Passion fruit*RaspberryYumm! Great date spot or place to bring an out of towner!
5	Gelato is the new black.  It goes with everything and makes you feel skinnier than regular ice cream.  Which is why I can justify eating it almost every day.  The fruit flavors are even sugar free (or is it fat free?  Whatever) so you can enjoy gelato without the guilt of DQ.My staple favorites are the cookies n cream, snickers (ok so shannon and I go together once in a while), mint chocolate chip, and the oatmeal rasin.  Trust me.  Despite popular belief (and all joking aside) The "G" Spot isnt as hard to find as some people think.  And you'll never want to leave once you get there.
5	Amazing, amazing, amazing. Been there less than 10 times due to living super far away, but would be there every day if I could. Haven't had the fruit flavors, but all the chocolate and nut ones are great. Had real gelato across the walk from Treve Fountain while in Rome... and this might just be better. Only complaint is one time I had a snotty high schooler helping me out.. but whatever. The ice cream makes up for snotty kids.DELISH!!!
5	I spent the summer in Southern Italy (Lecce) where I would finish almost everyday with the evening walk and a scoop of pistachio gelato - if I was feeling like a risk taker, I would include a little hazelnut with my daily one scoop. The Gelato Spot is almost as good as being in Italy - all the same, the gelato is as close to perfection as you'll get here in town.
5	Love it, lots o flavors to choose from and they are all good. Yummy! Places like this makes me miss Phoenix on those hot summer nights.
5	I fell in love with gelato years ago when I spent some time in Europe... now, back in the states, I tend to be more of a fro-yo kind of girl, but I do treat myself to gelato every now and then... and when I do, it's usually at The Gelato Spot.  I tend to go to this location or the one at 32nd Street and Camelback.  Last night, however, I gave into my sweet tooth at the dessert reception at the Herberger Theater Center after seeing Arizona Theatre Company's 'The Clean House.'  The G-spot catered for us and it was fantastic!  I went with the cheesecake and strawberry combo -  Mmmm...  just thinking about the smooth silky sweet flavors makes my mouth water!I'm also a fan of lemon, keylime, mango... and then at the other end of the spectrum, pistachio, hazelnut, baccio - actually, I don't think I've ever encountered a flavor I didn't like!  With other desserts on their menu including cakes, shakes, and pastry creams, there's something that is sure to 'hit the spot' at the G-spot!
5	I wrote an email to the director of quality control. I have pasted the conversation for you all! Hey,I love your gelato and I eat there once a week. It is expensive, do you have any programs like a punch card or something to give loyal customers a reward once in a while or like a free b-day gelato? Most websites have a place you can sign up for news and deals. I didnt see that on your site. I also wanted to say thanks for not using hydrogenated oil, I would reccomend and love if you considered removing it from your cones, or using a vendor that does not add it. It is becoming increasingly taboo. Plus the gelato is for the most part natural so Why stuff it in a cone that has oil banned in the entire state of California and on th ballot to be removed at tons of major citys.  Lindsay, Thanks for contacting us regarding your concerns and praises.  Thank you very much for the kind words.  Please send me your address and I will send you some free coupons for being a loyal customer.  It's funny you brought up having a loyalty card for the gelato spot because this week I put the order in to have a electronic combo card.  It will have both features loyalty and gift card.  It will be similar to a Starbucks card but with more rewards.  It will be at least 1 month before this feature will become active since it interfaces with our Point of sale system it is a complicated process to integrate everything.  Also I did look at the ingredients for our cones and you are right about having partially hydrogenated oils in the mix being taboo these days.  I will look for another alternative to this problem quickly.  I will definitely let you know when I find new product. Unfortunately we do not make the cones from scratch like our gelato so I will have to do some research on possible making our own waffle mix.  Feel free to contact me anytime.  Thanks for hitting the gelato spot.  Thomas PlatoDirector of Quality ControlThe Gelato Spotthomasp@gelatospot.com I love you Gelato Spot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5	The She G-spot has become a regular stop for us lately... it seems we're falling into a routine where every time we eat dinner at Pita Jungle, we stroll over to the G-spot for dessert.  Every now and then I can stay strong and just sample Jared's pick (usually lemon and raspberry), but last night - i felt the need to have my own!  I went with coconut and savored every bite!  It was the perfect creamy sweet treat,. and it had just the right amount of real coconut too... yum!I love G-Spot even more for all of their 'People Love Us on Yelp' stickers in the shop - if you haven't noticed them, you haven't been lately... go check them out!
5	Five stars for The G-Spot.  Last time I was there, the Toasted Almond. OMG mmm.
5	awesome employees with great selection of ice cream. I like the chocolate and vanilla ice cream, it tasted very subtle without over powering the sweet or bland flavor. I was visiting town and wanted to cool down on a 110 degree weather in june. Definitely going back next time!
4	It took me a little while to find it in the shopping center since I got a little turned around. After searching for a good 10 minutes, wandering into a couple other shopping centers, and finally just parking and walking the area, I was able to find it. My hard work paid off, that's for sure.Ice cream / froyo / gelato was pretty much one of the only categories of food I was able to hold down during my bout with food poisoning. And this place definitely hit the spot. So many excellent flavors to select from. So many choices, I didn't know what to get! Had to hover around for a few minutes in order to narrow down my choices. Only thing I didn't really enjoy was that the waffle cone smelled old and kinda tasted stale. Other than that, a great experience.
5	This place is a must after every Pita jungle trip (and those are often!). Just went with the wife and shared an Oatmeal Raisin... yum! Never really tried a flavor I haven't liked so as far as I'm concerned it's all good. The place is always clean, the peeps are always friendly (quick with a sample spoonful :) and it's cooold in there, yay!
5	Woohoo!  Totally awesome!  I'm a huge gelato fan, as I am with most sweets and this place is wonderful for the taste buds.  I went here two years ago when I came to visit and specifically requested that we make a return trip.  I wasn't disappointed.  The price for gelato here is not cheap, but I've come to expect that at all gelato spots.  I had the chocolate caramel brownie and the vanilla bean gelatos.  They were fabulous and so deliciously rich and creamy.  So much better than regular ice cream.  It makes me sad that we don't have one in my town.  However, we've got the North End close by, but I still think the Gelato Spot is better!
5	The Gelato Spot = Creamy goodness, tons of flavors, and less guilt than Cold Stone or DQ.GELATOYou can sample as much as you want top help you decide which one of the amazing flavors you should get- Blood Orange, Nutella, Kiwi Coconut, Fudge Carmel Brownie, Mint Chip, Amaretto- is your mouth watering yet?AMBIANCEIt has coffee shop/Ice cream palor feel to it. They have regular tables and chair and also very comnfy chairs around a coffee table too. OTHERThey clean their equipment constantly so if you have a peanut allergy (like my daughter does) they will accomodate.
3	I've got to admit it, this G Spot doesn't really hit it for me (pun intended). I dropped by here tonight while killing time before a movie at Shea 14. Maybe the fact that I'm not a huge gelato kinda guy plays into this but this place was just a little over "OK" in my opinion. The gelato wasn't bad by any means, but gelato is always just like softer, doughier ice cream to me. It'd probably be a better overall experience if I was into it.
4	Tried a few flavors, decided on the bacio bianco (a white chocolate hazelnut) and Dave got pineapple.  The pineapple was too sweet for me, but Dave really enjoyed it.  Mine was really good, though too creamy for Dave.  What I liked about mine was that it was creamy but not too rich, because I don't normally like white chocolate.Lots of flavors available, and perfect on a hot day.  Outdoor eating if you want to brave the heat, but paired with the gelato it was great.
5	The Gelato Spot has the best frozen desert in the Valley! This location is conveniently located next to the Pita Jungle and the Harkins Cinema on Shea. Mmm!
4	Really surprised to find a quality gelateria in the middle of a valley, but I did! Great diverse selection of coffee and gelato make it a very welcome stop on the way back from work, or for dessert!
4	--4.3 stars-- from August 26th 2009I thought I couldn't eat any anymore after pita jungle, but man oh man, this place is soooo tasty.  I wanted more after I was done.  highly recommended if you're in the area.
5	best gelato I've tasted !    It's creamy with rich flavors and my mouth feels like it's in heaven every time I eat it. They  offer some of the best  gelato flavors such as Stracciatella, Rum Raisin ,Amarena,Bacio, They  also offer teas and desserts. Staff was very  friendly and very  helpful .. Great  place ...
5	Gabi you are so awesome! G- spot pleasure is exactly what this place exemplifies!Let's start with the basics:1. Creamy deliciousness in every bite!2. Great service!3. Comfortable and relaxing environment!4. Open late!With these and much more, no one can go wrong or get lost in this G-spot experience! I had the chocolate hazel nut, and I can't wait to come back and try what else they have to offer.
5	I requested that they move closer to my apartment. This place is AMAZING. I used to work at an Italian restaurant so I know how gelato is supposed to taste and this place doesn't miss the mark. They have a ton of different flavors. I tried the bubble gum, lemon, and pumpkin pie flavors which were all very tasty but I went with my favorite: mango. I was not disappointed. The fellow behind the counter was actually from Italy and he was a total sweetheart. They make their own waffle cones there too and they were fabulous. They also gave us cups of water because we all know how thirsty ice cream can make you. I am in love and can't wait until I venture out to Scottsdale again so I can return here.
5	Okay Gelato is the best ice cream ever its made fresh every day, they are very welcoming and they have calorie papers and Gelato is the place with the least amount of calories.I love their NY Cheese Cake the best ever and their triple chocolate Carmel fudge brownie if you like chocolate.I would go to Gelato for good and very taste full ice cream.
2	Average gelato. Tastes more like ice cream. Don't go out of your way if you have ever had real gelato.
5	I fought my love for the G-Spot but I give in!! I decided to spoil my family in East Mesa and brought home the largest container and loaded it up with my fav flavor rocher! Tastes exactly like ferrero rocher chocolate! Mmm hazelnut goodness! They need one closer to home!! But for now I def don't mind it being down the road from work!
5	the gelato spot is awesome!!!!!! more than gelato is served here.....they also have sorbet........some of the best sorbet that i have ever tasted in my life!  i had a groupon as we were visiting from illinois.....i loved the banana sorbet.  very unique and flavorful....my husband loved the tiramisu gelato...can't wait to return during our next visit to az...
3	The Gelato is nothing outrageous that calls for a $4 scoop range. The servers are great, the place has indoor and outdoor seating. If your grabbing grub from the pita place next door or getting out from the movies it's worth a visit. But don't come out of your way to visit this joint.
2	Mmmm gelato.  I have mixed feelings about this place- the gelato is good, but not amazing, the prices are pretty steep for what you get, and when I was here recently the girl behind the counter was giving everyone the stink-eye.  Maybe she was just having a bad day, which happens to the best of us, but it was slightly uncomfortable and I was a almost scared to ask for a second sample.  I'll probably still come here after I go to the movies or eat at Pita Jungle next door, but its not something I would go out of my way for.
5	Wonderful selection of gelato and sorbets.  Clean, bright place to enjoy it in, too.
5	We found this place on Yelp! and I am glad we did. While visiting Scottsdale we dropped in and enjoyed the air conditioned parlor. We had the Oatmeal raisin gelato (heavenly) and chocolate chip gelato. It was so creamy and delicious that we stopped in the following night for dessert again! This time having the banana gelato (I'm going bananas for this!), oatmeal (yes, that good) and lemon (super tart). All in all, great except for the young rude kids that hang out at the local theater that were loud and obnoxious. Luckily, the young girl behind the counter had the courtesy of asking them to loiter elsewhere to allow patrons to have a seat! Thank you!
3	ROCHE gelato! thought it would be yummy...well it wasn't bad..but it wasn't super yummy....the Mint Chip gelato was much better. After a long day at the Sea Life Aquarium in Tempe, the shopping mall in Scottsdale and the mediocre dinner at Wildfish Seafood Grille, my bf and I thought we would top off the night by sharing a cup with two flavor scoops of gelato. It hit the sweet spot alright....but not exactly a satisfying one. For some reason the gelato tasted a lot more like regular ice cream....which isn't really what I want..therefore that could be the reason why I wasn't satisfied. But it was a good quick fix for those with a sweet tooth..=P
3	Groupon brought us in for our first try.  A small but hip location, with a fancy display case and raised platform for the servers.  Lots of flavors to choose from made it hard to pick but they were happy to share samples.  Service was fast & friendly.  The gelato was umm-yummy.  A great spot for after-movie treats.  Thanks Groupon for bringing us in.  We'll be back!
2	Let me begin by saying that Gelato Spot is a wonderful place for enjoying a multitude of gelato flavors. It happens to be the best place to get gelato in the valley. However, this review is not focused on their gelato expertise but rather their gelato/mousse CAKE services. I recently celebrated my wedding and did not want a traditional wedding cake. We opted for a combination of a gelato and mousse cake at Gelato Spot. We met with their decorator, Yasmin, whom was very friendly and seemed to produce very beautiful wedding cakes. Once the final layout was approved, we couldn't wait to see the final product. Upon inspection, the cake was almost lopsided and the fondant was not smooth in several areas. Specific design features were left off, in addition to missing specific cake flavors. The overall appearance screamed " rushed." The cake wasn't horrible but barely met the minimum standards of what I deem "clinically acceptable." In the end, everyone enjoyed the cake and had a good time, however for the inflated price and lack of execution, I would not choose Yasmin for my cake needs in the future. Stick with simple gelato and you cant go wrong.
5	Oh my goodness .. AMAZINGLY good tasting ice cream. Not inexpensive, but seriously delicious, you definitely get what you pay for, and the ambiance of the environment is really unusually nice, too.
5	loved it! the chocolate and banana shake was delicious. kid approved too via my three yr old daughter. soooo many flavors will have to stop by soon!
3	3.5 starsPretty good gelato chain restaurant with a decent selection of gelatos at normal prices.
4	I usually order the same thing but this time I had the Samoa Cookie which was delicious along with Snicker's.
2	The only reason we went here is that my favorite place, the Gelato Maker, is closed on Mondays.  This place scores points for the  cute decor but, that is about it.  Their gelato isn't near as good as the Gelato Maker, it is quite pricey and the service is horrid.  Even my teenager nephew made a comment about the girl serving us and said "I don't think she likes her job too much."  There is much better quality for less money at Gelato Maker.
5	Gelato heaven indeed!
4	Gelato Spot's ample seating and abundant selection make it a viable option for escape from deathly Arizona heat.The gelato is on the creamier end of the creamy-icy scale.  Both the Coffee and Cookies & Cream (my favorite dessert flavors) tasted plentifully strong, coexisting wonderfully in a crisp, fresh waffle cone.  The gelato also admirably withstood melting, indicating a high-quality product unexpected at a chain.Would revisit if in the area!
5	When I think of gelato, I automatically think of the Gelato Spot. First spotted them years back on Camelback and I've been a fan ever since. My favorite is the Stracciatella and all others fall into place. Their free Wi-Fi is always on and is an added touch. Let's you just sit and relax and not head for the door.Keep up the good work.
4	***** The service was fantastic, There was a nice warm lady attending the shop and the Gelato was awesome as always!!! ** Yummy Chocolate Caramel Fudge Brownie!! :)
5	When I have been to this location, the customer service has been great, everyone is very friendly and helpful and you can't go wrong with gelato. Tons of flavors to choose from, salted caramel is my new favorite.
5	It's official...I have now been to all 4 Valley Gelato Spot locations and have not been disappointed at any of them!  Talk about consistency...every single one tastes the same and that is delicious!  Great, relaxing atmosphere and a friendly staff.  My dog just can't get enough of the peanut butter...boy, does she love this stuff!  I have to admit I can't either...the Cookies & Cream and Pineapple are incredible as well!
5	Love this place.  Went with my family of four - each of us had a different flavor!  All were exceptional!  Will definitely be back - even if it is a 20 minute drive from my house!
3	Went here with my aunt who had a groupon. Not the greatest, but the place is nice anc cool and they have a great selection of gelato! id go wtih coconut or salted carmel!
5	the bf and i stopped in for a late lunch with a Groupon. we ordered paninis that took no more than 10 minutes to make and they were SO GOOD! the ingredients were fresh and flavorful. we also sampled a couple flavors of gelato before deciding on raspberry cheesecake & choco/peanut butter. everything we had was amazing and we will be returning to try all the flavors (and some pizza)!
5	This appears to be a must after a Pita Jungle meal. Even though I was stuffed, I knew I needed to stop in. I hardly ever come to places like these and get the first thing I try. Today was the exception. One bite of the Salted Caramel and I was hooked. With a TON of delicious looking and sounding options, this is a place I would frequent weekly if I was in the area.
5	When "___" created the heaven and the earth, Gelato Spot was the reward!  It is by far the most amazing gelato experience outside of Rome Italy! Flavors of the month are a must and sign up for their mobile rewards discount program - they send you a text with a code so you don't have to mortgage the house when you pick 3 flavors! ALWAYS pick 3 flavors!!! The calories in their gelato are nothing compared to store bought ice creams! Better you should NOT buy any ice cream for the house and go to the Gelato Spot once a week!!!! AMAZINGLY AWESOME!
4	I love this place and my twins do too.  They are like the Pavlov dogs, as soon as they are done with their lunch at the restaurant next door, they walk out and immediately scream for ice cream, well gelato.  My little boy is expanding his horizons, he requested a taste of a different flavor and he picked his own flavor the last time we were there.  I guess pretty soon I will have no say in a lot of thing.  Not sure I am cool with that.  I wish they would allow two flavors in the small cup like at my favorite gelato joint.
4	Great gelato, but so expensive...
4	One of our routines after a movie, is to come here for a "le petit dessert".It also works before the movie as well.  LOL.  It all depends if we're doing Reverse HH next door at Pita Jungle.There are a few G Spots in Scottsdale.  This one serves just gelato, or frozen milk as I like to think of it.  The one in Old Town has some great pizza.  Several Yelp'er it seems, have used up their allotment of the word "Amazing' to describe the G Spot.  So I'll add delicious to the lexicon.  We had the Dark Chocolate and Salty Caramel last weekend, after seeing Zero Dark Thirty.Go!  Enjoy!
3	I can't say I was blown away or anything. In terms of flavor, nothing beats "That's Amore Gelato" on Pinnacle Peak and Miller roads despite the fact that  I call them thieves for charging so much for their gelato.There is quite a variety of flavors and you can count on paying about $ 4.00 for a small cup for which they allow you to have two flavors. There are quite a few varieties and I had the coffee with rock (spelling). At first taste, I can't say that my taste buds were overwhelmed by the quality of the ingredients. It is truly average hence a three star rating as it's truly not the best gelato I've ever had.
4	Good place to get quality gelato and relax on their patio.
2	SUMMARY: If you love American ice cream, you'll love Gelato Spot.  If you love great authentic gelati, you'll be very disappointed.DETAILS: With all the rave reviews, I was SUPER EXCITED to try Gelato Spot, after having recently spent a month traveling around Italy with my hubby. I'm SUPER SAD to say I was disappointed.I suppose our travels turned us into Gelato snobs; in Italy we made a point to eat gelati *at least* once a day and we immediately began to decipher the "good" vs the "bad" and - for fun - rated them accordingly. In comparison, the gelati at Gelato Spot is towards the bottom of the Italian gelati totem pole. At the "G Spot" the entire middle section was empty so from the slim pickings we selected:*Pistachio (a favorite in Italy)*Mango*Coconut*Mint Chocolate ChipDo yourself a favor and skip the mango. The others were sickeningly sweet and thick and more akin to rich American ice cream, which - by the way - you can buy an entire tub for the cost of a large "gelato".
2	Shady business practices. They have been marketing the 'chef flavors' like crazy. Then they push the group-on which is not valid for pizza and food (which it states). HOWEVER, the group-on is NOT valid for the "Chef Flavors" either. Plus, when I asked about the cost I was told they were the same, but when I went to check out, they were not (this is also when I was told that the group-on was not valid). After all this, the only thing I was told was  "well it's for charity" (what percent?) and then after a long pause, "we could dump it back in and you could select a non-chef flavor." The entire reason I purchased the group-on in the first place. I was very unhappy and had groceries in 110 degree car. So I just paid for it. 16.08!! for a pint of ice cream. Maybe if you come from old Scottsdale money this is not big deal and Gelato Spot could be playing Robin Hood. 16.08!! The chef flavor I choose was good, but a splurge on quality and calories for me is paying $5 for Talenti (awesome) at Sprouts. Point of the story. The group-on would make the price reasonable if you could actually use it. Sucks too. I am a huge wood fired pizza fan when it is done right. Yet there shady business practices makes me never want to go back.
4	Always quick service, always delicious. Just FYI to management, please post your 'seasonal hours' online. It stinks to drive all the way out there to find the bad news in someone else's handwriting.
