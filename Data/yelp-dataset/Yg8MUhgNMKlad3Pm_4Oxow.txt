1	I live across the street and don't have a car so don't have many choices in where to eat out if and when we do. I will choose anything over Panda again! The last two times my husband went there for me when I was having a craving the food had been sitting for a while cause it was cold and mushy... Not to mention I got food poisoning just 2 weeks ago from there!!!! GO ANY PLACE ELSE!!!!!!!!!
4	Don't know why you guys gave such bad reviews. Panda Express at this location is one of the best I've eaten so far.
