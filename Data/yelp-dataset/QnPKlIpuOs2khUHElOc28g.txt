5	Besides the usual convenience store gas station Jr's is a great lil shop to stop by and purchase authentic Native American arts and crafts for that quick purchase. Although limited because they sell as fast as they are delivered, the selection is sweet. Great place to pick up the Navajo Nation news and Tanka Bar.
5	Two friends and I decided to drive from Phoenix, AZ to Davis, IL together.  It was Ron's idea to get on the road by 5:00 am to try to beat the heat.  We found this gas station using the GasBuddy app on my friend's phone on our way out of town.The gas was inexpensive and the station was very conveniently located right on the route we needed to take to make the first leg of the trip to Albuquerque, NM.  We were in and out quickly, which was kind of the point, and it was too early in the morning for me to want to take detailed notes, so it'll be a short reviewWant cheap gas?  Fill up here!
5	Best gas prices around!As far as the convenience store goes, they have a large selection of products and the staff is SUPER friendly.
5	Great place for cigarettes. I drove ALL over Phoenix to find Lucky Strikes and could not find them! But Jr's definitely had them! Very friendly staff
5	Great service, clean restrooms, decent prices and economically priced gas. Will definitely stop by here on my way back home.
