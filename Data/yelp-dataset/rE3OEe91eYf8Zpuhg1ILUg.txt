3	This GNC is inside the Boulevard Mall.  It's solid, it has all that you would want from a vitamin store.  Of course a lot of what they carry are GNC brands but GNC has been around for a long while and it does what it does very well.  I can't really give it more stars but I will definately be back.
3	I was not in there very long because I knew exactly what I wanted and as soon as I told the fella working he went straight to it, told me that it was buy one get one half off and I was sold. So I am not the happy owner of some peppermint oil, which smells amazing when used for aromatherapy type stuff if that is your thing. The store seemed well stocked though and it is the one inside the Boulevard Mall. It is the only one close to me really. The next closest is in Fashion Show and that probably would have taken me forever to get in and out of, so this one was the way to go!
3	The selection here is decent for a GNC. However, they do not carry my favorite pre workout ACG3.On my recent visit I purchased the blueberry pomegranate Neon pre workout and two different protein bars. The two employees I spoke with said they had heard great things about the taste of the Neon pre workout. After trying it, it tasted nothing like blueberry or pomegranate. It tasted more like cough medicine. Additionally, one of the protein bars I purchased was stale. I will only be back if I desperately need a pre workout, I still prefer ordering supplements online even though you normally cannot return them.
