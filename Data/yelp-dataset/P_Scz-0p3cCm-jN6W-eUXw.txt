1	UNPROFESSIONAL/RUDE. Their staff was not friendly at all. Very hard to get through on the phones and when you do staff is very rude. After busy signal for many times when I did get through they put me on hold for which seemed like forever. I hung up and called back and had to go through the busy signals about 5 times again before getting through. Then when you do get through you have to deal with a very nasty staff. Maybe over worked...? The office manager Peggy is the worst. They need some phone help so the staff isn't so stressed out. Hopefully that will help.
5	When I spotted a rapidly changing mole it freaked me out.  Getting a fast appointment with a top dermatologist can be tough....but his team had me scheduled within 3 days and could not have been nicer. Dr.Powers is wonderful, has a calm, kind and friendly manner and his team is the same. I'm a nervous patient and they were terrific. Highly recommend.---Sue B, Scottsdale
1	I"M SURPRISED THE REVIEWER BEFORE ME got in so fast.The receptionist called to confirm my appt tomorrow but I am going on vacation and didn't make it for the day I leave! the scheduler was so rude and nothing was available until July! I have an weird  spot on my scalp and Quite worried so guess how much fun I've had trying to see someone??? 2 friends recommended powers but will not be returning.
5	This is the only doctor's office I've ever been to where you get taken on time, Dr. Powers is the nicest man, and he has the best office support staff. I'm sorry to see the 2 bad reviews, I've been going there for probably 20 years and I never had a bad experience.
