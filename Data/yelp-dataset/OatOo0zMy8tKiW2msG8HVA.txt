4	Not a whole lot to say just YUM!My co-worker ordered some for work and i missed out because i was busy... he had promised me some earlier but couldnt save anythe next day we went together and he ordered a large. he had the girl split it into 2 boxes so i could take some home. it took a bit of a wait but i was very impressed, the garlic bread was awesome too very softhours later the pizza was still good cold! im def going back to get the full experience for myself but their food alone has earned them more business
3	Our food arrived late and was burned. We had to call in twice to have our orders corrected without much avail. The delivery drivers were really nice but the people on the phone weren't very helpful. A lot of the items available on the menu of the Tropicana location were not available at this one. We couldn't get their hot fries or two different varieties of pizza. We settled for a custom pizza that wasn't nearly as exciting as we had hoped & two calzones that ended up being burnt. I've had excellent pizza from the Tropicana location, but it's still a bit expensive. I'm still giving them 3 stars because the pizza was above mediocre, delivery people were exceptionally nice and willing to bring back re-made orders and I know that the company is capable of creating delicious pizza. I'm hoping this was just an off night...
4	i wouldn't describe with a style because it is different. It's a little thicker than New York stlye and has a doughy textureI always go with the mushroom topping. They are sauted mushrooms and just add the perfect taste to the pizza. Metro has a calander where they have different specials for different occasions just about every day. I always order during football season because on Sundays they offer buy one get one with up to three toppings on each. It helps because they are a bit pricy.
