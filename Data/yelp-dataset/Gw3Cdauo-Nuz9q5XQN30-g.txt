5	Great price and great service.  I has a bad experience with another florist in Casa Grande and ended up at Greens & Things.  They charged me $75 less than the other florist  was going to charge and made the exact arrangement I wanted.  I couldn't be happier and I will use this florist whenever I need flowers in Casa Grande.
5	Still 5 stars and still the best florist in CG. They make it so easy to order flowers and don't charge a fortune either.
1	I ordered an arrangement for a celebration of life and they never delivered and didn't call to warn me. Didn't receive a call until the next day. Unprofessional and unreliable!
1	I send flowers every week and I wanted to make sure this flower shop could accommodate.  I called the store to speak with the manager and he was out to lunch. I was told by the girl working there that he would call me back when he returned.  He never returned my call. A couple days later I sent an email and no response.If this is what they call customer service,  they are not worth my money.
4	We had a slight mishap with the flowers on Valentines Day. My wife received the flowers late. The follow up the next day was exceptional. The owner was very apologetic and refunded us the money as the flowers had arrived so late on Valentines Day. The service despite being average on Valentines Day was exceptional the next day. Also the flowers were spectacular. I would definitely recommend this business. It is nice to have a business owner who accepts responsibilty for mistakes and takes appropriate measures to correct them.
