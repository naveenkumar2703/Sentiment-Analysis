4	Again a good place tot ake kids.It has seating,most of are upstairs.My table wasnt cleared when i got to it , but someone did take it away.the staff looked welcoming and smiley.
3	A great place for some food.yes most of its not helthy but its good.Its not to pricey and you have a big selection to choose from on the menu.This isnt far off from princess street,so great after some shopping.The staff were kind and approachable.
4	Greasy, incompetent staff? Yes.Greasy incompetent food, that is nevertheless strangely addictive? YesNoisy, loud and full of 14 year old glue sniffers? YesIt annoys me how people lie when they say they hate McDonalds and would never eat there. They do. Everyone does, and everyone secretly loves it. They're not the biggest fast food company in the world just by chance.
3	I am going to put my hand up and say I like McDonalds. As much as people claim to hate it, it gets the job done and it's made a pretty good go at doing so. Recently refurbished, this McDonalds if a-ok. But! What gets my goat about McDonalds is that at 2am on a Friday/Saturday night they entice you in by being the only food outlet open for miles. Well, what feels like miles when your drunk and feet hurt. So you go in and drunkenly order a pile of munch, then realise that when they are open late they bump the prices up by a fair whack. The cost of your post night out munch ends up costing more than your night out did in the first place!Props for being open late over the weekend though.
1	What can I say, I have loved McDonal's up untill now... I ordered a chicken Mayo meal which is normally lovely from McDonald's but not this time.. The bun was hard and crispy and the chicken was like a brick, wouldent even say it was edible, big let down and its fair to say that I am out off McDonal's for good now. Another thing is the hygiene is not as clean as it should be, tables rarely get cleaned.
