5	We came home to find a huge leak in the ceilings of our two story home. I was extremely stressed out and called my plumber who then refered me to Master of Disaster Restoration. The gentleman came out right away and walked me through my options. I chose to file an insurance claim because the damage was so extensive. Master of Disaster Restoration helped walk me through the claims process. They were very thorough and explained all the moisture readings and equipment they were using and I am very thankful to them for turning a bad situation into a positive experience.
3	There was a leak coming from the attic. Chris M from Master of Disaster went above and beyond.  He did the job that the plumber should have done. He came out around 8 pm, checked the situation and when I explained what I thought, he listened. He crawled in the attic, came down and manually regenerated the water softener. Down came the water. Chris showed up on time, was polite and professional, and went above and beyond. He is an asset to this company.However...when the next plumber came out he wanted to charge me SEVERAL hundred dollars to run a hose (less than 5 ft) from the water softener to the water waste line. REALLY??? I AM WOMAN BUT I AM FAR FROM BEING DUMB! Way over inflated pricing.Did the job myself for less than $10.00. I gave a 3 (would've been less) only because Chris was such a gem.
5	Master of Disaster service man Chris M. was excellent!  He is very thorough, great listening skills & excellent communicator in explaining problems. We highly recommend him!  Thank you for your quality service Chris - We greatly appreciate it!M & M Bruner
