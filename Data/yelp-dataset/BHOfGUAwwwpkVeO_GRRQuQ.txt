2	Beats getting sodomized.Make sure to check their webpage to get an idea of wait times.
4	I've been here twice in the past few years and have never had any issues. In fact, today's visit must have been the fastest emissions test in the history of emissions testing. From the moment I received my ticket to the moment I drove away, all of maybe five minutes had passed. Now THAT is awesome.As Brett mentioned, you can check the website for wait times, which is cool if you need to plan ahead. I went in the middle of the day on a weekday, which might be the best time to go.My one complaint is that I had to pay in cash. I'm very lucky I remembered to bring the right amount, because otherwise I would have made the 15 minute drive for nothing! This is apparently an ongoing issue, so bring the appropriate cash just in case their card reader is still broken.
3	It's vehicle emissions.  They all seem to use basically the same system, so it takes about the same amount of time no matter where you go.  The only real variable is how busy they are.  If it's 5-10 minutes per car, as I would estimate, you can get an idea how long you'll be waiting by how far back in line you are.  I've had to wait here for half an hour or more, and sometimes as little as 5 minutes.  This visit was 5 minutes.The crew was pleasant, efficient, and got me out reasonably quickly.  Apparently they now take credit (this is new to me), but probably a good idea to have cash in case there is a problem with the credit card.
5	I went there this morning and got my emissions test done pretty fast.  The customer service was excellent.  Will go back again.
5	Fast and easy.  The way it should be.
