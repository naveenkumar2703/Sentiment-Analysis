5	Mamafit offers a fantastic bootcamp style workout that's friendly & "doable" for ALL moms!  I love exercising outdoors, using the elements (hills, stairs, basketball courts), and socializing with other moms.  Jennifer and Sarah are highly knowledgeable instructors and will help you achieve your fitness goals.  What a win-win alternative for moms & their kiddos!
5	MamaFit is GREAT!  I have been going for three months, and it has helped me get back in shape after having my daughter.  I love the chance to be outside, get a great workout, and chat with other moms...all while not having to worry about childcare.  My daughter is five months old, so she rides along in the stroller as we make our way around the park doing various exercises.  I am challenged by the workouts, which include everything from jumping jacks to sprints to hills/stairs to balance and core strengthening.  The exercises are creative and fun.  I can't say enough good things about MamaFit.  I am so glad I discovered it!
5	Jen comes to my daughters school to do Yoga.  She is a really positive person and engages with the kids.  I hear that she is tougher on the moms to make sure they reach their goals. I can't wait for my hip to heal so I can take her classes.
