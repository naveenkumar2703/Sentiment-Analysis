5	2 PACKS OF SMOKES FOR 5$ / VERY CHEAP CARTONS UNDER 30 $!    NW Corner 7th st-Cavecreek rd-Dunlap I don't work for this smoke shop.  I am a customer.  I was SO impressed with 7th Street Smoke Shop's prices of tobacco and supplies that I felt compelled to spread the word and help grow this great business.  The staff is wonderful!  They are friendly, respectful, and strive to make EVERY customer a HAPPY customer.  So, come check out 7th Street Smoke Shop at 536 E Dunlap Ave, Suite 3, Phoenix, Az 85020.  They have RYO Filling Stations, Cigars, Tobacco, Hookahs, Pipes, etc.  Their hours are Monday through Saturday 9am to 7pm.  You can give them a call at 602-331-7322.  Thanks for hearing what I have to say about this awesome company.Darrel
4	I have to agree: the staff is friendly, the tobacco always fresh and the prices great. HOWEVER, the shop is small and sometimes feels claustrophobic. Also, i would prefer background music on the TV for the waiting customers than R-rated comedy; what if I had brought my grandson in with me to buy something?? Other than that, I give them four stars; I have been to several other smoke shops in the north/central valley and this one is the best so far. Good luck! Get more machines!
