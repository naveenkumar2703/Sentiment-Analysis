5	These guys are great.  Personable and great with communication - and they came in with an estimate at about 50% of two other quotes.  They were able to do the work needed, without pressuring me to take care of other things that could wait to be done at a later date.  I wll definately re-use for future jobs and will recommend to anyone that wants to hear.
5	I found them on yelp. Ryan called me back right way. He is friendly and professional on the phone. After determining that maybe I should call a plumber and buy a new dryer, he did not even charge me for the time he spent. That is above what I expected. I will be using them in the future.Called them in a couple of weeks for water heater replacement. Ryan was again responsive and fair on the price.
5	Ryan is the best!  We had a fridge go on the fritz, and after reaching out on Facebook I got Ryan's phone number from a property management contact.  He answered the phone right away, took plenty of time on the phone with me and squeezed me into his busy schedule.Once here with his partner Shane, they quickly narrowed down the repair options and presented me with my options.  No hard sell or bs, just my options.  I decided to go for the repair and they returned when promised with the part for a successful repair.I would recommend Ryan to anyone in need of handyman or maintenance services!  ARMS rocks!
5	Yay! I found handymen I can count on. I called these guys after reading their other reviews. Completely professional, smart, kind, and just all around great. They set a time in the not so distant future, arrived exactly on time, and did nothing but work. They cleaned up, even dusting an area where a TV they put up had once sat. I've now got them on my speed dial. And costs are very reasonable. They also did some minor faucet work, which was great; I definitely didn't want to call a plumber unless I had to. No worries about that now.
3	These guys are very personable. The first time I called them it was with a simple electrical job. They fit me into their schedule the same day. Ultimately, they were not able to fix the problem, but rather than make matters worse, they simply stated that they couldn't figure it out and that I should call and electrician, which I did. The electrician fixed the problem in 5 minutes.  That said, I've got an appointment scheduled for another job. This time I couldn't get on their schedule for two weeks. The price they quoted me for this job was a fraction of what other contractors were charging.
