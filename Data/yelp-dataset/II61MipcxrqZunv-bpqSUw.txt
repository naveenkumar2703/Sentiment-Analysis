4	Located in the Orleans Hotel, this classy and colorful dining spot is a refreshing change from the endless buffets that seemingly connect one end of the Vegas Strip with the other. The cuisine is more traditional than nouvelle, with long-time Italian favorites cramming the menu. Among the dozen or so pasta options, penne with chicken, spinach, artichoke hearts, and tomatoes in a Parmesan cream sauce is a real standout. House specialties include eggplant parmesan, veal marsala, peppercorn rib eye steak, and a variety of pizzas in solo or family sizes. Portions are on the large side, and prices are very reasonable.
