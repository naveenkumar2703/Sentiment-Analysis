4	Every time I take the time to look at the weekly mailer I get from Anna's I find mself a great bargain. Being that we've had snow this week & its dropped to the 40's I needed a new comforter & sheet set and Anna's had ALL SIZES complete 9 piece bed in a bag sets for $29.99. I usually get all my linens here. They didn't have a very male selection but they had plenty and I was in & out in under 5 minutes with a California King set for under $30. This location is always well stocked and very friendly & helpful staff.
5	This is my happy place. Everyone here is nice and friendly, and they are always eager to help. I've redecorated my kitchen and gotten some new comforter sets for the bedrooms at some awesome prices. Become a "Fan of Anna's" and get their discount card to save even more with quarterly deals. It was  really hard for me not to laugh when the lady asked me if I was a "Fan of Anna's" and asked for my card. Seriously, try saying it aloud without giggling!Anyway, go to this location. The people here are awesome, and you can find anything you've been looking for in home decor at a great price!
5	I don't know how you can give Anna's a bad review ??? Someone said horrible return policy? They give you 30 days just like anywhere else! I love going here for kitchen and bath towels and usually find myself picking up some cute little decorations too. Super cheap rugs for the kitchen and bath. I bought a down alternative for 40 bucks and it's comfy! Soft and nice. Anna's is great if you're like me and like to save money on the basics! This location IS a little sad compared to summerlin area but the employees are always nice and helpful ladies!
