4	This place is a wonderful break from the chain coffee shops.  They offer a great selection of coffees, gelatos and baked goodies.  I loved the coconut bread.  The atmosphere is so relaxing I really think I could of fell asleep in there.  The owners are super friendly and the shop is also kid friendly once a month they have this guy called super dave come out and play music for the kids.
