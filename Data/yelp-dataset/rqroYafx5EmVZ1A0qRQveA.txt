4	Glad to see we have an organized event here in Vegas. Back in the day, before C&C in Henderson, there used to be an informal "C&C" meet at the Starbucks in Summerlin (Charleston/Town Center) on Sundays which I think started the organized movement for Vegas.It is pretty cool to just walk around, check out the cars, vendors and have breakfast at The Griddle.  You can find just about every car genre out there. If you want to bring your car out, make sure you get there before 8 am to snag a prime spot. Great place to mingle with fellow car enthusiasts.
4	"Vroooom!!"Great turnout this AM! Brought my ride here for the first time today.Loads of cars from all eras. Today there were Camaros, Mustangs, Challengers, Chevelles, GTOs, a 442, Corvettes, Shelbys, an Aston Martin, an Audi R8, Nissans, trucks. The whole shebang.The weather was great, too. Cool and sunny.Everyone was super nice and talkative. There are places to get food and drink(it's located in a strip mall lot) and an emcee plays classic rock. Local car clubs and businesses are there and some have kiosks set up as well.Winter hours are 8-11, summer hours 7-10. Every Saturday, weather permitting. Really cold or windy days doesn't bring many cars.So come on out and just walk around; or show your car, hang out and shoot the breeze.It's always a fun time.
