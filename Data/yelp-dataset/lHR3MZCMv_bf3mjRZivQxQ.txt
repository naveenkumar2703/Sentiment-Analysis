4	Leith Waterworld would probably consider itself to be a child's water-based heaven.  Considering the other offerings in the city in this vein, it is right up there.  Just off the bottom of Leith Walk, it attracts a lot of businesses from families and other groups.For a child entering it for the first time, it would be akin to going into a sweet shop, and being given free rein.  There are flumes, a river run, bubble beds, a wave machine and much more.  The group of children that I went with (part of my volunteer work with a children's charity) had great time here.  They were going backwards and forwards like they were on some illegal substance, and for them, the time passed quickly.  For me, sat on the side keeping an overall eye on things, it felt like being sat in a sauna.  That, however, is to be expected.I would agree with Alice's review, in that with the wave machine and amount of children, it's not really aimed at the serious swimmer.  So if you want to do lengths, it's probably better looking elsewhere, like the Wester Hailes Education Centre for example.
