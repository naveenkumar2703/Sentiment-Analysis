4	Easy to get to...Very knowledgable staff...'Wee taste of something?'
4	Not a bad little wine shop at all. I have walked past this place lots of times and still I had not stopped in. So today the god of wine Dionysus must have struck me because I had the worst hankering for a nice bottle of Syrah. I went on in and had a look around. The place is a good size and had a massive selection as well as good prices.  The lady up front asked me if I needed any help, I politely told her I was just browsing and continued to walk around the store. I was throughly impressed. There was a good selection based on different countries like France, Italy, act. I usually drink my Italian wine, got to stick to my roots and keep it real ;) but I saw a good priced bottle of French Syrah. Its one of the best Syrah I have ever had. I let it breath for about 30mins before dinner  and then had it  with some chocolate! So if your looking for a good bottle of wine or whiskey or other spirit and not at a bad price head on down here. They also do wine tastings ( not sure when) so you can try their goodies.  So check this place out even if its just to browse , as I will be back for another bottle of the French Syrah!
