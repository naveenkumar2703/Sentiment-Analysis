4	This place is hidden in a strip mall.  It is tiny and blink you will miss it.  It is clean, the staff is super friendly, and love their ice cream.
5	Took my family here a week ago and I was amazed by how busy it was. I was afraid that we were going to have a long wait but we were in and out in minutes. Great employees too! The girls were super smiley and laughing. It made us all feel good. We will be back!
5	This is the only place I can find my favorite ice cream. I've been coming here for years and I've never once had a problem with this place. I've cream really brings out the kid in us so I would recommend the clown cone, it's really cute and everybody loves it.
