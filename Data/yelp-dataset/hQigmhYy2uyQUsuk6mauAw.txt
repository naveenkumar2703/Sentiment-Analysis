2	The food is ok, and the atmosphere is ok, and the prices are a little too high for the amount of food.  There is nothing spectacular about this place.  It is a solid, not great, but it is always good.  I never had a great meal, but I never had a bad one.One thing really irked me.  The menu said that the Cannelloni is stuffed with chicken, then I was told after I ordered that it is stuffed with beef.  I was very unhappy. Change the menu!
4	This is a great place for lunch.  My colleagues and I eat lunch there once a month.The meatball sub sandwich and cheese ravioli are my personal favorites.  I highly recommend this place for a quick bite to eat for lunch.  I have not dined here for dinner, so I have no opinion on it.
4	My friend who works in Vegas sometimes recommended Capozzolli's. She was told Tom Jones sometimes closes down this place at night. We were there earlier one evening. I had something called scungili salad. Scungili is conch, which people from the East Coast might recognize. I had never had it and it was absolutely delicious. I get the impression you need to know what to order here though, because the pizza was nothing to write home about and most of the Italian dishes looked like Italian American gut bomb food. Nice atmosphere, very relaxed local place to go to get away from the strip craziness.
5	AWESOME.  I travel all the way from Ohio to have Capozzoli's pizza.  During the holidays they have spumoni ice cream pie with a butter crust.  The pasta is wonderful.  Oh man, "it don't get better than that".   Great place.  can't wait to visit again!!!!!
