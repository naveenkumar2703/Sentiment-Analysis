5	I think this is one of the best places to go for everything paintball, and even airsoft! I airsoft myself, and bought an airsoft gun from here. They have all the best paintball and airsoft guns here. The best quality guns for people who are a bit more serious about the sport. This isn't your cheap Wal-Mart guns here.The employees are also great, and extremely helpful. They will answer any question, and even help you out if you are new at the sport. For the best in gear and supplies for Paintball & Airsoft go here!
5	My son just bought his first paintball gun, hopper, mask, etc from these guys.  Their prices are the same as online, so why not establish a relationship with a store where you will need to go to get stuff serviced.The team here is very patient and has amazing knowledge.  They really know their stuff and take the time to walk you through everyting.The store is clean and well organized.  This will be our go to spot for all paintball.
4	First of a all I would like to say I live about 45 min away.  The owner is laidback and a really honest guy.  He fixed my sons gun while I waited and charged me $8. I was quoted $20+ at another shop. I'm sure it was not anything big but I know nothing about paintball or paintball guns so honesty is greatly appreciated.
5	APD is not only the best paintball shop in Arizona but one of the best anywhere in the southwest/west coast. Matt and Jon are the best guys around, super friendly, incredibly knowledgeable and the prices are always fair. The fact that they have been here for nearly 12 years says it all - no matter where you are in the valley this place is worth traveling for.
