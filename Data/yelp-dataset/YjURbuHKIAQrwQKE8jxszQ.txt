5	Woo Hoo!  Little Caesars opens in Fountain Hills!  Yummy pizza.
3	Not bad. Not the best but the price is low.
5	The ONLY place I buy pizza in Fountain Hills!HOT-n-READY $5.00 pizza or hot wings...
1	Little Caesars:  "WAIT, IT'S NOT READY!"  I don't why this particular location NEVER has pizzas ready.  That's the whole point of going to Little Caesars, right?  You go in, give them $5 and walk right back out with a pizza.  It's really not worth waiting for, in my opinion.
4	Pizza is Always Hot and ready never need to wait! Taste good for the price of $5 pies
