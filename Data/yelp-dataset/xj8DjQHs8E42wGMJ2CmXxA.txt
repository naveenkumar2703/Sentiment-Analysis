5	My boyfriend had to have emergency oral surgery and ended up in Ingersoll's office. Not only was he able to get my boyfriend in quickly, he was professional and put my boyfriend who has an intense fear of needles at ease. I would definitely recommend him to friends and family.
5	Dr Ingersoll is fantastic! My daughter had an emergency 3 weeks post surgery, & needed to be seen on a Friday afternoon. Dr stayed late to see her & make sure she was taken care of. EXCELLENT patient care here! Would recommend him to anyone.
5	This doctor and his staff rocks! I have severe dentist anxiety and they did everything to make my experience anxiety free and comfortable! Thank you to Dr. Ingersoll and your amazing staff! :)
