4	2.5 stars for the fairly average Sushi, with an Extra Star for the staff  that was very friendly on our visit.   The Sushi Chefs were obviously having a lot of fun and enjoying what they were doing.  You can opt for either ordering rolls a'la carte or go for the All You Can eat option depending on just how many rolls you can eat.AYCE is about $25 and the average price for their rolls is about $9, so if you can eat more than three whole rolls, make sure to go for the all you can eat option. My current favorite here and will probably be my favorite for a while is the Volcano which is Salmon wrapped cream cheese with scallop topping set ablaze with cooking wine while it's transported to your table, so you have a mouth watering inferno sizzling away in front of you and you have to wait for the fire to go out, because if you try to grab one of those yummy sizzling morsels and just shove it in your mouth and try to chew it while it's on fire it FREAKING hurts! especially when you try to cool it down with HOT tea Arrrggghhhh!....The Pain!!!Oh wha ... wait... sorry, I'm rambling.... that didn't really happen ... no not to me, no really... not me.So yeah, 3.5 stars ... I gotta go.
3	I give this place 3.5 stars.  I live very close by, and opt to go here or even order out.  Good sushi -- haven't had a bad experience here yet.  The staff is very friendly.My favorite dishes here are:The Volcano Roll, which is a baked california roll topped with scallops and mayo and rolled up in salmon,The Tuna Karai Sashimi, which is an awesome Japanese version of Hawaiian poke,and the Johnny Roll, a deliciously light shrimp tempura wrapped in cucumber.Besides the all you can eat they also have bento boxes available.  Overall a great place to eat sushi on the northwest side. :)
1	God. Please don't eat here if you hold food in the highest regard.  This place not only screwed up tempura, but they have mediocre sushi and for higher prices than it's worth.In my entire existence, I never saw beer battered tempura until I decided to stop by this place.  Not only was it the worst tempura ever, it was greasy, mostly batter, and flavorless.  Someone needs to teach the Mexican guy in the back (yes, he was, I heard him talk and he came out a few times) how to cook real Japanese food.Their curry was boxed Japanese brown curry.  I could buy that at the Asian market for 2 bucks, and they charged us 12.  I won't even mention the sushi because it was flash frozen fish, thawed, and served.  I believe that's a sin to serve frozen fish for sushi.  I've seen off strip places serve real fish, fresh ones, and to serve all-you-can-eat frozen fish is a disgrace.Don't go here. EVER.
2	I've been here many times and have had minimal issues, but lately it's gotten much worse.  #1 They are the only place in the city that does it old style and you have to order by paper by checking off what you want. Instead of just asking the sushi chef#2 They always only have 2 sushi chefs working at a time and if they get even 5 customers, the 2 chefs can't keep up and when I DO finally get my order, they give me almost everything at once. WHY? Give me part of my order, so I don't wait forever. #3 They don't make half rolls#4  I wanted a roll on the menu made into a hand roll and he wouldn't do it for me (and yes it was very easy to do if he wanted to)#5, They don't carry my favorite item Natto (fermented soybean)#6 One time they wouldn't serve me uni (sea urchin)  and I saw him with the whole container and I complained to the manager and she said it probably wasn't fresh (I think he just didn't want to serve it)  and now I find out they only serve it on Friday and Saturday because that's when they get a good quality.  (My other favorite place SUSHI MON, has it everyday and always has a good quality) #7 I filled up my stamp card and they wouldn't let me use it on the same night and told me I had to come back and use it on the next visit. (It didn't make sense and I was pissed because I didn't expect to pay that night) AND they don't include my drink (iced green tea) like SUSHI MON AND HIKARI SUSHI. #8 So I come back 4 days later use my free meal and my bill should've been about $3 due to the drink, and it was over $6 because she charged me the tax for the full all you can eat meal EVEN THOUGH IT WAS FREE!!  I said how can you charge me tax on a free meal and she said I come there all the time and I should know this.Even though this place has some menu items that are different and not offered at my other 2 places that I REALLY enjoy , it's not enough to keep me coming back. I'm tired of the excuses, and the little things they are trying to get away with and not really caring about the customer.  It's their loss too, because I spend a LOT of money on going out to all you can eat sushi, on avg 3 times a week. I guess my business will continue to goto Sushi Mon and Hikari sushi. Hikari is the only place I've ever known to offer sashimi as part of the all you can eat.  It's a great deal.
4	I don't feel the hate for this place, they're a little AYCE sushi joint with fast-serving chefs even with a few other couples in the joint.  They had an HDTV with the World Cup on live, and their waitress never let our drinks go empty.  Their rolls are seriously delicious for Las Vegas' sushi shipping issues/AYCE quality!  They were very prompt in service, even when we ordered all over the menu and ran them out of eel.   We left stuffed and feeling the $25 price apiece was fair.Glad there's a decent sushi place in Summerlin without having to go to Red Rock's Hachi.
4	I found the service here quiet good. They kept refilling my drink. I ended up with 4 rolls in front of me at one point he was making them faster then I could eat them. So over all my experience went well. I would go again.
4	Friendly staff, great service, pretty good sushi, and they have all you can eat! My boyfriend and I have been going here for a while since it's near our house. Although it's not the same as Kai sushi and Brians Beach (my two fav sushi joints but located SW of Vegas), Yoko Hama Sushi is not that bad. They offer happy hour from 2pm to 4pm and 9pm to 12am. The all you can eat happy hour is $17.99 and $19.99 (not bad at all). For regular price all you can eat it is $25.95 for dinner and I think $23.95 for lunch. The service is great because since we go here a lot the lady always knows what we want to drink which is iced green tea and she never leaves it empty. If you sit at the bar the chiefs are really nice, they always make sure everything is okay. Must tries: Screaming orgasm (by far my favorite, you will not be disappointed) Tako (if you like octopus) Yellowtail (delicious) Surf Clam (Mmmm yummy) Tuna kari (a kick for your mouth) Baked Mussels (fantabulous)Tempura green tea ice cream (what a great way to end you delicious meal)
2	Since I mentioned this place in my Yama Sushi review, I figured I better make good on that promise and provide the good, the average and the "WTH??"  (http://www.yelp.com/biz/yama-sushi-las-vegas)**the food** The food was... well.. Average. There wasn't anything stand out. The Agedashi tofu was really good, but you go there for sushi, not tofu. The fish seemed fresh enough, but teetering towards the edge of "uhoh", and I just wish it was more memorable. We just went a week ago and I honestly couldn't name a single roll on the menu.**The AYCE rules** I know that all AYCE sushi joints have rules, but this place had more rules than rolls. They had the usual "waste not want not" rule, but it also extended to rice too. Plus they had a time limit and all the good items, like Green Mussels and Mochi, were all One per person. Sadness- it made my tummy cry... **The service** lol, perhaps the only saving point was the Korean chef who spent most of the night cracking of the wise. The two waitresses spent the whole evening chatting in the corner and acted like you were inconveniencing them by asking for anything. Also, WOW, you should have seen the look of sheer disgust on her face when I asked for the obligatory post-dinner mochi. Yeah, I know I have a big bum and hips, it goes with the territory of being Sicilian, but don't look at me like I am trying to eat your child's arm when I ask for some mochi.. Seriously, it really made me feel like a schmuck...**Over all** We only went their initially because it is close to home, work and our schools, and that will be the only time we go. The price was fairly high for the food and service, I paid more there than at any other AYCE sushi joint, ever.. and that was before the tip..
5	I love this place already it's close to my house and very convenient.It was my first time coming; i brought my sister and my daughter we wanted a quick place to eat.Which my sister and I can never say no to AYCE* SUSHI. It's the usual price for all you can eat sushi like any restaurant. Very kid friendly i love the owner!My daughter loved the seaweed salad very fresh! A lot of sushi choices and the staff was very nice. Our cups were never empty :). Plus the dessert was my favorite part. They had tempura ice cream in different flavors.Which is my all time favorite is green tea! Plus we got our picture taken and posted inside the restaurant.You can tell they really appreciate their customers. I will most def. be there again!!
1	The service I got here was terrible. I went to this all u can eat sushi cause It has good reviews but I was wrong... The waitress was rude didnt explain the menu and not everything is on it. The sushi chef had no clue what he was doing and couldnt give us suggestions. When the waitress stated not everything is on the menu so ask the chef...
2	My wife and I accidentally stumbled upon this place when going to see a movie one afternoon. We love sushi, saw the word sushi, and decided to head in and we were not disappointed. The atmosphere was nice. The sushi chefs constantly engaged us in humorous and witty conversation. The fish was fresh and very tasty. We did the 25 dollar all you can eat and it was very much worth it. (EDIT)I am changing the end of my original review. This is because the last three times we have gone in the quality has dropped quite a bit. The rice is hard and does not taste right. Also the quality of fish has suffered as well. On a piece of yellowtail sushi the scales were still on it. And the salmon and smoked salmon sushi is not good at all. The same people are still there but the quality has dropped significantly. I am dropping this to a 2 star and do not plan on dining here ever again.
3	The best place about this sushi place is that it's near my house and the gym, so it's convenient. Other than that, it's pretty normal. I thought the service was fine, the prices were fine, the food was fine. It's not one of those places that I would go to impress a girl, nor is it a dive. I just go there because it's easy and quick. And it's close to the Best Buy, too.Also, you should know that the rolls SEEMED small here. I don't know if that's because I was extra hungry or my date had a ravenous appetite, too, but everything felt like a sampler of a full-sized meal.
2	I used to go this place for AYCE a couple of time a week because it is near my house and because they had 3 things I really liked which I couldn't get elsewhere: a sashimi salad with oranges, a tempura yellowtail roll with avocado, and the best volcano roll anywhere. I got to know the chefs and they got to know what I liked, But the next time I came - the chefs had changed and I started all over.  That happened over and over.  Why is that? low pay?  Over time the chefs got sloppier and the recipes didn't get passed from one chef to the next...Several times the rice was either over or under-done.  I really tried to over look all the problems but finally I gave up.
4	Very good service. Sushi was great. Chefs were entertaining. All in All, this was a great experience.
5	I've tried a gazillion AYCE sushi places over the past 18 months. This place used to be great, and now they are back. Headed by a new sushi chef team, this place ROCKS again! If you like lots of raw fish and not a lot of rice, they have many different dishes for you. Start with the Tuna karai, cocaine, or screaming orgasm. The stuffed tomato (crab wrapped in raw salmon) is one of my favorites along with the burning down roll. They offer similar apps like all the other places. If you want top notch sushi, you gotta try it here. It's worth the drive!
2	I had been here once before about a year ago and remember it being pretty good.  However, I went in a few days ago to get take out and was highly disappointed.  The hostess/cashier was incredibly unfriendly and the food wasn't good at all (and went right through me too!).  Will not be going there again.
2	Yikes. I will never be returning to this sushi place even if it is the closest one to my boyfriend's place. I would much rather trek somewhere else.I got a Groupon for Yoko based off the fact it was close to my boyfriend's house. The Groupon was for $30. Originally I had planned on just ordering a few rolls that my boyfriend and I would split because he's not huge on sushi. He's more of a Cali Roll and "I'll try it, but won't like it" sushi eater while I'm the "I'll eat anything and probably like it" sushi eater. Therefore doing an AYCE typically isn't the best idea. However, the girl sold it to us because with the Groupon it would be like a buy one get one. Wish I hadn't done it.First off, the AYCE here is $25.99. Look, I'm not cheap, but if I'm going to pay $25.99 for anything it better be good quality and the sushi here is not good quality. The fish was okay, it was the preparation that was inconsistent and poor. Half of our rolls were terribly put together. Every time I picked one up the rice would fall off. There were a few pieces that didn't even have fish in them. The only rolls that looked like they had any time put into them were the specialty rolls. Also, the nigiri was kind of warm. Freaks me out when my fish is on the verge of being warm.The ambiance is nice, the seating around the bar was as well. They were playing some top 40s music and there was a decent amount of people there, but I won't be back, even if they do offer another Groupon.
1	I LOVE AYCE sushi and based on the fact that you are a marginally decent AYCE sushi joint will generally earn you AT LEAST 3 1/2 stars in my eyes.  That being said lets explain my one star rating.   All those comment about the sushi being average...yeah that's true.  There are soooooooo many good AYCE sushi places within like a 5 minute drive of here.  Sushi in Summerlin...Sushi Bomb....Sushi Mon..and yet this place is just well...lame.  Nothing great to speak of.   Go to these other places...they are better....BETTER.   Secondly I don't normally comment on service as I believe it is contingent on a luck of the draw kinda thing.  It's like playing roulette or something.  Unless the owner of the place waits on EVERY table in his joint you could be a great place and still have crappy service.  Plus the waitress' dog could have gotten run over or something and therefore he/she may not be feeling it.  But there are several reviews of this place that talk about RIDICULOUS service so I'm gonna hate on the service for a sec.  The audible sighing thing...yeah that happened to me too.  And I just asked for another roll.  It was so blatant that I thought I was at Dick's on the strip or something.  And it wasn't just once it was like SEVERAL times.  Weird Weird Weird.
1	Only if there was a 0/5 stars. Food: worst sushi place I've ever been too and I eat a lot of sushi. The sushi at this place taste like plastic and the portions suck. Its like 70% rice and 30% sushi and we all know the crab meat is imitation, so what part of it is even real fish? The only thing that was decent was the bento boxes. The most recent time I went there it was super dead, they had like 1 person there which I think was a groupon person because they were arguing with the customer about what their groupon really meant. Then I saw the waitress taping up a sign about groupon customers right in front of that groupon customer. How rude? Well back to my experience, when you order a bento box you get either a California roll or tuna roll with teriyaki, salad, fried veggies and tempura, and rice. Everything in the bento box was decent expcept the rolls. This sushi chef during lunch hours must've been new people my rolls weren't even rolls they were falling apart! and super small portions. Service: The waitress lady was kind of rude to the groupon customer and when it came to me she seemed to totally ignore my table. She never came to refill my drink or ever came to ask if I was doing okay. I had a hard time flagging her down to get my check I literally had to get up and walk to the counter and ask for my check. People there are better AYCE and Bento boxes at other sushi places. DON'T GO TO THIS ONE.
1	This place seems like it is under new management.  I went there many times in the past it was above average but now it is below average and was a great disappointment.  Service was poor.  Counters were dirty.  Personnel were unpleasant.  The place had about six other customers in the joint.  The food was poor, dry and full of rice with little meat.  This is simply my opinion and I will not go back.
1	I love trying out new food places. Since me and my boyfriend was around the area and was craving for some AYCE sushi, we decided to go here. I was a little skeptical because of all the bad reviews to this place. I first saw Yummy Sushi and Grill along the same neighborhood and had better reviews, but too bad they don't offer AYCE.When we walked inside the place, nobody was there but the waitress and one cook. They were both sitting down, probably waiting for customers. I didn't bother asking how much the lunch was since i had an idea that it would only be around $20 each person.First impression? DEAD. No music, just a TV with no sound at all. Employees looked so bored they didn't even bother greeting us whatsoever. I feel like the waitress was a little disappointed to see customers walking in. She has a little attitude.The smell of the place was horrendous, the place didn't feel like a sushi place at all. The menus felt sticky and dirty. Eww.So we ordered a few, i give them one star for not-so-bad sushi rolls. They were tasty, to be honest, but the thing is, the sushi rolls were not made well. Did i say they don't taste fresh? ALL the rolls were falling apart. The rice was not packed enough so it makes a huge mess whenever you pick up the rolls.Lemme tell ya, i'm a bit picky with my sushi rolls maybe because Sushi Kaya and Yama Sushi spoiled me so much...yes, in a good way. I love my rolls plated separately and accordingly so that the sauce wouldn't bleed or touch other rolls. Let's get straight to the point, their sushi rolls are all in one plate! 3 different kind rolls all in one plate. I ordered this sushi roll with lime juice in it, so it kinda has a sourness taste to it. Just because they were plated all in one plate, they all tasted sour-ish and limey too.And when you think of baked and deep fried rolls, they're supposed to be hot, right? Well total opposite!Now let's go to the desserts, when it says AYCE, it means you can eat all you want, but make sure to finish it. I understand their *one order per person* rule on some selections. I tried ordering Green tea ice cream, and Mango mochi, but the waitress was like, "no, you can't order more than one dessert!" Like whaatt?! In an AYCE?! I. CAN'T. EVEN....Check out: So when you check in to Yelp, you get this $5 off coupon. I showed it to the waitress using my iPhone, and then the lady literally TOOK my phone off my hand and brought it with her for a good 15min! I was in total shock during that 15min wait. Like really? I've never experienced anything like that before! LOL i don't even let anyone take my phone even for 5 sec and she just took it like it's just a paper coupon? Oh my gracious gravy.My total bill was $45 for 2 person. I believe their AYCE per person is $23 during lunch. NOT WORTH MY MONEY AT ALL. Definitely worth trying so i know which one to avoid. Hah.I'd say: save your money, go to Sushi Kaya or Yama Sushi!
4	Been to this restaurant location several times since I moved to Las Vegas, and I too think that ownership has changed a few times since my first visit 3+ years ago.Anyway, the sushi chef works hard to create the rolls and nigiri orders from customers in a timely manner.  He even gives update, such as the Fish and Chips Roll is being deep fried and will be ready in x minutes.  Although I was in no rush, I do appreciate being kept in the loop.  In business, just like in life, it is the little things that matters.As far as the food.  I have no complaint, except that uni is always out when I decided to go.  It could just me my poor timing plus it is not a deal breaker for me. I definitely don't think that it is a top AYCE sushi restaurant in Las Vegas, but it is fairly close by. On my latest visit, everyone there was in a good mood and enjoying the meal.  Service was good.  And I would definitely be back again.3.5 stars!
1	I'm really sorry that I cant say that this place has decent sushi. My buddy seems to love this place but I'm afraid its been so long since he's had good sushi that he no longer knows what it tastes like. This place sucks. Plain and simple....ridiculously small ingredients in the sushi rolls, shrimp tempura breaded like it was sweet and sour shrimp, green mussels that had no taste...need I go on? I will say that the service was efficient. We had no problems getting drink refills. The fact that the sushi rolls are 95% rice and 5% fish/other ingredients is not entirely surprising at an AYCE place but the fact that there are so many other places in town that serve up AYCE with great portions and exceptional taste ensures that I'll never return to this dump.
1	used to be my favorite place now since new ownership the food and service is very poor!
4	We have eaten here since 1999.  There were a few years that we avoided this sushi bar because the food was sub-par.  We started eating here sporadically about 3 years agoi and it was hit or miss.  About 18 months they hired two incredible sushi chefs.  Ryan is one of the two chefs, and he is still there.  There are two things that get you better sushi in this restaurant:  First get to know the owner (thin japanese lady in her late forties/early fiftties), and second talk to the chefs and get to know them.  Ryan is a great chef, and if you tell him what kinds of fish you like, he will make you the most exquisite dishes.  There are a few places that might have better sushi, but they are not AYCE (all you can eat).  I would much prefer to come to Yoko and pay them $20-$25 per person for AYCE, instead of paying $200-$250 for the few other places in town that might have a slight better taste.  Tell Ryan what kind of fish and how spicy you like it, and I guarantee you will be happy.
5	Yoko Sushi is the best place I have found since moving to Vegas a year ago. The fish is ALWAYS fresh and the conversation with Ryan, the head chef, is fantastic. After the first 2 times coming here he remembered my favorite roll (Happy Roll). It's truly an all you can eat place which WILL accommodate your desires.
