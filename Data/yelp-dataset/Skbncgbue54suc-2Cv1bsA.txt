3	Threadbare is a large basement level shop on Broughton Street stocking vintage clothing, jewellery, accessories and they also have a dress making service. They have a stack of vintage clothing and literally ever single inch of this shop is jam packed so it's great for a browse. I even stumbled across a few vintage designer items including two pairs of Yves Saint Laurent shoes.Do you ever get shops that you go into for a browse but as soon as you're there you feel like the staff are looking at you like you're up to no good and you automatically feel guilty for being there? That's exactly how I felt when I visited Threadbare the other week. I wanted to like Threadbare but the two staff members didn't bother with me at all when I walked in and were talking at the top of their voices about making a dress for a lady with a "big bottom". I was rummaging in a box of scarves when one of them turned to me and said; "Look, can we help you?" Rather than coming across like an approachable person I felt that that was my queue to leave. The overall browse wasn't very enjoyable and I couldn't wait to get out of there to be honest. On the way out I noticed that there was a whole section that I hadn't explored - maybe next time.Overall, they have nice items here but I kind of get the impression that if you don't look like you're going to buy anything then the staff aren't that bothered about you. I don't like being given the hard sell all the time but a "hello" and a smile are nice. If you're looking for vintage clothing then Threadbare is definitely worth a browse, the prices are reasonable for what they are and the items I saw were in very good condition.
