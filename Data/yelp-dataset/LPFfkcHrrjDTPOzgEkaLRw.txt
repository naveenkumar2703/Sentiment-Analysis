5	I can't even remember the last time I visited my money at this branch. I only opened this account because I got free banking since I had a mortgage with US Bank. The service here is great because the tellers know what they are doing. It saddens me that I'll have to close my accounts soon since I'll be refinancing my loan. You guys have been great, but nothing lasts forever.

1	Absolutely, without a doubt the WORST bank I've visited in AZ. The people at this branch are incredibly rude as well as just not caring at all. I was attempting a deposit of all things. Don't waste your time with this branch and after this experience, US Bank will get NONE of my money.Even their company website customer reviews for this branch are 2.5 out of 5!
