5	Root canal. The word even evokes a shudder of dread. It dredges up a very visceral response so many of us have to childhood fears of pain and scary noises. The dentist office now, as an adult, isn't much more fun. Happily, some places are at least more comfortable than others. I've had a lot of dental work done. A whole lot, truth be told. I was pretty worried when I found out I was going to have to go in for my first root canal.  But after being in a vicodin haze for over a week, it was time to get this tooth fixed.  Happily, the folk at Copper Star Dentistry got me in to the office within a day (a conflict in my schedule, not theirs) and had me on the way to pain-free within a single visit.  I can't recommend this place highly enough.  Excellent dental care.
2	First experience was an appointment for an exam. I was there for 4 hours. Apparently they were overbooked? Second experience was for an extraction of a wisdom tooth. Started off okay but couldn't get the tooth out. They took the X-rays they needed after the failed attempt. After examining the X-ray. He had to refer me to an oral surgeon. Their ill prepared attempt basically wasted time and money. Not to mention put me through more pain than necessary and intensified the discomfort I was already in. Needless to say all this has me pretty frustrated. The dentist and most of his staff were fairly friendly but unfortunately I would not recommend this place.
4	Dr Owens is wonderful! After a panic attack brought on by poor behavior at another dentist left me with a partially started root canal, Dr Owens was a breath of fresh air. One of his office staff is kind of a pain but everything else makes it a minor frustration. They are honest and compassionate which counts big when you have a lot of dental work needing to be done and not a lot of desire to do it.
