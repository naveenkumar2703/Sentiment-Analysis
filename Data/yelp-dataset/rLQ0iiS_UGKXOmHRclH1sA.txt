5	This is a very professional and reliable business! I've used them several times now with a few rental properties that I work with and even once for my own house and I've been very impressed with their response time and results. They've repaired refrigerators, stoves, and dishwashers for me so far (But I know that they do other items as well: Swamp coolers, water filters, pool pumps, heat pumps, air purifiers, compactors, disposals, central air and heat, and basic plumbing and electrical too). All of the guys are very knowledgeable, informative, and polite. They will go anywhere in the valley and will provide you with great customer service. Appliances are so expensive and so when something goes wrong - It's nice to have a solution to the problem and that's exactly what West Valley Repair Service provides.
1	Used to be very nice man enplane everything and show what it is.May 17th They sent me few very big guys I never see. They are very rude and mean.They told me they fill up my freon about 6lbd. It was only take them about few minutes. They took off very quickly and 5 minutes later it was all gone.  I call them back and same guys show up. And they are rude and mean till very end. NEVER USE THEM AGAIN.
1	Very bad AC service.  My blower motor in the attic wasn't working... So I called these guys after seeing their add on a local website.  Guy tells me $700 for new blower motor, new start capacitor and coil clean.  Lucky for me I called A different company for a 2nd opinion.  Next company out says it's just a bad capacitor.  $150 out the door!  Motor was fine and coils are in good shape.  West valley repair service is very dishonest.  2 months later my Ac is still working great.  Stay far away.  They try to take advantage of people.  They are liars.
