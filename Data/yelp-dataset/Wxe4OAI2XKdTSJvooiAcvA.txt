4	Took my car here because it sounded as if the exhaust was faulty. They inspected the exhaust, drove the car and came back and said that that wad not the issue. He also said that he would not yell me it needs fixed if it didn't. He then referred me to the guy at the shop next door.Wonderful service. Very knowledgable and friendly. I WILL definitely return here if I ever need a new exhaust.
5	Took my WRX here to get my down pipe welded to my catback exhaust. Great job and done right!!!! Would highly recommend!!!
