5	My friends and I were really impressed with the setup here at Photo Bang Bang.  We were in Las Vegas from Sacramento showing a film at Theatre 7 around the corner, and stopped in on the First Friday/Pollygrind kick-off event and had who I believe was likely the owner take some group photos of us in his back studio area.  The place had a great vibe and looked killer.  The set-up was something like a mad doctor's blood-soaked lab, or some kind of bizarre torture chamber.  While you wait for your turn, a monitor on the side displays some of his other photography (at the time, some kind of gimp-suited man torturing a foxy blonde), and all of that was really well done also.  We got to see our photos a few days later on Facebook and they came out great.  He even snapped some candids while we were getting our act together.  Great photography, great shop!  We took his card and I discovered that you can purchase prints of your visit as well.  Good stuff!
5	I want to update my review of Photo Bang Bang. ..I didn't understand the process of securing studio time at first, but using their automated reservation system worked smoothly! ...Was greeted by Co-owner Curtis,  he made the entire process so easy and fun! !...Was extremely helpful in setting up different background scenery and lighting equipment. ..I would absolutely without hesitation, use his studio again!
