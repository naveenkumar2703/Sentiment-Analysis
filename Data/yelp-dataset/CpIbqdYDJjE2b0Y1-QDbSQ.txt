5	I was recently out in Vegas for my brothers bachelor party. As the best man, I had a duty to plan the most bitchin' activities possible during the 72 hour debacle. Naturally, creating a faux biker gang was at the top of my list. I searched the internet high and low for reasonably priced scooters, and friends, look no further than Triple T's Moped Rentals. Our group of eight groomsmen literally had the time of our lives cruising up and down the strip on our hogs. I refuse to do Vegas any other way after experiencing pure bliss on two wheels. Triple Ts will work with you to deliver the mopeds wherever you want, and they'll even pick 'em up after you're done using them. It's a no brainer.
1	If I could give this company zero starts, I absolutely would. We rented 2 mopeds, and while we were riding on the strip in the middle of the night, one of our mopeds shut off while we were at a stop light. We were extremely far from our hotel already, and we had to walk the broken moped to a safe area and lock it up for them to pick it up. We had an amazing time riding the mopeds while it lasted. Even though he came the next morning to drop off two new mopeds to us, after riding them for a few hours, one of them would not start again. Their mopeds are not reliable, and I would highly suggest renting through a different company. The owner was disrespectful when we were trying to explain to him what happened, and he did not refund us any of our money back for the inconvenience. Instead, he claimed that we were lying even though he tried starting the moped in front of us and it didn't work. Overall, he was very rude, and not understanding at all. I will never do business with his company ever again.
