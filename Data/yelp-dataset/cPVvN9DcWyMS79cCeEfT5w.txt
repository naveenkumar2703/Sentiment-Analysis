5	Great spot for one of a kind items that are arty yet wearable.Hip yet practical.  And lots of stuff that was just plain fun.Thank you Jerry for the hands on service.And you exquisite taste and style.
4	This place is a cute little boutique store with pleasant owners!  They have clothes, jewelry and some nice spa gifts.  I bought one of their soaps because it matched my bathroom and was so cute and smelled awesome!  They have a good variety of clothing, some more traditional, some southwestern flare, others more hip, but all with a general artsy quality.  I LOVE their collection of Sunglasses, but I have like 50 pairs so I refrained from buying.  The prices are a bit steep, but the quality is outstanding and you can tell they use local/regional artists, which is always a plus in my book!
5	This place is  a gem!  The owners do an excellent job of finding artisanal items that are unique and of quality. There's a lot of one-of-a-kind pieces ranging from clothing, bags, belts, purses, jewelry as well as stuff for the home. If you are trying to find the perfect gift for someone (or yourself)  - A Cool Breeze is an excellent resource, especially if your someone/s is hard to buy for! I give it 10 stars... I'm glad that there are still stores like this around! When we are in Scottsdale this place is a must!
