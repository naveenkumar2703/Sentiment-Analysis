3	Instead of paying for a ride to the top of Stratosphere, just tell the host that you want to go to the Romance Lounge. It'll save you some money if you're planning on drinking or eating up there anyways.There is a one drink minimum but we were planning on drinking anyways. Of course the view is nice, but they don't make it easy with bars blocking your view from one of the lounge tables. The best views are either up top outside or at the Top of the World restaurant itself.We had some wine and beers and the prices weren't bad at all. I was expecting $10 beers, but they were like $7 or so.We had the sliders and they were pretty damn good. I assumed they would suck at a touristy lounge, but good work kitchen dudes.If you're at the stratosphere, just come up here, and then take the stairs up a few flights to have an awesome outside view!
4	Went on Valentine's Day for music & cocktails.  It's located on the 107th floor of the Stratosphere tower with a spectacular view of the strip and surrounds.  From that height people are as big as ants, and 18 wheelers look like tiny toy trucks.  No charge to get up there.  Other than that it's your typical, even cliche Vegas lounge.  There was the typical cliche Vegas entertainment too, a singing duo belting out standards.  Drinks were not too expensive, but seemed watered down a bit.  Definitely going to return for appetizers & a sunset.  4 stars for the unparalleled view.
5	Can't believe Im only the 3rd Yelper!! This place is amazing!! I have been here several times and have had great drinks and had fun every time.If you want a chill place with an amazing view of Vegas this is the way  to go. They sometimes have live music playing which is a bonus.One of the times I went it was for a private event during the trendy Las Vegas movie fest and I ended up meeting and hanging out with Ron Jeremy..so you never know who you will run into!Its a must visit if you have out of towners..it only costs you a drink.
