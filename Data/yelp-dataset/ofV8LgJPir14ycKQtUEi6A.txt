4	this is the best chinese in edinburgh. that is not saying tons, cause it just aint that good here. you want indian, you got the best, chinese is just ehhh.there is one thing they have here which i havent seen in other countries and pretty much the only reason to come here. crispy seaweed. its genius. ive been told its really just fried cabbage, but i dont really believe that. it doesnt matter what it is, it is crispy, flaked perfection with a funky herb thingy on it and peanuts.  nothing else is spectacular but get the noodles instead of the rice, not bad. the crispy shredded beef is probably the best and also part of the various set meals you can get if you are dining with others. sit in and delivery. if you get over a certain amount of food, they give you extra crap, ranging from those fish cracker things to an entire second entre, and you dont have to get that much, like 12 or 15 quid worth.good location on the shore in leith, makes a great sunday night to then play pub trivia at the cameo bar or just grab a pint across the street after at carriers quarters.
4	Having tried a few different Chinese restaurants for take aways, I tried China Palace and was really impressed. Great food and reasonable price. Best I've tasted in Edinburgh to date. Nice touch was choice of free dish with the meal (spring rolls or BBQ ribs). Will def. be using them again. Recommended.
1	I've eaten here several times over the years, and was never impressed. We ended up there again after a 4 year gap, and the food was a poor as I'd remembered. Service was OK, the mens toilets had red buckets under the urinals.My friend summed it up as "I suppose it might be OK if you were pissed", but I doubt it.
