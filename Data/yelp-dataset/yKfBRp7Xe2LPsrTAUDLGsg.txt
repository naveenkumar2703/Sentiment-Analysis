5	Liz is THE BEST stylist! I was always afraid to cut my hair short and she did it and it looked fantastic. She's been cutting my hair for years now. She's the best.
5	I have been having my hair done by Liz for a couple years now.  I receive so many compliments on my hair from friends & strangers.  Liz has also done my kids' hair.  My 9 year old won't let anyone else touch her hair after having Liz cut it for her.  She does great hair & an absolute pleasure to work with.  You should give her a call!
5	Liz is amazing! She was referred to me by several friends. Every time I've gone in and asked for something, she delivers beautifully! It's always a joy to go see her because I know I'm going to walk out with a great cut and color. I always get compliments on my hair after I've visited her. I also have her take care of my daughters' hair. Can't say enough good things about her!
5	I've been going to Liz for a couple of years now, She also cuts both my daughters hair.  I wouldn't trust anyone else with our hair but Liz. Liz is the best!!!
