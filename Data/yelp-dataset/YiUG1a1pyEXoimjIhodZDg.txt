3	A client's husband passed away and in calling florists to inquire of services, I finally gave up and walked into the local Safeway.Not the greatest selections, but in this pinch, they came through with a beautiful arrangement; affordable too.
4	This is the closest convenience store near my house and I really like the staff here. They open up new registers as soon as they see the lines getting long and they're really helpful and friendly.
1	I came here after reading online that this bakery would make custom cakes. After just visiting their bakery right now I now know that statement is false. They will only make cakes that are in their book and won't change a thing to customize it. The only change the lady in the bakery mentioned was that they could just ice a cake and sell it to me just like that and I could decorate it myself. What the heck seriously? I think that defeats the purpose of me buying a cake from a Bakery!
2	Decent selection of stuff, but typical of Safeway, they rarely have anything on sale. But the real real big complaint I have is they never have enough cashiers. 1 cashier open until it's 4 deep and you're waiting forever. It's probably worth saving the aggravation and drive the extra mile to Frys.
