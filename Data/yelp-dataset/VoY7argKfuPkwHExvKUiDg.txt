3	A nice bright looking shop again offering a good selection of diffrent styled cards.There are also some gifts in the shop.There cards are good for occasions like birthdays.Staff were helpful and approachable.
4	Located in Ocean Terminal this is a rather large branch of Clinton Cards with a fabulous range of cards, wrapping paper, stationary and gifts. I spent a lot longer than I should have done in here and picked up a few bargains along the way.As an animal lover, I was delighted that they had a range of little compact mirrors, pencils, pens and key rings with animals on them. Everything in the very cute range was reduced to 99p so I snapped up a few of the little compacts.I was hysterical when I noticed the most bizarre gift ever in the wedding section. It was a box saying "Congratulations on your Wedding Day" and inside was the cheapest looking bobble head black cat wearing a diamante collar and earrings. What? I don't know much about weddings and am not sure if this is some kind of tradition but I've certainly never heard of it before and it really was the most bizarre thing I've ever seen. I would love to see the look on the happy couples face when they open that up. Don't count on getting an invite to the Golden Anniversary party if you turn up to the wedding with such a gift. I urge everyone to go in to see it - it's hilarious!Aside their odd choice of wedding gifts, this branch of Clinton Cards is well stocked, very well organised and the staff are friendly too.
4	You know what to expect at Clinton. Inoffensive cards which will feature either lame jokes, a lame verse, cringeworthy soppiness / backslapping, or just a simple "happy birthday". On top of this there's loads of wrapping paper, stationary and small cuddly toys / trinkets.Hardly noteworthy, but certainly does the trick if you have friends or relatives devoid of both a sense of humour and a personality. That'll be all of them then.
