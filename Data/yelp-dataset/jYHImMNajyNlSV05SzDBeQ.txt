5	Such a great experience!  Jessica is super nice and talkative.  She makes you immediately comfortable and talks you through the waxing process.  She did a great job and was very professional!
5	I was getting married in 3 days and realized that I had totally forgotten to schedule a wax....ahhhhh! I started searching online and calling people, I left a message for Jessica and she called back and was able to work me in that day. God bless this woman! I was a stressed out bride and she calmed me down and made the wax a quick and painless experience. She is my go to person for waxing. I highly recommend Jessica.  She is awesome!
