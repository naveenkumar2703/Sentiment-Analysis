4	This Mcdonalds has a lounge area. It seems to be that all these mcdonalds have transformed from kids playgrounds to these fancy cafes. I guess it's cool and all except for, what happens to my future kids childhood memories? So, every morning I get before the 10am mark.. I like to grab my number 2. The sausage egg Mcmuffin. I always like to add strawberry jam to it. But here's why I only gave em 4 stars.. They're so tight fisted with their jam. Like they only have 6 left and they gotta store the rest up for the summer or something.
3	It's McDonalds!
1	The most inefficient McD's I've ever been in! 3 middle management people in different color Uniforms standing around, telling two employees to do everything, while they talk it up in the hallway. One cashier for a line of 4 + customers, open a line, help that poor kid out! Don't waste your time here, wish I could give it neg stars.
3	I like this place.. Its sort of near my house.. I just don't like that they close so early..
