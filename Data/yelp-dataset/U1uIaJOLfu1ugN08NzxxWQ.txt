5	Dr. Winston is incredibly versed in his profession.  He has a genuine concern for treating and improving the health of the animals he treats.  Dr. Winston is also very approachable and even maintains a way for his clients to reach him after hours in the event that a question arises regarding the health of their pet.  The staff at Sun City West Animal Hospital are very knowledgeable and personable.
5	It took one visit and prescription food to determine my dog has food allergies.  Scoobie is no longer miserable with his scratching.  If only dogs could talk.  Thank you Dr. Winston.  5 paws for the doctor.
4	My dog has received excellent care at Sun City West, and so has my mom's dog, a Boston Terrier who can be aggressive and difficult to deal with. I always feel like both dogs are treated humanely, with the utmost care, and I get a thorough, easy to understand explanation of any treatments that are being done. Prices for vet care here are reasonable, and Dr. Winston goes out of his way not to do any unneeded procedures that would bring up the price.
