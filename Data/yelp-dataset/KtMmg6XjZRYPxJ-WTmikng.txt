5	Great dentist.  I've been going to him for 6 years and he gives great dental care and his staff is wonderful.
5	If you are in need of a new dentist look no further. My whole family and most of my friends go here, we love it.. As much as you can a dentist. We started going here after our last dentist made a big mistake and filled the wrong tooth for a cavity of my husband and cause him a lot of pain. So glad we were recommended here, never had any problems here. Staff is friendly and professional. If you don't have dental insurance their cash payments are very affordable.
