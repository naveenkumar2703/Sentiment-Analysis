3	After trying out Pho Saigon 8 I came here to see what was in this little market. The store size although small has plenty of things to purchase. They carried plenty of noodles,produce, canned goods. The store also had some dishes and Chinese altar decorations.
4	Small, family owned store located in the corner of a shopping center, near Pho Saigon 8 and BBQ King. The popular Dakao for viet sandwiches is next door as well.This place may be small but they provide quite the amount of stuff. From a variety of fresh farm-raised non-caged chickens to a easy-to-cook soy bean curd to fresh vegetables. Their veggies may seem a little higher priced, but if they have in stock, it will probably be the best you can buy. Each bag is handpicked and bagged nicely so you have a smaller chance in running into "bad pieces" in your veggies. They do have a minimum on accepting credit cards tho. Believe it was either $5 or $10 min =X be careful ! (personal experience of almost not having enough cash to buy)
4	I have been shopping at this place for years now and love this small business. It really does cater to the locals with just about everything you can get in the bigger Chinese grocery stores, but on a much smaller scale.  The vegetables are fresh and there never is any line up.  That is why I like shopping here.  I recently went in to get some vegetables, but didn't have enough cash to purchase it.  The owner didn't want to accept a credit card payment of such a small amount, so she just told me to pay her next time. Can you believe it??  Who does that anymore???  I am guessing she probably doesn't do that for everyone.  But for me, it's just one more reason why I like shopping here.
