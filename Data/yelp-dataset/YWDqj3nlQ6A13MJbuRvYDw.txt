5	Never thought I'd review a supermarket, but since it's tough times for alot of people out there, I'd like to share my 2 cents..First of all, you don't need a card.  The deals are for everyone and it makes it hassle-free during checkout.  Now, about the deals ~ I find that Albertsons has the lowest prices and best deals and you can find them amonst any product you're looking for.  It's WAY cheaper than Safeway for sure.This is what i found yesterday:  88 cents for 2 (yes two!) snicker bars or other comparable chocolate bars, $1 for a bag of lifesavor hard candies, and $14.99 for a 24 bottle case of coors light.  They also had 69 cent bags of frozen veggies that people were buying like crazy.  Also, this location has really good cuts of meat.  I'm Korean and was so excited that they had short ribs cut perfectly for Kalbi jjim (korean braised shortribs), and for $3.99 a pound, it was quite a deal!
4	There is something depressing and out dated about this store. Prices are not too bad but often more pricey. Their produce is mediocre. Their staff is pretty nice though. I am mainly rating on their pharmacy. A+++. We've been going here for 6 years for our pharmacy needs and they are just fantastic.
4	We love coming here to shop for groceries.  The parking is spacious and they keep the store clean and well organized.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kf3iHoF_pQ4TXRfNYpHTOQ?select=XBsrIfil9YRcS1DS8ufdmQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kf3iHoF_pQ4TXRfNYpHTOQ?select=TiCNHriXw3tgUQShZ7-KMAThey also have a good selection of Wine....yum!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kf3iHoF_pQ4TXRfNYpHTOQ?select=Kp4nvYrxcURzmeZiXBQUuAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kf3iHoF_pQ4TXRfNYpHTOQ?select=9hDt7Xm8pyPFRMbpltngKwThe only thing I haven't been able to find here is the Pizza Crust from the Bakery that I used to get in the Albertson's in Vegas....apparently, they don't make them here.  Bummer!Return Factor - 90%
4	Clean and good prices
5	I think this store gets the honor of my first grocery store review. This is the closest grocery store to my work so I often stop by during lunch or on my way to/from work if I need to grab anything. I also use it for food and supplies for office events. The staff is top class and I always have a pleasant experience. I wish they were my neighborhood store :(
3	Gonna throw this out there... I'm not a big Albertson's fan. I do not frequently shop at Albertson's and in the past few years, I have only been to this location twice. Once was on a fluke - I needed a sweet treat for work and purchased a box of cookies from the bakery. The second time was to pick up a quail block. (A block of birdseed for quails.) I specifically came to Albertson's because my mother told me Albertson's carried them. (Other stores did not.) The inside of this Albertson's is pretty dismal with low lighting and cramped aisles. When I came on a Saturday, prime grocery shopping time, there were only three or four other shoppers in the entire store. That's kind of sad. Even the employees seem pretty sad. Not sure what Albertson's needs, but definitely needs to compete with Safeway, Fry's, and Bashas.
