3	Not the cheapest gas, but I come here to occasionally get a car wash and a couple of energy drinks to fuel the day.  I wish the cheaper gas price included a debit option but you can't have everything in life right?  People in the store are friendly and the gas store food selection is decent.  Not too bad for making pit stops on the way to and from work when I have cash on me and my price point for gas is lower than usual.
4	Four stars because this place, honest to goodness, has some of the cheapest diesel prices in town. Try to go anywhere else and find them lower than here. You may be able to find some further down on Nellis toward the Air Force Base, but this place has CHEAP gas.My car runs on diesel so finding it cheap is hard to come by. Not to mention this gas station is about 5 minutes from my house. Note - you do have to pay cash to get the lowest price.
3	I only pay at the pump so I never go inside.  It's close to where I live and easy to get in and out.  Every once in a while I'll use the Carwash.  I have seen better prices but for convenience this is on the corner of the intersection that I use the most.  No problems and no complaints.
