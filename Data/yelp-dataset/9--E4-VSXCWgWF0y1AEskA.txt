4	Dont let the average sounding and seemingly generic menu put you off for this place, even though you will have had a million szechuan chickens from a million chinese take aways, this place is different - it seems every dish has a unique twist that nearly always makes the dish taste amazing.Staff are friendly and more importantly they are quick - if you order here, you wont be waiting more than a few minutes until you get your meal. The take away service is equally efficient, which is nice. A great place for traditional chinese food with a twist.

The girl who works the counter is always so lovely and the order is always ready when they say it's going to be. I think once I had to wait, but she was so apologetic and it's not a stretch to wait a few extra minutes. The food is the westernised version I think most of us know, but it is delicious and they gave amazingly generous portions of meat and seafood. We always get the sweet and sour shrimp Hong Kong style and the Szechuan noodles and they never disappoint!! A great go to when we don't feel like cooking. It also isn't expensive, and with the portions, so worth it!!! Lovely staff and lovely consistent food. Definitely a must if you live in the area.
