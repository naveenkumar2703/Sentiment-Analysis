5	Fantastic wines, they know there stuff, i just describe what i like in a wine and they find it no probs, never been disappointed, great customer service, and i guess you get what you pay for.
5	This is an excellent beer and wine shop, part of the Edinburgh group of three or four shops.I generally go in to buy beer. There is a very good selection of slightly different beers, with a regularly changing selection. The guys know their beers and I've had countless beers on their recommendations.There is great selection of wine too, and I've had some very nice bottles from there too, again backed with proper knowledge.The shop run beer and wine tastings throughout the year too.One of my favourite shops to visit for a chat and to pick up something new and unusual.If you're feeling adventurous and there is any in stock, try the Mikkeller Texas Ranger. Insane.
5	As an establishment, Vino is pretty much just another chain where you can buy reasonable quality wine, beer, and spirits.  In this respect, it is no better and no worse than Drinkmonger or any of the other boozy chains still in existence.Where this Vino gets 5 stars from me is the service.  I've been here a handful of times over the past few months and every time I've been greeted by incredibly friendly and helpful staff.  Last time I was in, the computer was showing that they were out of the Edinburgh elderflower gin.  One member of staff overhead my exchange with the cashier and just as I was about to buy something different, he put the elderflower gin on the counter, explaining that he was sure he had seen a bottle somewhere and had been looking for it when he first heard my comment.  What was especially great about this, was the fact that I was going to buy something anyway and he really didn't need to make the effort, but it was *much* appreciated.So - its offerings are standard and perfectly fine, but 5 stars for customer service!
