2	Is "Arizona's Best BBQ" hidden behind Famous Dave's BBQ in Peoria? Well, yes and no. The sign out front boldly declared it but I'm not too sure myself...Personally, I'm often a bit of a contrarian as in I like to look for the non-obvious. In my continual quest to find something redeeming about Peoria, I find a BBQ place tucked behind Famous Dave's and right next to Arrowhead Harley- so I figure that this'll be my hidden gem, right? I mean, a small BBQ place literally behind a chain operation like Famous Dave's has to either *really* bring or they'll soon be out of business, right? Well... not to be mean but something tells me that there will be a space for rent in not too long...Not that anything was really terrible. The staff was friendly enough. I ordered the half-rack of ribs with two sides. It was $14. Sure, there were lunch sandwiches in the $7-$9 range but BBQ to me means ribs. And for $14 in a "hole in the wall" place should be large portions and fabulous. I really can't say it was either. And I wanted to like it. The portions were OK but not $14 in size or quality. I almost wanted to hit up Chipotle on my way out of Arrowhead... I'd definitely skip this place...
3	I have been to this restaurant several times and actually really enjoyed it.  The other reviews appear to be somewhat mediocre, but I really feel their foods flavor made it worthwhile.  I will definitely be back and now that I am sitting down to do a review, I am going to head there today for lunch.  : ){UPDATE}  Well  - I went back there for lunch today and they were closed, and long gone from what I could tell.  It was a mexican restaurant and I will not be eating there.  It looked kind of dirty actually. Well, goodbye AZ BBQ!  In case anyone wonders, I ate over at Famous Daves.  Kind of sucked.
