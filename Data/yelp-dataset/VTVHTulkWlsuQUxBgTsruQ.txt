1	The customer service is awful.  They did not return my calls.  My furniture was delivered 3 weeks later than promised, they gave me a one day option and 2 hour window for delivery and did not work with me regarding delivery time even though the furniture delivery was much later than promised.  They needed to come back to repair it after they delivered it.
5	If you want amazing office furniture and tons of choices, this is the place to go!  I have purchased 3 pieces from Jason so far.  I started w/desk and file cabinet which I just love, very classy and beautiful.  Then I moved and needed a cradenza.  We went back and ordered a matching piece.  Worked with Jason again with ideas for that piece.  He never tried to upsale me, always tried to save me money and work with me.  I ended up going with the better piece to match my current desk exactly, just because I loved it SO much.  I'm so glad I did, it looks so outstanding.  The quality of their work and craftmanship is incredible.  I now look forward to going back and looking at their home store for chairs for front room!!!  This is one quality company to do business with!!!
5	We bought an Aspen Home Downing Street partners desk from Jason and we are so pleased with both the piece and the customer service we have received. Jason was very helpful, informative and patient with us when we were deciding on what we wanted. He was also available via email to finalize the purchase which made the transaction very convenient on our behalf. We have also dealt with Joe and Marcus from Salt Creek Office Furniture who were both just as great! Our study is the first room you see when you walk into our home so we wanted something that would be elegant and make a statement. We couldn't have chosen a better office set! We receive many compliments on the desk and have referred all of our friends and family to Salt Creek Office Furniture.
