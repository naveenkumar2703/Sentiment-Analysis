4	This store is a regular supermarket and not one of the Tesco Express shops. I shop here regularly due to the proximity to my workplace but I have wider experience of the large Tesco superstore in Dumfries.This Edinburgh store is much smaller than the Dumfries store which also sells electricals and clothing. This store doesn't have the capacity to sell the full product range and so is only useful for grocery shopping. Nevertheless, the staff are friendly and helpful while the range of foodstuffs is adequate but not quite as varied as the larger stores. Prices are higher here too compared with the Dumfries store where much better value can be had.If I was reviewing the Dumfries store I would have given it 5 stars but it loses a star due to the restricted range and slightly higher prices. The store is clean and well maintained and secure parking is plentiful and easily accessible for a city centre store. Accordingly parking is restricted to a maximum of 3 hours so don't leave your car here all day or you may incur significant charges.
