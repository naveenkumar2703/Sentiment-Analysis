5	I recently moved to Gilbert (from Las Vegas) and hadn't been out too much to explore until my friends came to visit. I loveee ice cream and had received a coupon in the mail from Rock N' Robyn, so I figured what better time than now to try it?! The staff at the time were two ladies, (I didn't catch their names unfortunately) the blonde one was very upbeat and friendly when she greeted us. Our ice creams were large and in charge to say the least! I was very pleased with the generosity, and to top it off the ice cream was Thrifty brand (which is no longer available in Vegas!) :). One of my friends asked the same staff member for water and she informed us that their machine wasn't working. She then proceeded next door to Subway and obtained water for all of us. I was very shocked, her humility and kind actions made me feel very comfortable and special (haha). I'll definitely being frequenting this place as often as my stomach allows for the great ice cream and amazing costumer service!!!
