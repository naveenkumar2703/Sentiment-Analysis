1	Called because the website offered a free consultation. This turns out not to be the case. I would have to "pay for an exam". Don't be misled. Another dentist only interested in money & not concerned about the patients well being.
5	Best dental practice ever!  I have major anxiety over any dental work (even cleanings), and through the past 8 years they have really helped me get over my anxiety.  The hygienist is by far hands down the best.  Although we haven't had any major work done here, just cleanings and minor teeth fillings, I would never switch. And we just started taking our 2 year old here as well, I didn't necessarily agree with pediatric dentistry which includes holding them down, doing xrays at 2 years old etc etc....so our toddler goes with us, she plays with the toys and brushes the animals teeth - after we get our teeth cleaned they check her mouth out and make it comfortable for her.  While I'm certainly in no way discrediting pediatric dentistry - I'm just simply saying that in my own personal belief, I prefer to have my child looked at differently.Great Place!
