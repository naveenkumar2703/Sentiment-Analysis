5	It's a great church, Protestant & evangelical. Good messages and comfortable to be there. Great coffee shop in house, & yes you can bring it in with you. Excellent programs for your kids.  2 services Sunday am.  Music is pretty contemporary - wish they'd add some country or more familiar music as a part of the service, though.
5	This has been your church for about 3 years now consistently on Sundays.   They have a brand new worship center (just opened two weeks ago) you have to check out.  Great sound system and place to worship and understand GOD. We don't take part in many of the activities offered and there are many if so inclined.  This church has a large following, two services of 500 plus, plus 200 kids in different Sunday school programs (by age) not around the adults.  They are very consistent with time also and keep the service to almost always 1 hour promptly.   What we find most appealing is the casual environment too the learning and understanding of GOD that this Church offers.  We first attended wearing Suits and dresses and felt very uncomfortable that first time.  Today was shorts and a golf shirt.  "God doesn't care what we look like, just that we care" and I believe that Pastor Fox would say the same as he pastors in his Kakis, Golf shirt and sketchers most times.   Service always starts with a contemperary worship of about 4 songs.  Today was 2 acoustic guitars and a cello.  Sometimes they have 3 to 4 singers, drum set, electric, acoustic & bass guitars and piano/organ.  More new age not the old classics.If you are new to God or want just want to renew knowledge and grow what a great Church...
5	This is a strong Bible directed church. There is a real effort made with kids to help facilitate growing up Godly young people. My three youngsters love it as much as my wife and I.
