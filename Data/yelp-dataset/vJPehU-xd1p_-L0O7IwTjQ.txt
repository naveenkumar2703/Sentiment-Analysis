3	Hey, 3 stars is good....for what you are getting. So I called LC up and asked instead of the el cheapo $5 pep pizza, if I could get a ham.... The guy said sure but it is 6 bucks. Eh ok...So I ask him to make it the way he would want it. He suggests adding parm/butter crust. Sounds good....It was a really good pizza and I appreciated the guys suggestions.
4	We get some custom vegan pizza from here every once in awhile and we dig it!Our usual order is the veggie pizza, no cheese, plus banana peppers & pineapple. Their crust & sauce is vegan, making it a good option for us. It's quite tasty! We also normally add an order of crazy bread with no parmesan cheese.Staff is normally friendly and professional. Food is made quick, even for made-from-scratch orders like ours.
5	all things considered this place rocks. Price, speed, quality all 5 stars. The wings are good too, nice pepper flavor in there.
4	If you are looking for an $8 pizza that is READY RIGHT NOW, this is your place. I've never had to wait on a Supreme, even if there is a bunch of people waiting on pizzas. Apparently they often get behind on Pepperonis for $5, and custom orders always seem to have people waiting for them.This is NOT as good as Sardella's across the street - but it's an $8 pizza ready to go.
