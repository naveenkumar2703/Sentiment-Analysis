4	its the court house who wants to be on jury duty? but it does have A/c
2	First time here this week.  There was a little confusion on my part regarding parking and they refused to validate the parking ticket so I ended up having to pay $12 for it, which is hard for me given my current financial situation.  I was also rather eager to be selected for a jury as I have never been on a jury before even after having been registered to vote since I was 18 and having a valid drivers license before.  This is the 6th time I have been summoned by an Arizona court.  3 of them got dismissed before I had to go in, twice (including this time) I pretty much just sat in the waiting room until they dismissed us, and only once I made it to jury selection but I was one of those dismissed.I found that a bit disappointing though I realize it's really not anyone's fault.  It'd be nice if they had something entertaining on TV and sound like they do in the Pima County Court system...Last time I was called in I got to watch 50 First Dates which was amusing and helped make the time fly by a bit faster and lessened the blow of having to sit around all day.
