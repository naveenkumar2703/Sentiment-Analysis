5	I was immediately handed a beverage and asked to play a highly entertaining round of cards against humanity. These ladies are awesome. Come hang out here.
5	One of the best places ever! Good drinks, good snacks, great people! Definitely worth a visit!
5	Best place to sleep on the floor, hands down. So many activities.
5	This place is great! I was in LA and just ended up here. I was handed beverages and partook in a giant pants-off dance-off. Sleeping situation was awesome! As long as you're not a square and sleep super early, you have your pick at any space on the ground; if you haven't tried it yet, it's a must do at The Cottage.
5	It's a spectrum.  It's a magical place.  Lodging, drinks, dinner, twerking, anything one may ever imagine.1. You are always welcome at The Cottage (as long as you climb through the dog door)2.  Keg stands are possible using the ceiling3.  There are often underpants on the front lawn4.  Razors can be found in the mailbox5.  The animal is part 8 Mile and part bear.  Ignore the bald spots6.  After enough alcohols, the pool start to look like it's been filled up with sand7.  Drive by slowly enough, and The Cottage will MORDOR!!! at you.8.  100% functional plumbing is for sissies9.  The Cottage is accepting of loose women, including Dances10.  HIMYM plays nonstop, even when all residents of The Cottage are out of state11.  It's fine to wear your bicycle helmet to bed, because you just need to feel safe12.  Watch out for the hole in the bed13.  5' ladies or 5' 9" men can dunk.  Magic I tell ya14.  There is not a one matching tupperware container and lid15.  That "lawn" is stronger than a sturdy red cow.
5	The cottage is just a lovely place, as are all of its residents.  It's a hop skip and sometimes 2.5 miles away from many great drinking establishments!If you ever need a place to sleep on the floor or find something to sleep under, they will even take in a Whores wandering the streets.
5	Free lodging even includes dog cuddles!
