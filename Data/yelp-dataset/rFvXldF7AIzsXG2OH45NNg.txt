5	I started going to the studio in June 2008 after a friend convinced me to check it out and have been hooked since!  The variety of classes is great, and the times they have available make things soooo convenient. (6am workout anyone??!!)  I even took a certification course they hosted, and now teach 4 classes a week.  The best part is the free intro class so you can try before you buy!
4	I love Pilates Tempe. There are a wide variety of teachers to suit every taste. Each of them are very eager to adapt exercises to your personal abilities and take any injuries or limitations into account. Even if you haven't worked out in forever, you will be able to find a good class to improve with. On the other hand, there are a couple really challenging teachers--my personal favorites : ). Prices are super reasonable and there are a variety of monthly packages available.
5	I came here to get stronger due to being rear ended in a car accident.  I was having issues with back pain, but I wanted to strengthen as well as feel good.  You go through an initial how to work the machines and how to adjust for your sensitive areas first, before you can even sign up for classes.  A little intimidating at first, but most helpful.  You'll want to go through a few classes to find your right instructor(s) that best fit your needs and push you in the right way.  For any of them, don't be afraid to ask for help to make sure you feel it or if it's uncomfortable.  My favorites are Ashly and Erin.  I also really like the stretch classes on Wednesday.  Pricing is very reasonable and the booking site also has a mobile app, very convenient if you need to make changes or add classes while you are thinking about it.
