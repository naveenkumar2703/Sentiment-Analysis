5	Father and son, Bob and Ben, have been taking care of my home for many many years.  I rarely if ever have issues.  We recently sold our home and moved into a rental and I plan to continue using Gordon Family's services for as long as they are in business.  Great, nice, friendly guys, truly a local family run company and the rates are very reasonable.  I highly recommend the Gordons.
5	Recently purchased a second home in Arizona that was serviced by Gordon Family and decided to continue the relationship since they were familiar with the properties history. Although I live in Canada and payment was delayed, they still conducted their usual treatment on good faith that the check was in the mail. Very easy to talk to and a very good value base on other companies that solicited me. I sleep very well knowing my home is in good hands.
5	Bob and Ben are fantastic. The home I rented had a HUGE tick problem. They showed up the very next day and meticulously sprayed inside and outside. Bob thoroughly explained how difficult it is to treat for ticks due to their reproduction rate and said to call immediately, day or night, if I saw even one more. The infestation was so bad that the house had to be treated 5 times. They never once charged me for the extra trips because they guarantee the quality of their work. They ALWAYS arrived at the exact scheduled time and because of their diligence and exceptional service, the problem was solved. I couldn't be more pleased with the quality of service.
5	Still using these guys.  On my third property with them and wouldn't think of using anyone else.  Thanks, Bob and Ben!!!
