5	Started going to Cassie on a recommendation from my husband when I moved to Madison a couple of years ago. I'm glad I did as the atmosphere is private, welcoming, and I got what I wanted for my hair every single time. I would go back, but recently moved out of state. I will be making the trip to Madison every once in a while and will be coordinating those with haircuts.
5	I started to going to Cassie while she was with another company 4 years ago when I moved to Madison. I am very particular when it comes to who cuts my hair so finding a new hair stylist is always nerve racking. The very first time Cassie cut my hair I knew she was perfect. She took into account what style I was going for as well as offering tips on how she thought she could improve the cut. After she was finished it was exactly what I wanted and I never went to a different stylist my entire 4 years in Madison, following her to her new salon. I would definitely recommend getting your hair cut with Cassie if you live in the Madison area as she really knows what she is doing! I just recently moved out of state but whenever I am back in Madison I will make sure to get an appt with Cassie before I leave!
5	Cassie is great at making you look great!  I am terrible at explaining what I want done but she always seems to get it or figure it out or make it happen - she is a rock solid colorist - I trust her completely - also the price is right!  My husband and my kids get their hair cut by Cassie too - we all think she is awesome!
5	Cassie has cut my hair 3 or 4 times now and it has been great every time. Her spot is super nice, relaxing, and she plays awesome music which is a huge bonus. Being a dude, I never really went to real salons much and instead went to places like cost cutters and cheap clips (yuck), so not only is the experience a huge step up, but the quality of the products and end results are much better as well. Top notch!
