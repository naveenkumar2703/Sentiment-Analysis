3	It has it's pros and cons. Cute bartender tho
5	They have Smithwick's on tap!  Good place to catch games.
3	This is a locals place with what seems like an older crowd mainly 60 plus at least on St. Patricks Day.  It is your typical neighborhood dive with ok corned beef & cabbage.  They did have a band which was a plus even though they were the same age as the crowd here they were good and made the atmosphere of the place.  It's ok for a place to stop in for a drink.  The food was ok as well.The waitress seems to e about the age of the crowd and is really not all there.  We said hello to her on the way in as we walked oases her and sat in a booth next to a table she was serving.  Needless to say, she never noticed us and we had to get up to get her to tell her we were here and wanted some drink & food.  If a crowd comes in like it happened here, forget about it....
