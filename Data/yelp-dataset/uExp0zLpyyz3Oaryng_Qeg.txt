4	Chef Sammy D and Antonio Ballatore have a great little gem on their hands. Amazing graffiti wall to wall, great food, a well stocked bar, and a mechanical pickle!The Graffiti is done by many artists (way too many to name), everywhere you turn there more art, there isn't really a surface that was left untouched. There are also QR codes all over so that you can find out more info about the piece/artist (QR codes should be operational in about a week). The bar was showing a interesting video medley of music videos, old tv show clips, and videos of all of the artists painting the walls.The menu is pretty big, there's an entire section of pickled items, a salad selection, an expansive burger menu, plus a decent side of fries. The Kitchen was insanely fast and our food arrived pretty much right after we ordered.We started with Pickles, the LVS Fries (which are Sammy D's take on poutine), and BBQ Pork Doughnuts. The  Pickles were good nothing special, but a nice start. The LVS Fries are a unique twist on Poutine, Hand Cut Fries with Gravy, Cheddar Curds, and a pepper (maybe a touch too much pepper) but all in all a great side. I had the Wildstyle Burger, a big patty (cooked to a perfect medium rare), Smoked Gouda, Pulled Pork, Cole Slaw, and pickles on a Pretzel Roll. The burger was much bigger than I expected from a place on the strip. The flavors blended together well, my only regret was not adding the Nueske's Bacon.  The meal ended with a present from Antonio Ballatore, he sent over a free order of the BBQ Pork Doughnuts. Imagine a deepfried pastry filled with delicious bbq pork, coated in honey sauce, with a hint of pickled jalapeno, served up in a basket. A great combo of savory and sweet.The Bar selection was impressive, a wide variety of beers on tap, several seasonal and micro brews that are not readily available anywhere else on the strip. They also have Jameson Shots with a pickle back, drink them both and get a token to ride their mechanical  pickle, you you read that right they have a mechanical pickle that you can ride.I will go back and give it a more formal review, this was just a soft opening and there were a few glitches (nothing major). The food was great, the portions were bigger than I expected, the price point is right on par for the strip, and it's conviently located next the Venetian Poker Room and Sports Book, which IMHO is a great location for a Burger Joint.
5	Wow,love this new place,it's a must check out. It's not the usual place ,very unique place. Has some nice, crazy looking paintings from top to bottom. Has so many choices of beer,and food. We got treated very very nice,got served quickly. The burgers are the best I've had and I've had almost every place there is. Burgers Are HUGE and good,those fries are the bomb!!! Kids and wife loved it!! Rode the famous pickle ride and played the arcade games. The music was perfect !!!! This place is great to hang out and have some drinks .It's right on the strip,only restaurant on the strip at Venetian,with patio right on the strip!  HAs it all,TV's,Strip patio,Music,and  great food!!!  Will be Back!!!!
5	MY NEW FAVORITE BURGER SPOT. Killer! I was at the soft opening yesterday so I did not get to order off the full menu, but everything we had was great. The Rattlecan Burger was amazing. DEFINITELY THE BEST BURGER I HAVE HAD IN VEGAS... and that takes on some pretty strong burger joints. The Hot Mess is one of the most unique dishes I have seen in a while...think of it like a comfort food Bi Bim Bop., Great micro beer selection.then, the KILLER ART! The place is completely tagged by some of the best graphitti artists in the country. Solid classic, indie and alternative rock music playlist. I have more respect for the Venetian Hotel now--this was cool and contemporary and i bet it becomes the hot new destination restaurant in Vegas. Go now while the lines are still short.and ride the mechanical pickle! what a hoot.going back this week to try the full menu...I have my eye on the WILDSTYLE Burger...I will let y'all know.
5	Pink & Juicy, Perfect.  If this place doesn't get too crowded too soon, as all the great burger places do, I might be here every week.Cool Space, sat outdoors.  Glassware is cool. Good way to eat between games across from the Sportsbook at Venetian.Told it was a limited menu, but not sure what else I would want.
5	Great burger at Rattlecan! I had the namesake, Rattlecan burger, and loved it!! They also had this deep fried pickle concoction with cream cheese and it was amazing! You definitely have to try! It's hidden under the pickle section of the menu though! Desserts was fun too! Can't go wrong with S'mores and when you add them to sweet potato fries...BOOM!Definitely worth checking out!Two thumbs up for service as well! Brooke was great!
4	I have been intrigued by this place ever since they started painting and tagging all the walls with "Rattlecans". I have read reviews from my fellow Yelpers, so I had high expectations for this spot.My coworkers and I stopped in after work. They were almost closed, so we rushed in, grabbed a seat, and ordered as fast as we could. Our server was very friendly and answered all of our many questions very well. Great selection of beers on tap and in bottles. The whole time you're there you cant help but focus on all the amazing tags and art surrounding you. The atmosphere and ambiance is great!For my burger selection I ordered the "All-City" burger which was great. You can't go wrong with Nueske Bacon and Bleu Cheese Crumbles on a perfectly cooked burger. The bun was fluffy, and perfect. I definitely enjoyed my burger. For my beer selection I asked some questions to the waitress, because I definitely needed some guidance when selecting any beer. I asked if a Ballast Amber from Cali was hoppy or malty because I was going for more of a light ale. She suggested it would be light, and not hoppy. In fact the beer was hoppy and not in the direction I intended to go. I give some lee-way because they are a brand new establishment and the burger was delicious. If i had one recommendation for this restaurant, i would recommend staying open a bit later. Closing at 11, not cool for a bar/burger joint!  All my coworkers absolutely enjoyed all of their meals and we will definitely be back again.. as long as we get cut early.
4	Whoa.  I've been a big fan of Burger Bar and BLT Burger for many years and had pretty low expectations of yet another Strip burger joint.  I was very wrong.  The atmosphere, while not really my thing, is fun, youthful and energetic.  More importantly, the burgers and sides are crazy good!  Ate here two consecutive nights having an Angus burger with grilled onions and Maytag bleu cheese each night...onion rings one night and fried green beans the other.  Couldn't believe how fresh and amazing the whole experience was, including the awesome Dog Fish Head 90-Minute IPA.  Love burgers? Get here ASAP!
4	Okay so 11pm on a Friday night and this place was pretty much empty. In fact when we were checking in we told them we had a reservation and they laughed at us. True it was comical, here you have this massive graffitied out cave of a space with old school metal (Ozzy, etc) blaring over the loudspeakers and we're kind of the only table in there. Since being only open for a few weeks maybe word has gotten out that they're open. Though for Vegas it seems kind of weird. Service was friendly though really green (didn't know her beers very well and for a place thats a lot about beer thats no good) but again they are new. But the burgers, let me tell you what, those were fucking awesome! Seriously! I had the old school with LTO extra patty and american cheese slathered in thousand island dressing.. its like In N Out on steroids! The fries were pretty average which was lame cause a great burger deserves great fries. If you get a chance order the pork donut appetizer, do it! Sweet, porky, fabulously greasy fried awesomeness! Also in case you were wondering the servers and bartenders here are sexy as hell!
5	Love this place! We've been there three times since it opened last month. The burgers are probably the best I've ever had - big, juicy and delicious! The atmosphere/decor is great and the staff is super friendly. The manager introduced himself and gave us a quick tour of the restaurant, including the outdoor patio next to the Venetian canals and the Strip. Can't wait until warmer weather to hang out on the patio. Overall, the food is great, and if you like pickled veggies, you should definitely try the pickle sampler, which includes several types of pickles, pickled veggies, and a pickled egg.
4	Yelp told me this was a hot new place, so I figured I give it a try. Initially I had a bit of a tough time finding the place, as there was no hint as to where this was from the Yelp reviews. Turns out it is in the Venetian casino area. It's new enough that when I asked someone who worked at the Venetian where it was he said: "I don't know. Is it new?"I ordered take out from the bar as I was grabbing something to go to eat with my girlfriend. I was not too big of a fan of the atmosphere of the restaurant, luckily I was getting food to go. I ended up ordering a veggie burger, an ahi tuna burger, fried pickles, and pickled beets. All told around $50. While I was waiting for the food, I figured I would grab a beer. It took me a bit to decide what I wanted, and when I finally decided it turns out that the beer was nearly tapped out so there wasn't a full glass to be had. While the bartender went to look to see if the keg could be swapped, the food came. I was surprised at just how quickly the food came. So in the end, I got to taste the beer, but did not actually sit and drink a beer. Oh well, maybe next time.Now onto the food! My girlfriend and I ended up sharing the burgers. The veggie burger seemed like typical fare to me, having previously been a long time vegan, though when my girlfriend tried it she exclaimed "I don't think this is a veggie burger." So it apparently does a decent enough job of masking that it is a veggie burger for some folks.The veggie burger was topped with guacamole and was pretty good. I thought the burger itself was a little over done, but overall yummy. The ahi tuna burger, was tasty as well, but my girlfriend and I both agreed that the veggie burger was still a little better.Now for the pickled delights! This is the first time I've had fried pickles before, and I have to say I really liked them! It's definitely worth a try. If you've had pickled beets before, well these will taste pretty familiar. Overall, I liked the pickled fare as a nice compliment to the burgers, though I really like pickled stuff.Overall it was nice. It is a change of pace from a lot of the other burger joints in the area.
4	Rattlecan feels misplaced in the Venetian, and I mean that as a compliment. I picture a graffiti-themed burger joint in Hard Rock, Palms or Cosmopolitan. Nevertheless, this place is definitely holds its own among other famous burger places on the Strip.I ordered their namesake burger The Rattlecan - Angus beef, cheese, bacon,caramelized onions, pickle, special sauce, lettuce, tomato on a brioche roll. It came with crinkle cut fries for $16. Not bad for a big juicy burger considering Strip prices. I splurged and topped it with an egg for an extra $2. Let me tell you... my burger ROCKED! They also have an impressive beer menu. You have the option of sitting outside with a good view of Las Vegas Blvd. Combined with a cool atmosphere, rock music, good service and a mechanical pickle, Rattlecan is an experience that I recommend if you're looking for a solid burger on the Strip.
3	Went here with a friend on an apparent slow day. The place was pretty empty and felt a bit too urban for the Venetian. I imagine this place downtown in hipster-ville or Town Square, but it felt so odd at this casino. In other news the prices are steep for what you get. We ordered the sliders which I believe were $12 dollars. We received 3 White Castle tasting burgers. They were good and came out fast, but i'll be damned if I couldn't go to the local grocer and get a Family Size box of 12 for $6.99. Usually sliders are ground, formed and grilled in house. These tasted like White Castle.No sides to speak of with that price tag. The drink was $13 and with tip we spent $29 for 3 sliders and a drink. I'll hit up with Slidin' Thru next time.
5	**UPDATE** My wife and I ate here and everything was great! Our server Precilla was awesome. Extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and had awesome hair! We both wanted a quick bite to eat before Culinary Clash @ the Venetian started, and this place was perfect! We both ordered "The RattleCan" burger which was cooked to perfection! Definitely Top 3 burger i've had the privilege of stuffing in my face. Amazing! So juicy, and flavorful!Our waitress Precilla was always around making sure we had everything we needed. She also gave some great suggestions for beers,  and she was dead on correct. I got the light ale "Magic Hat #9" which was excellent! Easy to drink, light ale that went perfect with my burger. Went from my previous 4 star to a perfect 5 star. Keep it up Rattlecan. You guys are killing it in the burger game!
2	We located this brand new spot in LV a couple weeks ago whilst attempting to find a spot to have lunch. My brother and I were traipsing all over the Palazzo and I had decided to take him to lunch at First Food & Bar upstairs. Unfortunately some changes must have been made at First because they routed us downstairs to Rattlecan, stating that the menu was by the same chef and so would be similar. Well - yes and no. For starters, Rattlecan is kind of synonymous with everything that I hate about the cheesiest parts of Las Vegas. Garrish, loud decor spills out from around every corner and pops out of every wall. The Urban Daddy piece written about RC describes it as "This feels like a place where Axl Rose would have started a fight on the Appetite for Destruction tour," but my response to that is "Not hardly." For one the menu is priced way to high for anybody on the Appetite for Destruction tour. For too, I doubt Axl Rose would have ventured past the entrance to the restaurant after casting his eye inward. Anyway...the food, which is REALLY what this is about. We had the Pastrami Sandwich and Mini Wagyu Burgers. The Pastrami sandwich was very serviceable, along with the mini Wagyu sliders, although, I seriously doubt that the sliders were made with real Wagyu. Tasted like burger meat to me. Unfortunately I'm going to have to pass on this experience and I can't really recommend it to others. The food was decent, and the service was good too, but at the end of the day there are just tons and tons of better choices to be made in Las Vegas. At the price point these guys are charging you are better off venturing elsewhere, such as First Food & Bar or even a lower end steakhouse for their bar menu.
5	I'm sure by now you've probably heard about all the graffiti artists that contributed to the interior of the space, and if you haven't you can read about on their site. The restaurant is laid out with a pretty cool bar along one side decorated with old skateboard decks, some high top seating in the middle, and a few large private booths on the opposite side. There's also an outdoor patio with a great view of the fountains and strip, a large seating area in the back surrounded by neon and many TV screens, and even a mechanical pickle you can ride when you purchase their Rattlecan Pickleback shot. There's plenty to look at in here between all the artwork, carvings on the tables, attractive waitresses... it may be loud and a bit too much for some, but I found it to be very cool.Their menu is equally stacked: several burgers to choose from, hot dogs, salads, pickled items and a huge selection of beers and cocktails. We couldn't resist one of their appetizer items after reading it, their BBQ pork donut: crisp tempura BBQ pork stuffed roll, honey drizzle with a pickled jalapeno. It was sweet, crunchy and delicious. Their poutine also sounds amazing, and will be ordered on a future visit. After much deliberation I went with their namesake Rattlecan burger: custom house blend angus beef, cheese, bacon, caramelized onions, pickle, special sauce, and L/T on a sesame brioche roll. Upon first bite you can taste quality meat and excellent flavor. The patty had great char flavor, and was cooked close to medium rare but maybe a bit overdone. The bacon had amazing smoky flavor, the caramelized onions were really good, and my cheese was perfectly melted and very tasty too. There was just enough L/T and they were fresh as well. The bun was probably the star of the show; it was so dense yet flaky on the top, it was well proportioned and had just really great flavor. Although the picture may make this look like a whopper as some people have pointed out, it is worlds ahead of it and far superior. Easily one of the better burgers I've had this year.I got a pro tip from a friend that the crinkle-cut fries might be of the frozen variety and that I should go with the house-cut fries instead. Since this burger comes with crinkle-cut I was sure to make this adjustment in my order and I'm glad I did. The fries were great, which came as a welcome surprise considering the fries upstairs at First really took away from what could have been a strong burger meal on my last visit. These were cooked well with the skins on them; crispy and delicious without a lot of the bad oily flavor I refer to often. I'll note that I was initially charged the full $7 for the cost of house-cut fries on both burgers on my bill because of this swap, but our waitress not only had that removed, but also took off the supposed $2.50 fee that should have remained for this change. While there is a $1.50 difference between the two types of fries on the menu, I'm not sure I like the idea of having to pay more to swap these out. I almost always hate crinkle-cut, so I'm not cool with being forced to pick something else. Also, if I were to pay $7 for the small amount of house-cut fries as a side, I would be pretty pissed, even considering how good they were.Our entire meal with an appetizer, two burgers and two drinks came to a slightly steep $66.75. $12 for my small but tasty cocktail is a bit expensive, and I could probably do without the two small pork donuts for $11. My burger and fries were a very reasonable $16 given the strip location and just how good it was. If you can deal with just a burger meal with two waters or something this is very good food for the money, but it can easily creep up to an expensive burger outing if you're not careful. I'll also mention their gluten free bun option which I think is great; my girlfriend has been trying to stay gluten free but it isn't always easy when eating out around town. It's a .75 cent additional charge, but you get a very large, rosemary-flavored, good looking bun. It was very good compared to others I've had, but it's still not the same compared to a real bun, and certainly not the sesame brioche I had with mine. Also, Liz our server was super attentive and extremely friendly. All the wait staff seemed very attentive and fun, just like the restaurant itself. Rattlecan is certainly an amazing burger, and finally gives some other places in the property a run for their money.
2	Stopped in for a few drinks - Kick Flippin Breeze and a Strawberry Breeze. We were seated quickly on the patio as we requested, greeted quickly, and got our drinks quickly. However, after that we sat and sat and sat. I was starting to wonder if we were just going to have to dine-and-dash. I don't think I should have to wait a very long time or go hunt someone down just to pay.Second, the drinks... while good... may not have had alcohol in them. Either I'm just really an alcoholic or there was no liquor in either of my drinks.I don't give this often... but I'm going with 2 stars on this.
4	Cool vibe, excellent burgers and a nice craft beer list.
4	This is burger done right. Did the Burner burger. Actually spicy and the Ghostbuster sauce was hot too. GF did the Rattlecan and loved that one too. Come get some.
4	I found this place while walking around looking for something to eat. I love rock music and burger so I thought why not!I was sort of glad I did. Now before I go forward, it was new years day and after a long night I was not feeling good. Midway through my meal I really started to feel awful and started getting the chills. I left and went straight back to my hotel room and soon after I was running a fever.Now, back to the restaurant. I liked the setup of the place, and as soon as I walked in I was greeted by the sounds of the stones. I sat at the bar and just ordered a coke. I ordered a burger named after the place and it was good. But around the time I started eating, I started to feel bad. I had to take the bacon off. I did finish the burger and it was very good. But I asked for my check while I was still eating so as soon as I was done I ran out of there.I really did like the place and would definitely go back!
2	Sure, go ahead charge me a mandatory 20% gratuity without any mention (party of one), however, it's going to cost you my business. I refuse to eat anywhere with mandatory gratuity, especially with no disclosure. Gratuity is supposed to be a reflection of the service. Rattlecan's customers are going to find rapidly decaying service, after all, why try hard?  Also I generally tip 20% for good service but I believe the standard is still 15%. It's too bad because the lvs fries were pretty good. However when I ate during the nfl playoff game they had the sound blaring. During the commercials it was intolerably loud. I had to leave as quickly as possible, I couldn't take it. I only ate half my dish. Fail.
5	The busted meatball nachos were outstanding.  There were a totally different take on standard nachos.  The adult classic drinks are really good too.  Try the blueberry smash.  It's great.The outdoor patio is terrific.  Great view and atmosphere.  Super friendly.  Excellent service.
2	Turkey burger was pretty tasty with pepper jack and jalapenos, but chicken tenders had no flavor, neither salt and vinegar nor buffalo variety.  Biggest disappointment was pickled vegetable sampler which needed more curing time.  Pickle flavored chips were good if cut a bit too thick.
4	Let me start off by saying: the food is great, but the prices are SCARY.$14-$20/burger (no sides)$5/soft drink$5 for fries. $3 extra for a dipping sauce. Our bill:2 burgers, 1 side of green beans, 1 dessert = $52. OuchThe food is very good though. Burgers are prepared beautifully. Sides are well portioned. Juicy and pink meat! Take a shot of Jameson with a pickle juice chaser for $9.
3	Great, fun bar when you're in Vegas - incredible burgers and tons of good beer choices.  Started with the bacon wrapped shrimp poppers - fantastic dish!  Half of a jalapeno with a big shrimp tail placed inside and then the whole thing is wrapped in bacon and deep fried.  Fantastic variation on an old classic!  We also had the busted meatball nachos, an odd combination - sort of thick "cheesy" tortilla chips with crumbled meatballs, marinara sauce, and melted mozzarella.  Tasty but probably wouldn't order it again.  Moved on to the All City burger - a work of art! Very nicely cooked burger on a very nice pretzel bun topped with bacon, TWO kinds of cheese, and a fried onion ring ... are you kidding me?!Great place to hit, especially if you're milking a hang over from the night before.
5	THANKS to CHRISSY we have Great time.The food is very good. Burgers are prepared beautifully. Sides are well portioned. Juicy and pink meat! We in love with this place.The price is HI, BUT YOU ON VACATION....
5	Hmm...kind of no point in writing this review now since I have just been informed that they have closed its doors to business. =(Rattlecan was a great place for burgers, appetizers, and drinks. You can choose from a variety of toppings and dips for their fries/tater tots. It WAS located at the Venetian Hotel and Casino. I thought it was a good idea for them to have Rattlecan here on property because not everyone can afford $$$$$$ restaurants here at the Venetian. Besides Grand Lux Cafe, nothing else was really "within budget for an average tourist."My boyfriend got their signature Rattlecan burger while I got some burger with spicy sauce (forgot the name of it...sowwie!!) If anyone had Fuku Burger before, my burger tasted something like the spicy burger from Fuku. It was delish! I cut my burger in half and wanted to save the other half for lunch the next day, but it was so delicious that i HAD to eat the rest of it!!! =DI was DEFINITELY going to come back here again but now that it's closed....=( boo.
5	**CLOSED**Wish I ate here more!!! This place has one of the city's best burgers and poutine (fries, gravy and cheese) I had the Rattlecan Burger cooked medium rare to perfection with an egg! For all you Fatburger lovers out there...if thats good..this is great! I would eat here once a week if I could and tell all my friends about it!***** I ATE HERE MARCH 4th....HEARD THEY DID NOT OPEN AGAIN ON MARCH 5th! **** CLOSED!
