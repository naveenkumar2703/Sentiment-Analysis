3	Oh Taco Bell, what can I say about you?- Fast Service- Accurate Order- Decent tasting food- Smiling employeesWhat more can I ask for when all I want to do is not be hungry anymore?  A 7 Layer Burrito & Cheesy Bean Burrito hit the spot.Return Factor - 40%
3	I love Taco Bell. It's my fast food of choice. This location is like most other locations. It's the closest to my house, so I go here quite often. The service is always fast and friendly. The food is consistent. As much as I like Taco Bell, it's still Taco Bell so can't bring myself to give more than 3 stars.
3	Got the Doritos supreme tacos and a grilled wrap with a cherry limeade. The tacos were soggy and flavorless because of the sour cream. Next time, no sour cream. Grilled thing was so-so. Cherry limeade was tha bomb.
2	From the 9 years of living here, never have they ever screwed up my order. Until recently. I order regular tacos - they give me taco supremes. I order no potatoes in my double potato burrito - they give me potatoes. I get the double cantina CHICKEN quesadilla - they give me steak. I think the employees need to be less self centered & focus on their customer service.
1	Encharito was gross; it was a rolled burrito with ketchup sauce!7-layer was very small; I couldn't even see 7 layers, they were so cheap with the ingredients!Barfalicious!
