5	Located inside the Sola Salon in Henderson, ARae does a wonderful job mixing colors to get the right shades. She's fun to be around, has competitive pricing and uses Paul Mitchell products!  I drive across the valley for her excellent service.
5	I love getting my hair done by A-Rae.  I always feel 10 years younger.  She is truly a talented colorist!
5	Britny is awesome!  She is very knowledgable about hair coloring and knows just what to do to make you feel like a movie star.  She is very friendly and personable during the whole service and prices are very reasonable.  I have never ever been and felt anything less than wonderful every time I go.  The shop is very clean and convenient to a lot of places.  I will definitely go back!!
5	Meaghan is the best!!! I am very skeptical about my hair and have had a very hard time finding a stylist I could trust.... Until I met Meaghan !!! I came in with dark red hair (which is really hard to change) and she gave me the most beautiful blond, and dark brown highlights. And even gave my red a lot more color! She also cut my hair exactly how I asked and I couldn't be happier! Go to her salon because you will be coming back to her for a long time!:)
5	Imperfections is an ideal salon for those who are seeking a fashionable look at an affordable price. The girls here will be able to help you achieve the glamorous look you've been waiting for. Ask for Britny White. You won't be disappointed.
