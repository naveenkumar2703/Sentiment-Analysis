5	Burger was good. Fries were good.Soda was good.FROSTY was AMAZING.for a cheeseburger combo it is $5.95. To upgrade to large it's a dollar. Frosty's are $3 for a small. They don't charge you extra for BBQ sauce. This place saved my stomach (strangely enough) I was hungover and the burger and fries literally kept me from dry heaving. Thank you wendy's.
1	WOW- the prices almost made me pass out. I like Wendy's though, and I was hungry, so it had to do.  Enjoyable food, clean food court, but way too expensive to want to come back.
2	$10.58 for a medium-sized chicken sandwich meal. Not very good, but one of the few places open at 2am on a Wednesday night :-(
1	Terrible lol. Lady that Works in the night shift was terrible, doesn't know how to take orders,, just straight our mean! Lol
