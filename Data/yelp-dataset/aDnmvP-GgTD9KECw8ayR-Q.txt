5	This place is a hidden gem. A real diamond in the rough! I was cruising through town and saw this place and stopped on a whim. Little did I know I was going to be eating some of the best chili cheese fries I've ever had. I ordered the avocado bacon burger combo and got the chili cheese fry substitution. All I can say is awesome!! Seriously the burger was fantastic and I got so many fries I couldn't finish all of them. I'm going to hit this place up again!!!
1	New owner BAD BAD SERVICE AND BAD BURGERS.  Our office got 4 hamburgers and all of them were burned i don't mean over cooked I mean burned. I wish i could upload a picture. and while we waited 40 minutes even after we called in our order we still waited for the burned burgers. Not to mention the staff were screaming and yelling at each other.  When we asked for the manager come to find out that was one of the voices we could hear yelling.  IF YOU EAT HERE DON'T GET THE TAKE OUT THAT WAY YOU CAN COMPLAIN AND GET YOUR MONEY BACK WHILE YOU'RE THERE.  4 MONTHS AGO THE PLACE WAS GREAT. now it's just sad.
5	I acutely came here the first time cause I was in the area and looking for a new place to eat since the McDon down the street was closed. I found this place it had all good reviews except for one, that one was s new account with no friends and only one review. I figured it had to be a false hateful review but there was only one way to find out and that is to try it out. I am so glad I did food is great you know for a burger place.
