5	I went to the Tequila Festival with the BF and 2 friends and, honestly, it was pretty fantastic. We got our tickets through groupon, so it was not terribly expensive. With the ticket, you get 10 drink samples. I tried drinks from Canteen, Cruz tequila, and many others. We got enough alcohol to have a very good time. We also got to try food from the Sandbar (spicy mac and cheese...surprisingly delicious), El Reye de la Torta (always delish), Si Senor (Really good green chile...strong jalapeno flavor, but yummy), and America's Taco Shop (delish pork tacos). I had the added bonus of getting some Yelp sunglasses....fabulous! Overall, we had several hours of fun and entertainment and didn't have to stand in line for crazy amounts of time to do so. We also got to meet Xhibit...so that was....weird. I would go again next year.
5	So many types of Tequilla . I am going back next year I cant wait. Los of fun took a pic with Xzibit. good stuff.
4	SO MUCH FUN! Went with friends for this event and enjoyed the whole day! The different types of tequila were interesting (Cocoa Patron, nuff said) but the lines were a little long as the day wore on. Just glad that we went early and got done early because as we were winding down, some people were just starting to get crazy!I'll totally go back next year if friends want to go!
5	Good for the money, but a lot of the silver tequilas were not that good. Food was good, but there should have been more variety. Check out Dirty Tequila and Cruz Tequila for some good mixed drinks.
4	Can't find the Yelp table?? Great taste, love the new recipes for Tequila. Need more food vendors.
