4	I'm here at least once a week. The staff always greets customers when they walk in. I have never had a problem at this store. This is one of the smaller stores, so you have to get here early on Tuesdays when the new movies come out. I switched from Netflix to Blockbuster Total Access Premium because I can exchange the movies for more rentals in the store. They also give me 2 free movie or game rental coupons each month for just $17.99/month.
4	This place is always very calm and neat! The people greet you as you come in and have always chatted w me when I'm checking out. There's never a shortage of movies and if you ever need help finding one you can't remember the name of, the associates will help you find it.
3	CLOSED. They recently had their closeout sale and are now closed. :(
