4	The fry brad place we wanted to eat at was closed so we stopped at this place to eat before getting on the road back to san diego. Their menu has 11 combos, tacos , burritos and tortas. The meat options are carnitas, chicken , barbacoa, asada, pastor, lengua, and lengua. Oh, they also serve menudo, pozole , and tamales. We ordered the enchilada combo which included 4 (chicken or cheese), rice and beans. The tacos are small tortilla tacos. They have a salsa bar with salsas and condiments. Customer service was friendly and efficient. Food taste was good  The enchilada sauce was restaurant made, not canned like most places. Beans were very good and restaurant made, not canned. We ordered barbacoa(beef) tacos and the meat tasted great! No heavy seasoning or condiments. They sell american soda, mexican soda and freshly sqweezed lemonade. Ambiance was cool. Mexican music playing, simple tables with metal chairs. The place looked like its going through a make over. It had new orange paint on walls. Oh, they do have ceiling fans and a/c!
3	Don't go for the 50 cent tacos those are steamed tacos that while they might be good they are small and meatless. Instead try the assortment of tacos with meats or burritos. The menu is big with plenty to choose. And this place is very reasonable in price.
3	Not the best but they're OK.
4	So I didn't think i was going to like this place at all! I was convinced I was going to get food poisoning, and I couldn't believe that I had let my friend drag me here.. But it was sooo good! I had a Carne asada burrito and it was delicious and yummy! The rice and beans inside were perfect and not overly seasoned.. The only reason I wouldn't rate this sketchy place 5 stars is because, the horchata sucked, it was watered down and tasted very bland. Overall I had a great experience, just skip the crappy horchata.
