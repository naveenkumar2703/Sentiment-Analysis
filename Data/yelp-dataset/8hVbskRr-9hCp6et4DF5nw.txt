5	I always dread getting waxed, and since I moved to Las Vegas, I avoided finding a new place to get it done. However, my mom suggested I go to Ellen, and she was absolutely wonderful! She used an extra sensitive wax that was much less painful than usual waxing places. She did an incredibly thorough job and was so nice and friendly. Also! She is very reasonably priced and always very accommodating with appointment times.
5	One word can describe my experience with Ellen and that word would be 'professional'. I am not a fan of brazilian waxing, but Ellen makes the experience less painful.  The friendly atmosphere is very inviting. She is gentle and uses the wax that does not pull on the skin. My apointments are scheduled every 3-4 weeks, and she is very accommodating with your appointments and is willing to work with or around your schedule. If you want someone who is professional and caring and I recommend you make your appointment Ellen!
5	Ellen makes you feel relaxed and at home as soon as you walk in the door. She is a true professional at Brazilian waxing - thorough and fast. Also very affordable. I would definitely recommend Ellen if you need any type of waxing!
5	I got a deal online and did not regret going to European wax. Well, I do regret not buying another deal for later. Apparently, there was a small limit available according to Ellen. Whom, by the way had a great genteel manner with her approach to skin care!  I really enjoyed her sense of humor and candor. Hopefully after taxes, I can treat myself to another wonderful skin treatment!
