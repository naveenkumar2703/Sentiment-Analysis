5	I recently switched from Bank of America. I didn't know banking could be this easy and no fees!  I dealt with Rick Guillette who is the nicest guy in the world. He was very honest and informative. He made me feel very comfortable and even showed me how make 2% on my checking account. I also worked with Cassie Higgins who remembers my name every time I go in there. Very personal service. The way you always imagined your bank should treat you.
5	Now I remember how banking is supposed to be.  Extremely friendly staff is always helpful.  Feels like I am doing business with a neighbor instead of a corporation.  Beautiful facility with ultra convenient hours of operation.   I highly recommend Midfirst every chance I get.
5	MidFirst is a wonderful bank.  They are always friendly, open late during the week and on the weekends.  And if that isn't enough, any member can reserve a conference room at any MidFirst location for free.  Love this bank!
5	This review is long overdue!  As a former banker for 15 years, I am totally blown away by the level of service that this bank delivers.    We absolutely love the staff at this branch and their professionalism.  Other branches we have visited have also been outstanding with service.    As a bonus, MidFirst offers great options to not pay any fees and we can use any other bank's ATM's free of charge!    We have referred many friends, family members and clients and they all love this bank, especially this branch!
