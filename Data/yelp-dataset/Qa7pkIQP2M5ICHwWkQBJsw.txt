4	While there's no shortage of NAPA locations in the East Valley, this is probably my favorite. They've got friendly, knowledgeable staff and easily the best selection of in-stock products of all the locations.They're also open generous hours on Sunday, making this location one of the few NAPAs where you can get parts and advice seven days a week.
4	NAPA is always the best.  They have stuff that autozone and checker just don't carry... and very normally much cheaper than the dealers.Needed some cabin filters for the xterra today - they were the only guys in town that had em and for a great price too.  Autozone was twice the price and they had to order them.  Dealer was way over what I paid at NAPA...always will be back when I need stuff
4	The last few weeks I have been in and out of this Napa way too many times and Thankfully they are a helpful bunch. I'm not saying they are Head Mechanics... but they are knowledegable and can even help the women that walk in to the store that don't know what a Radiator Cap is. - The Customer Service is A-OK... Just depends on how lucky you are on who you get that day. - The Cleanliness of the Store is A-OK... Its an automotive store... It can't be spotless!- The Selection of In-Stock Parts & Other Vehicle needs it Awesome. They almost ALWAYS have what I need for my Truck in store & If not then its usually a 24 Hour Turn Around... How convenient is that! - Hours are AWESOME as well, 7 Days a Week... Hey Discount Tire you need to get on this ship & Join the Open 7 Days a Week, Yes Even Sunday Businesses! Keep up the good work guys... Will be in soon for more parts!
4	NAPA was the only one in town to have the electrical connector I was in need of. Some of the prices are on the high side, and like any other parts store here in the valley, they have at least one employee who has no clue if its not on the computer.
