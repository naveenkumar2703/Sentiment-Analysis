5	I just moved here from Illinois and looking for a new hair salon has been hard. I found Essentials on yelp and I am very pleased with my cut. Jen listened to what I wanted. Thanx Jen, great job. I will be back and bring my 3 girls for hair cuts.
5	my wife and I have been going to Essentials for quite a while now.   We love the place.  the staff are great and oh, the hair cuts are too!!
5	I'm new to the Madison area and thought my search for the perfect cut and highlight would be a long process, as usual.  I got it right on the first try!  Jen at essentials was fantastic.  She seemed to get what I wanted right away, and I walked out with perfect highlights and a great cut.  I'll definitely be back again and again!
5	I love Essentials. Holly has been cutting my hair and she does a great job, listens to what I ask for and is so friendly. It's a small salon, but it is really nice and you can tell they love what they do!
1	Called 10:30 am left a message, called several times during the still no answer. Finally got a call back at 4:15.  Then said they might be able to get me in in 13 days?This is not customer service.
5	I've gotten my hair cut here for the past year or so. Jen does a solid job and is super nice - she even taught me how to style my hair.
