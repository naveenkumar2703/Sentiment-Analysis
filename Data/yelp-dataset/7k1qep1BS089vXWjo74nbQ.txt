1	I would never have picked this company to come fix my Hayward pool pump, but fortunately the product was under warranty, but unfortunately had to be fixed by the authorized company, BB&G.BB&G did not know offhand if it was under warranty and took an entire week to find out and I had to call them to find out if they found out.  During my follow-up call, Mary put me on hold several times and for several minutes...actually, I was on hold longer than we actually spoke.Then all of a sudden, someone could come out in one hour and take down the model, serial number, etc. It took another call FROM ME about a week later for her to say the pump was in and schedule a time.  The serviceman does not show in the scheduled time window. I call Mary, livid, but she apologize for not telling the Serviceman the time window. Turns out the serviceman, shows up two hours after my time window,  not polite, fixed it, and eager to take my check for labor ($170 for 30 minutes),  In a rush to end his day, he almost (almost) refuse to let me see if it worked.  It works but not well.Such a poorly managed company.  I hope they go out of business.
1	Wow! I thought the review I read was stretching the truth but this is nuts! All I need is a simple repair for my pool, covered under warranty, and I've been stood up twice.
1	These people are clueless. I have confirmed multiple appointments over the phone. Only to get emails confirming completely different products than I had spoken about. Even to the point of denying I had an appointment over email but confirming on the phone. It's really scary that people like this are in business.  Stay away. And don't even think about calling them.
