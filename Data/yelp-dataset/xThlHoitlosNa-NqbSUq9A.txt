1	EL STINKO!So I went in here looking for a firearm that a website said they had but the gun was not in stock. I think they must order guns for people or something, but the pawn shop was lame and it smelled funny to. They hardly had any merchandise as well. Would not recommend this place since they had nothing and it smelled worse than a 50 year old Hodgie Mart!!!!!!!!!!
4	What a cool place to check out. It used to be a bank and now is a Pawn Shop. not very big, but they have some cool items.
5	We have been here a few times. Liberty is awesome! They always treat you very kindly and do all they can to help people. I won't go anywhere else. Liberty, thanks for being there!
5	Thank you Liberty Pawn! I was recently in a bind and needed some cash. The only thing I had of value was an Apple product - and I needed back the following week. I tried 2 places before finding Liberty. I went to a small private shop that held you to the 3 month term, not letting you pay in full early. Forget that. Then there is the famous Super Pawn...I hate them. Not only are they the most awkward people ever, they do not give you fair value for your item. Thankfully, I found Liberty. The staff was genuine, super friendly and honest. They take pride in their business and are very fair with their lending practices. If I'm ever in a bind again, I will definitely come back.
