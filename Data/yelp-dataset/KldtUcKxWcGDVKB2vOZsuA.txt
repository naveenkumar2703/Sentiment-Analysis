4	It is what it is, fast food and Wienerschnitzel.  Not my favorite but it is one of my husbands and hey, who doesn't like ice cream?  The counter people were very friendly and helpful.  The order was accurate and the restaurant clean.   Everything was hot and we had a sunday after that was yummy.  We returned tonight for an ice cream, again friendly, fast, effecient and accurate.  What more can you ask, if you are going to go to Wienerschnitzel.
4	Let's not rate food because it's a chain... it all tastes the same.  The staff here is friendly.  It's one of my favorite quick stops on the way to/from California.
3	Too bad they closed this location.
