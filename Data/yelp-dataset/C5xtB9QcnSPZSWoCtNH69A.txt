3	This store is IN Metrocenter Mall on the upper level.Overall 3.6-4 stars5 stars for selection, style, cuteness/sexyness. Major awesome points for sexy bras for cups over size C. It should NOT be as hard as it is to find a cute, fun, flirty, sexy bra when you have DD's. But it is... & it sucks.3 stars for prices. Yes, it's a brand. I understand this. But it almost hurts me to spend $40 on a bra. Luckily sometimes they can have some pretty good sales.I wasn't inundated by sales associates asking if they could help me. Thank you! Just let me look around. If I need your help I'll make sure to ask for it.Of course there are other things besides just bras here. Panties, shirts, shorts, nighties, lotions, & perfumes to name a few.
5	I came in on a weekday late afternoon since I had a coupon for a free panty and $10 off a bra. The salespeople were helpful and friendly but not pushy, which I really appreciated!! Usually it seems like Victoria's Secret sales associates are always trying to upsell and convince me to buy things I don't want, so this is now my favorite location, even though the mall it's in isn't super nice. The associates all appeared to be bilingual (spanish) also. I will definitely be back!
