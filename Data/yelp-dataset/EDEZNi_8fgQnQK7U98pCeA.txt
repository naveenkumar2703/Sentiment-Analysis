4	I must admit I have only ever been in for a pint, but no real fault can I find. If I were to be over critical, the renovations to the bar area have made it uber cool inside which doesn't hold with the building...but this is being critical for critical's sake and it will not stop me going back for a thirst quencher. Their beer garden out the front is a winner...even in the snow!
3	Was there last night for some after hockey refreshments.Have been many times over the years as well pre/post rugby at Murrayfield  and itsa  solid option as far as bars in that part of the city go. Good pints, good service, good seats and good screens!Cant fault it really for what it is other than the decor just feels a bit wrong!
5	I don't hand this out lightly.  This hotel was simply awesome...cool, fun, and clever.  Free scotch, marshmallow cookies, and awesome waters...TV behind the mirror, awesome showers, great location, charming, unique.Running out of synonyms...they just got it right...and I am a hotel consultant so I know when it was done right.  Congrats G1 on a job well done.
