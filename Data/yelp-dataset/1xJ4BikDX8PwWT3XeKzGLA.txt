5	Hibachi is normally related to Japanese name. however, I notice all the Asian worker speak Northern CHINESE. The place is very  clean - as expected - it is a new.the food: good selection, good salad bar, very reasonable price, fresh. it taste approximately equal to other Asian buffet. All good.
5	Uh.. oh...I error. the review is for the hibachi grill buffet, at 10030 n. metro parkway. my bad.
3	Good for fast food. Very similar to Panda Express with food choices and taste. Overall okay. Their potstickers are amazing though.
