4	The teachers at the CSN Nellis campus are very nice and laid back. The classes are eight weeks long and are not very difficult.
4	Ok, CSN classes on base is very nice for military. The instructors are very lenient/understanding of work/TDY's. The classes are excelled, so it's a lot of work in 8 weeks. I've taking five classes here now, and enjoyed everyone. Every instructor has been very nice, and knowledgable. The only down fall that I've encountered is the a/c sucks in the summer. Not that every building is like this on base, but all the class rooms are on the third story. Can put you to sleep. I recommend this for anyone wanting to get back in school, they really make things easy to get back in the swing of things.
3	Typical CSN bs. I really hate this "college"However, the campus on Nellis is really nice, and it's limited and 8  weeks per course is really great.
