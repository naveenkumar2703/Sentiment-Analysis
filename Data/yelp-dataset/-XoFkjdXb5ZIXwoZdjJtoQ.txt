4	I ordered delivery from a nearby hotel and was surprised at how polite the customer service was over the phone. They said my Works pizza and drinks would arrive in about 30-45 mins. Not 20 mins later they delivered my pizza perfectly hot and tasty! Keep up the good service!!
5	You know what you're getting when you order pizza from Papa Johns.  It'll never beat the better neopolitan/rustica kind of pizza at a real restaurant but it's quick, cheap, and sometimes you just want fast food pizza right??  I've had a couple of pies delivered from here and every time they come out really fresh.  Breadsticks were also hot out of the oven.  Not something you can say about every Papa Johns, so this one gets my vote of full confidence!
4	I order for Papa Johns all too frequently, and am almost always greeted by friendly delivery staff in less than my quoted time. If you use the PJ app or order online you can earn points towards free pizza. Got to love that!
2	This review totally bums me out!!!  My order was supposed to take 30-40 minutes and showed up an hour late, cold, was missing my extra pizza sauce that I ordered and the delivery guy was your saving grace!  He didn't have my Mt. Dew either and actually went to a convenience store to pick it up!!!  He apologized over and over about something he had no control over.  It wasn't his fault and he was a great representative of your company in a HORRIBLE situation.  If this order ends up being billed please expect a phone call from me because this is not at all what I was expecting.  Especially from Scottsdale!

5	This location does it. Nothing but positive experiences here. Huge fan! When I had trouble with an online order, they corrected it with ease. Their punctuality is on point!
