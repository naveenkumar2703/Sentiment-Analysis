4	top quality makes like adidias and nike and others.A bit expensive.Good staff that are always around.Good selection as foot locker sells shoes, hats,jackets and more.The staff are friendly and its a nice looking bright place.
4	Are you 16?Are you middle class?Are you white?Do you wish you were none of the above?If you've answered "yes" four times, then you'll love Foot Locker. Red PVC adidas high tops and basketball shirts will hide the horrifying truth of your privileged upbringing and race from your peers. Just don't let them see your dad's Volvo or mortgage deeds, or tell them about your family holiday in some poncey village in the south of France. That will really ruin your rep on the street.
3	Footlocker isn't that exciting, it stocks all the shoe brands you would expect to find in a trainer shop such as; Reebok, Nike, Adidas and a seemingly unnecessary amount of basketball sneakers. The prices are medium to expensive but they often have sales on where you can bag yourself a bargain but the sales usually only offer terrible looking shoes that nobody else wants.I guess Footlocker is more of a guys shop because whenever I've popped in they've had hundreds of guys shoes but a rather a measly amount of ladies ones so it's not somewhere I pop in that often. If I am looking for a new pair of trainers I will pop in to see what's on offer but more often than not I find myself going elsewhere.
3	footlocker has become somewhat of a staple item on Princes Street. The black and white bags are everywhere.  I don't really see the attraction personally, I find it quite boring really. But people love it!It's not bad, I mean, it's shoes!! You can't go wrong with it really. But don't come in here looking for a slammin pair of heels to match that dress, think trainers and black school shoes.
