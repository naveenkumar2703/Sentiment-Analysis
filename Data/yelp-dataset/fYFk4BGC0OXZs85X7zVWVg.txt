3	Three stars because the waitress was really nice.  However, this sports bar doesn't really measure up with some others I have been in.  At least it wasn't super crowded but would have been nice if they served food.
3	Their service was good. I wasn't all that impressed with their beer selection. Being from the Pacific Northwest, I have an abundant choice of breweries everywhere I go. They do sell pretty large beers for an alright price though! Naturally, its packed on game day but its a nice spot to sit & sip a beer if you are looking to relax for a few minutes.
1	extreme price gouging..1-tiny small Rum & Coke $13.58cents.  Watered down sewer water. Do people actually tip the bartenders at this rate???   its called ripping off the tourists. Wow...
4	I usually come here to bet and watch sports games. I like the atmosphere, fans are really getting into it. I also like the renovation they did with cushy sofa instead of the hard chairs. Unfortunately, the drink servers were too few to served the whole place, so it took awhile for our drinks to arrived.
