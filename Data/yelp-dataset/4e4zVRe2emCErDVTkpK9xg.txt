5	Awesome family owned business.  They always remember your name and little details about you, plus they do a great job.  Also, they'll box your shirts instead of using hangers which is the only way to go!
5	The best dry cleaners I have ever used. I have been to other laundry cleaners and no place can compete. Its family owned. They do a great job. I really like the owner. He always goes the extra mile for me. I travel a lot when I need clothes done in a rush they do their best to accommodate me. i used to go to Tatum cleaners, I thought they were friendly, but my clothes were not as nice.
5	Love this place. Clothes always turn out great. Really good at pressing
1	Took custom Kravel drapes in to be shortened.  Picked them up, hung them and they are grossly uneven and much shorter than the measursements specified.  Owner came out to collect them, fix them and rehang them.  I was on a business trip and came home to find them grossly uneven and shorter than the measurements specified.  Additionally, the backing is ridiculously short and can be seen to be as uneven as THREE inches in the span of 4 feet from one side to the other and are visible when the drapes are closed in the daytime.  Must have them repaired properly (if able). Can not recommend them unfortunately.
5	If it makes sense to love the dry cleaner, I love this dry cleaner!Over the years living in many areas of the country, I have found most dry cleaners to be little more than a factory with no regard for either the people or their clothes.The folks at Lone mountain are so gracious and always remember our names.  Their service is so professional, with our clothes never smelling like dry cleaning fluid.  They take special pride in getting out stubborn stains.I'd rather use Durell and clean my clothes at home until I found lone mt Cleaners.  Now it is a pleasure to have them cleaned professionally.
