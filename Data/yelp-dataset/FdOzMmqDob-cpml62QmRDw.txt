4	The food here is great! The pupusas are fresh and yummy, though I tend to load mine up with the salsa that comes on the side, as they're otherwise a bit bland.  There's an ample vegetarian selection (bean and cheese, zucchini and cheese, loroco and cheese)--all delicious!  Save room for dessert; the tres leches cake is absolute perfection (and sells out quickly, so cross your fingers that you can get it!)
5	I was visiting my boyfriend at Waterloo and was craving Salvadorian food.We had pupusas and I was pretty impressed even as a California native.
5	I've been coming to this hidden gem a couple of years now.  You always worry places like this may become too popular!  The papusas are fantastic!  The service is always warm and friendly (family run operation).  The tacos and nachos are also wonderful!  Tip - eat the tacos quickly l- the corn meal soft shells get soggy quickly!! :). No liquor license, but a nice variety of pop from Mexico as well as other beverages.
