5	Matt was awesome. They gave me the best quote for our 2014 Honda pilot. They were professional, knowledgeable,  and do awesome work. I made my appointment, dropped the Pilot off, and 2 1/2 hours later they were done! Im pleased with the work they did! Im sending all my peeps his way!
5	I love my tint!  Very professional and the price is definitely right. It also came with a warranty so even more so do I love this place. Very friendly and easy to talk to about picking out the right tint.  I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for great customer service and professional work.
5	I got my tint done on my Hyundai Elantra from this place about a month ago.  I got 20% in front and 15% in the rear windows.  I came in early on a Monday morning and the entire job was done in about an hour.  The tint was really clean, hardly noticed any bubbles as soon as I got it and it continued to get better as time went on.  The price was right in my range for what I wanted to spend and after doing my research at other places and considering the quality of film they use here, it's a great deal to get your tint done here.  Highly recommended!  Thanks Paradise Tint!
