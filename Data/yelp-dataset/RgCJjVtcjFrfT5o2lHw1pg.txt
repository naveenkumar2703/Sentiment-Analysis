2	I have been an arcadian resident, worker, and devoted reader for many years now  and was wondering when you are going to focus it on ARCADIA. Every restaurant review is out of "old town "scottsdale , the biltmore , or even farther north on scottsdale road. Have you ever thought of checking out some of the fine eateries we have in the neighborhood, most within walking distance to your home office on indian school rd. The wings at JTs?, the unbelievable lunch special at Mamma Mias 2 s huge slices and a soda for 3 buck, the awesome food at Elies deli, etc. Need I go on. This is the first letter of this kind i have ever written, but enough is enough. Why dont you change the name to "The Southwest Scottsdale/Southeast Paradise Valley/Northeast Biltmore News. It may be more fitting. For myself , i will stick to doing all of my spending of my hard earned money in the hood i live and love ARCADIA !! Wish you could say the say the same !! I know this will never make the editors page, but now its off my chestGood Day, Livin and Spending in ARCADIA
5	This is an excellent example of what is good about local newspapers. The Arcadia news has nice, exciting stories about real people in your area. It is not owned by a developer or other real estate professional, but an actual resident. I found that refreshing when I came in one day to talk to the editor. They are approachable, consider and they even give money to the local school and award a scholarship.A real paper with a purpose.
2	What happened to all of the coverage on the local sports?  The Arcadia News used to be very supportive and involved in Arcadia High School athletics.  No articles and only some pictures of some of the sports these days.  Shouldn't a local paper support its local high school?
