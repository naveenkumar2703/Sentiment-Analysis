The treats taste wonderful and are always beautiful and creative.  They are ready on time and everything is budget-friendly.  I would highly recommend ShortCakes for all of your pastry needs.

The cake was delicious and my boys loved the artwork.  They are very accommodating and flexible and the cake design is really amazing!  I would highly recommend them!!
