5	I have been a client with Entourage Fitness for a little over a year.  I love the trainers and the atmosphere at Entourage.  I love that it is a small gym with varied workouts to keep you motivated.  All of the trainers are very knowledgable and truly care about each clients success.  My fav workouts:  Suspension, RAGE and BOSU!!
5	Friendly gym! Great selection of classes. You never get bored! Each class is a 30 min session, different every day and lots of fun! Try the TRX full body, you'll use muscles you never knew you had!
5	I'm a freelance personal trainer, train clients in home, and generally work out at home because trainers at gyms I've worked out at in the past have had a tendency to be very pretentious and condescending.  Not here!  Lacy and Tyler were super friendly and know their stuff!  The TRX system was a great alternative to my usual workout routine!  Will definitely be back!
5	I've been going to large chain gyms for years now and was getting bored with the same old workouts every week. I decided to check out Entourage and was immediately hooked! I love that the classes are different from week to week. I never get bored and actually look forward to my workouts! The atmosphere is very inviting. The instructors are awesome! Always motivating you to get to the next level. The members are all friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend you check them out!
5	Quality quality quality good people good trainers I just wish they bring back the rain each class loved it
