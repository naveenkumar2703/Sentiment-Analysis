5	I took my daughter (2.5) to Edward's Salon for her first haircut, despite being very unsure about cutting her hair at all! The staff were wonderful and calmed all my fears right away. The hairdresser (who specializes in children's cuts) knew exactly what to do to keep my daughter interested and cooperative - I just sat back and she took care of everything. She even saved the "first lock" in a little baggie without me asking. I was expecting some distress or even a tantrum, but my daughter was so intrigued that she sat perfectly in the little "fire engine" and smiled even when having the tangles brushed out!My only complaint about this salon is that their credit card machine does not allow you to add a tip - and you will want to tip generously because they do such a great job. Bring some cash or stop at the ATM in Sentry Hilldale beforehand.

1	I went to Edward's Salon for a perm on my one length shoulder length hair and what I got is the worst unattractive dated hairstyle.  Ruth Ann who did it showed me a picture on the shampoo room wall and said this would be nice so I asked if she was sure she could achieve the cut and she said "yes".  The first cut of my hair came to the bottom of my ear!  No going back but she assured me it would be fine and I will like it.  It is nothing like the picture, she gave me SHORT BANGS and she cut  off the perm she had just done.  Ruth Ann said at the end "give it time you will like it".  I don't have a choice now or did I after she the first cut was at ear length.  This is the worst hairstyle and it can't be corrected because there isn't any length.  Nothing like being at the mercy of a beautician after the first cut.
