4	I never learnt the bagpipes, but if you have then Kilberry Bagpipes is an excellent place to come for piping supplies or a whole new set of pipes.  The guys inside are friendly and definitely seem to know what they're talking about with regards to pipes, drums and learning the instruments.  They also sell tuition books and CDs for those who wish to learn to play the pipes or drums.  I had a look through one of the books and it's pretty in depth stuff.  Apparantly playing the bagpipes can improve cardiovascular strength and fitness as well as coordination.  These are worth while instruments to learn and Kilberry Bagpipes is a great place to come and find out more.
