4	I was in Phoenix for work and came in from  the Bay Area.  I saw a flier at the Fair Trade Cafe and thought I should check it out since it was close to my job location. This is a great new yoga spot in downtown Phoenix.  I showed up for a 4:30p vinyasa flow class with Reed who was kind, knowledgeable, and friendly.   Normally vinyasa yoga tires me out, but Reed gave great modifications and also explained health benefits of many poses.  I came out feeling refreshed, limber, and ready to handle my evening work.  Location was convenient, parking was easy, and most importantly I got a great workout.  It's new and donation-based, which is so important because it makes yoga accessible to folks from all income levels.
5	I have never done yoga in my life, but was completely welcomed by the instructor and fellow students!Because this first time, I have no idea whether or not it was good by comparison to other classes, but I had a very fun time. It was much more strenuous and soothing than I could even imagine and I felt it was a steal for $12.That said, the yoga is free (suggested 10 dollar donation) and welcomes all levels of flexibility an experience. There is also a $2 rental fee for the yoga mat, but you can also bring your own.If you live in and around Tempe, yoga and this place are worth a try. I hope to see you there soon!
