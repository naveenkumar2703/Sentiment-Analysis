4	I used to come here all the time when I worked nearby.  Well I am back and nothing has changed but the menu.  They still gave my favorite gyro platter for lunch special.  I had the gyro sandwich it was very good VERY good.  Went back a few days later for the Gyro Platter and its exactly how i remember it.  Going back next weekend or the one after with the family to see how good it is for bringing Children
4	Whenever I am in the Phoenix area, I make sure this is one of my first places to eat.  The food is phenomenal and the service is nice and friendly.  They have a nice outdoor patio and plenty of seating inside as well.  Prices are reasonable and they have a variety of menu items.  The decor is a bit lacking but that doesn't make it or break it for me.
1	The restaurant itself smelled like sewer- probably why there is a patio. Husband and I were ignored by the female behind the bar for several minutes, after seating ourselves,while she talked on the phone. A girl who came on shift actually helped us before bar lady hung up...but they proceeded to gossip, loudly, and serve themselves drinks before us. I had to get up to ask for service and to check on our food that I had watched sit there for at least 10 minutes. We were the only couple there, and they acted like we were a chore. Service was so bad, the food got cold. Suprised the place is still in business. Never going back, don't recommend. I'd give negative stars if I could.
5	i eat here all the time. i called to check the hours, no answer. are they closed? please reply,anybody!  im hearthbroken. lol.
