3	It's a Taco Bell and Pizza Hut Express combo, what more could you really ask for?!
5	Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.  My bassett hound got out of my yard down the street from taco bell and they were very nice to take my business card and let me know if he by chance would show up there...got home after going through the window and sans de bassett, patron saint of speed bumps was wandering up the drive way into my yard....called taco bell to thank them for caring.  And I got a sweet burro to boot!
1	Horrible!  Dirty, run down, the employees didn't know their butt from.....well you know.  The taco meat had NO flavor. I told the kid behind the counter and he just looked at us with his mouth hanging open and shrugged his shoulders.  There were flies everywhere. The floors were dirty.  Both restrooms were filthy ( and for my husband to say a men's bathroom is bad, it has to be bad). Never, ever have I had such an icky taco bell experience.  Will go back to stoping at Carl's jr or jack in the box on the way thru town.  Icky. Just icky.
5	Ok, I know.. 5 stars???? But for a Taco Bell, this place rocks on multiple (all) levels - helpful suggestions in ordering ( who WAS that server?) , quick food service, very tasty eats.  For long haul large family travellers (two cars), this will be pitstop going forward.
