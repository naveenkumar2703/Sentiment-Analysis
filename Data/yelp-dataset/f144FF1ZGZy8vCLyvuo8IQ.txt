3	If you're wanting a relatively cheap and satisfying Indian take-away meal, Clerk Street is the place to go. However, Roti Restaurant is in whole other league.It's a successful attempt at fusing quality Scottish ingredients with Indian recipes. The menu has the usual dishes you would expect at an Indian restaurant, but if you take a closer look you'll see they've tried to make them more unique (also what I call trying to justify the prices). For example it's possible to have haggis samosas, salmon filled naan (defininitely a first) and for dessert Indian carrot cake! The main dish menu is a little bit more traditional and doesn't stray too much from curries.The tiffin for a tenner option seems pretty cool; it's basically tins filled with different foods, and there are vegetarian, meat and fish options. The decor is quite fancy and contemporary, making it nice for a special night out.
