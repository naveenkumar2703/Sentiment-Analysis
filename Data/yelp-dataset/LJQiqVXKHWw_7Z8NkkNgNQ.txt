5	Andrea is the best trainer!  My husband and I have been working out with her for 3 years.  She is very knowledgeable and SUPER motivating...even when I'm not so motivated!  She takes a holistic approach to nutrition, which is what I wanted, and  she varies our training routine so that it is never boring.  We do strength training, as well as functional training to keep us fit for the long-haul!  We workout in local parks, our house, the gym in our condo building, wherever is most convenient and depending on the weather.  Thanks Andrea!

She really cares about you and designs workouts specific to your body type. Her personality and enthusiasm make even the toughest workouts fun. She is the best trainer I have worked with. She deserves more than 5 stars.
