4	No nonsense barber shop.  Plenty of periodicals, and you won't spend more than 10-15 minutes in the chair.  Discounts for military as well.  Your best bet is probably just to show up, there's no reason to call ahead.
5	This barber shop is fast, cheap, and has a very old school and quaint atmosphere.  Nice barber as well, nice to talk with.Great place for mens haircuts! 10 mins in chair, perfect clean cut, and great rates. Only $15
5	I have been "shopping" around for barbers that are locally owned and operated. I have found my new home to get my hair cuts. Wayne's is a small business and very laid back atmosphere. I certainly recommend anyone to visit this barber out for their next haircut and give him a try you won't be disappointed.
