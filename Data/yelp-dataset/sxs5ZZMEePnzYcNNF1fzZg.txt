1	I took my car here to fix my manual clutch, but decided to have someone else fix it after being quoted $1000 less from another shop. The customer service here is HORRIBLE and the people are extremely rude...so rude that I would have paid more to have it fixed somewhere else just to avoid being talked down to.
5	i have been dealing with these guys for years, and will continue to do so. Ron the owner is a straight shooter. as i said i have been doing business with him for years, and he and his crew have never once lied, or tried to overcharge me. i can even think of a few times where they saved me quite a bit if money.
5	took my van here bc i was quoted almost 3 k to fix a transmission in the van...turns out it was just a bad input sensor and they fixed it and it only costed me 200 bucks.  Then, he changed the oil for free....go see Mike at this location.
