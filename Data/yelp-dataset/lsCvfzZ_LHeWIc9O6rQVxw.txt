3	I use to live around the corner from this place.  This was my 'Go To' gas station/convenience store.  Since I moved away 3 yrs ago, I rarely stop by.  However, I was in the area and needed gas, so I stopped here for a quick fill.  Here are some of the reasons I like this place:- The pumps are in good condition and the price of gas was competitive.  It's well lit so it's pretty safe/comfortable for nighttime fillups.  - I like how spacious the gas pumps are here......I hate gas stations that are so tight you can't fit a car between the cars filling up.- There's a water & compressed air unit here.  It's amazing how many gas stations don't have that anymore.Return Factor - 30%....would be higher if I lived nearby.
4	i love love love their chicken fingers! best chicken fingers so far.. i also really like their tacos. simple but really good. you wouldnt expect gas station to have good food so definitely check this place out.
5	Who knew right? I've been going here for years hands down the best chicken wings in Vegas.. Truely a hidden gem.  Not only are they divine but cheap, you cant beat that with a stick! I have eaten a whole pound all by myself. I always get spicy and ask for more heat they are the best that way
1	Not a fan of the over night cook at the stop and shop. He was very rude and antagonizing. He also burns the chicken which makes it really hard instead of the normal day cook that makes it really good!! This place is so convenient and close and also always open but I dont think i will be returning to this location over night. I may give them another shot in the day time if I am really hungry or just craving wingsand I dont feel like driving. But they need to seriously reconsider their employees
