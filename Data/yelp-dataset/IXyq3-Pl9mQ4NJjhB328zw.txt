3	This is an Arco - AM/PM Mart as well. I have never actually gotten gas here so I couldn't tell you whether you should or not (but gas is gas so I'm assuming its not bad). But I do eat food from the AM/PM Mini Mart here all the time. For the hot food prices you really can't get a much better deal. They have Hot Dogs, Burgers, Corn Dogs, Chicken Sandwiches, BBQ Rib Sandwiches, Pizzas and Burritos. Prices for these generally range from 79cents to $1.99. No complaints there. I haven't gotten sick from the food yet so I'm assuming its not that terrible.Generally I go here because I work for a company that works at Luxor but does not have access to Luxors EDR (Employee Dining Room). Not a bad deal for the hot-stuff but the regular stuff is a bit overpriced from other gas stations but this is on the strip across the street from Luxor so what do you expect?Not a bad stop for a quick and really cheap hot sandwich. Just don't expect the people at the counter to be friendly (at least during the day).
1	Really should be a 0 star because the guy at the counter pissed off my boyfriend for no good reason! Terrible service! Not a good way to start off our drive back home.But Arco gas is cheap. But still that doesn't make up for terrible service! lol

3	when it comes to vegas gas prices..you know you got a deal. Cheap gas prices at this location as of yesterday 1/8/12 at $3.27 per gallon, not bad.
