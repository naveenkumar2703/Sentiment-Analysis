5	If you are looking for the best wraps and graphics look no further you have to use Cortez
5	We have had a few vehicles wrapped for our tinting business and finally found our wrap company. We have tried some of the random wrap companies and even one of the huge local companies. Nobody does it like Cortez Visual Communication. The process is smooth, the designers are second to none, and the install absolutely perfect.  They use all 3M vinyl and the colors on our new wraps pop. I highly recommend this company to anyone wanting it some right.
5	The entire experience that I had with Cortez Visual Communications was OUTSTANDING!!  I was amazed at how they were able to take a vision, revise it to make it better and then allow it to come to fruition in an amazing vehicle wrap.  Everyone that I worked with at Cortez (from the receptionist, the sales staff, the designers, and the installation staff) was extremely easy to work with and very professional.  If you want the best in all aspects of a vehicle wrap, go with Cortez.
5	This place is fantastic.  Not only do they keep you in the loop with all of the steps of getting a vehicle wrapped, but everyone you talk to sounds like they are the owner of Cortez Visual Communications.  Ric, sales guy, Kevin, design/installation guy, McKenna, designer and Steve, the owner are all very professional and guided me through each and every step of the process.  They went above and beyond my expectations.  Now for the wrap on my truck, I couldn't be happier.  The design is fantastic and my truck looks awesome.  If you are a small business owner and want to make your company look professional, have these guys work their magic.  My 2nd truck is going in next month to get wrapped.  I wouldn't go anywhere else.  Thanks guys.
5	If you need a car wrap try Cortez Visual  good work and they care about you that's hard to find!!! Thanks again Jason.
