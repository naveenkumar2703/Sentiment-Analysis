1	I'm not a big fried chicken fan and I have not been to a KFC in years.  I kept seeing all these ads for how KFC has changed.  They lowered the prices and now have supposed grilled chicken.  NOPE, still awful.  I got a box meal and it was cold.  I ordered a bowl for my husband and they charged me for something else, which was more money.  No sorry or a refund.  I won't be back.
3	This was one of those nights when we just didn't have time to make dinner so we opted for the lazy way out and hit the drive-thru. Given that it was just before midnight, we tried to remain optimistic about what might be left in stock. One of the two "Famous Bowls" seemed more like the washed up, haggard version of famous, given that the bowl was barely half full. The remainder of our order wasn't horrible, but it wasn't fabulous either. On the bright side, the employee at the window was very good! He was friendly and speedy!
1	Horrible service.  Rude individuals.  They locked the doors before the business was closed so they wouldn't have to deal with complaints!
