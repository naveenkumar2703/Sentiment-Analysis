3	I used to come here all the time back in 2004 to get all my Dickie clothing needs. I just came from here today (11/10/10) and they don't have much selection anymore =( they used to have almost every color in Dickies but now they just have basic colors, black, blue, tan, gray, white.  What they do have is a huge selection of worker boots. The employees are a bit weird and they hound you like you're about to steal something. Or maybe they're just really that helpful.
5	Excellent service. Very knowledgeable staff. They have a great selection of work boots and apparel. One stop shop! Highly recommend.
4	Pretty good plus size selection & super helpful on products and availability in those plus size work clothes.  I highly recommend this place.  A plus on service!  Offered us so many options for future purchases on how to save by having items shipped from their store to one closer to where we live.   We will be back there
4	10% discount for being in the union. Not too shabby. Good selection of shoes for the working man.
1	Use to buy all my work boots here. Not any more. Wanted a specific pair of boots. Didnt have my size. Tried to push 6 other pairs of garbage boots before telling me their other store had them. Ordered transfer which took a week. Drove to store and the boots weren't there and no one called. Girl was rude especially when I asked why there prices were hiher in the store than online and in their flier. I bought the same boots from Amazon for $50 less and recieved them in 24 hours.  They lost a customer because of lack of customer service, high prices and lack of adequate inventory.
5	Needed coveralls for last minute Halloween costume and staff was very helpful and let me know they had item I was looking for over the phone. They even held it for me at the front of the store so I was in and out in under 5 min!!! Great customer service!!!
