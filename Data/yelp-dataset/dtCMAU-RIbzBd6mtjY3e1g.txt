3	The prices are pretty reasonable and the fashions are super cute. But don't expect a great quality.  For younger crowds. We met one of the owners an she is super nice. Happy to support small businesses.
3	They have some cute stuff, it's not too expensive but the quality is not so good. I didn't see recognizable brands but what do you expect? There isn't a huge selection but it's all displayed nicely.  I get my lashes done next door at Axiom Spa and I always hear their music through the walls. It seemed that Hidden Attic was a fun party place so I decided to check it out. I was really annoyed with the loud hip hop/rap music. The use one of those mega base portable boom boxes. It was obnoxious.  I was not interested in buying or browsing too long and lost interest. I would love to spend more time browsing but I'm not 21 and at the club. I think this place has potential.  Get a bit more stock.Be more friendly to your potential customers. Turn down your music. Avoid rap and stick with top 40 music.
5	Super cute stuff! Affordable prices. Staff is really nice and friendly. Offered to help me as I walked in the door. LOVE this store!  Definitely coming back.
