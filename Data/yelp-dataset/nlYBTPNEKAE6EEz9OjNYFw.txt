1	Horrible customer service, no way to make an appointment for pickup or adjustments. You are at the mercy of a first come first serve basis. Reps are very rude, definitely better to go to an eye doctor where they can just order the frames/lenses for you and when you pick them up you can actually set up an appointment. Would never recommend this place. name of the rep who basically blew off a guy who had been in multiple times and waited was Hans-Retail Manager.
5	Great service and incredibly helpful. An employee by the name of Scott helped us immensely by repairing and adjusting my boyfriend's glasses with no charge! It was fast easy and convenient.  Scott was very nice and professional. Will come back again for a pair for sure thanks again Scott. This is for the Lenscrafters inside Superstition Mall by the way.
5	I have been very happy with the service at this location. I brought in my glasses that I had bought at the Scottsdale location and they were not comfortable and making a mark on my nose. The guy replaced the nose pads at no charge with newer silicone ones that he said would be much more comfortable and they were! He was very friendly, fast and helpful when he didn't have to be. They don't carry a lot of brands at this location but they do have great sales if you don't have vision insurance and have to pay out of pocket for your glasses like I do. I have always been very happy with them.
