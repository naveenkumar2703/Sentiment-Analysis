4	Aside from stocking all the equipment any serious mountaineer could need, the more modest traveller can opt for a top quality winter coat for any occasion. The selection of North Face jackets here are more then enough to see you through Edinburgh's cruel winters. Of course, expect to pay a hefty price for such technical attire but no doubt it will last you many a winter month.Occasionally, however, you may spot a bargain on some of the single layered undergarments, ideal pre-ski trip.
5	I came in here a little bit bright eyed looking for a present for my dad. He was going skiing the next day and it was his birthday....what's a gal to do?! So I asked a few really friendly sales people and was directed up some stairs to find myself in snow sports heaven. I must have looked as confused as I was, because within a few minutes I was getting help from one of the sales advisors,she was lovely! We managed to pick out things that my Dad would use and he loved themIf I ever go skiing I'm definitely coming here, they are so lovely!
5	Great shop, full to the rafters with every adventuring item you could ever think of. There are three floors packed with goodies. Must say that on my last visit I was particularly impressed with the staff. We kept one guy busy for over half an hour, asking questions, trying stuff on, getting advice... He was lovely, helpful and extremely knowledgeable. This has always been my first port of call for outdoor gear, and I won't be changing my mind any time soon! :) Sure, you can probably find gear cheaper online, but the advice and help from the guys at Tiso is worth the internet savings. Go here for more than the gear.
