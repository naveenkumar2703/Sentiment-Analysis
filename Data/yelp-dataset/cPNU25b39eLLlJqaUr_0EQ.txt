3	This is an overlooked but quality Chinese quite close to Haymarket. Their customer base has suffered due to the horrendous tram works unfortunately so I'm writing this to remind everyone it's still there! China Town used to be based up in Newington for many years and was my favourite lunch place ever when I worked over that way (I was kinda glad when they moved as I got quite fat!). The lady owner is really friendly and welcoming and remembers every face that used to come to her old place. I'm giving it 3 stars as the service is friendly, it's a great place to come post rugby in larger groups, I often get a takeaway on my way to the train station (mega speedy) and the food really tasty. They are happy to make anything off menu too including my favourite chicken and beansprouts. The wine selection is pretty good too. Can't beat a Chinese restaurant that sells a good Chablis!
