5	Rachael is the best hair dresser I have ever had, hands down! She does my hair, most of my friends' hair, and all of our kids. She is AMAZING! I have been seeing her for over 2 years now and would never consider going anywhere else. She has become family. :)
5	My hair truly loves her!!! She did my hair exactly how I like it!! I felt like a million bucks and her prices are a steal!! She also just did my 12 year old daughters hair, she did an awesome job, my daughter has really thick curly and has a tender head, not one shed tear!! This is more than 5 stars
5	Rachael was understanding of my goal for my hair. I came in with drab and dull looking hair and left with the perfect cut and color! She did an amazing job with great conversation to boot. I will go back everytime! I have found the stylist for me.
5	New in town and need a place to get your hair done? Rachel is your hair dresser! I have lived in Arizona for two years and haven't had my hair done yet. I guess you can say I have a "new hair stylist phobia". I walked in, sweaty palms, sick to my stomach (yes, it's that bad). First thing I noticed is that it's a cute, clean little salon. The other stylists were friendly and Rachel is super friendly. She seems very down to earth and knew exactly what I wanted with my hair. I even brought photos in of my wedding to try and explain what I wanted. She had it down to a tee. I'm very happy and will definitely go back in a couple months. I've had a ton of complements and it's so nice having my hair done again. Thanks!(Also, the address on this Yelp page is wrong, she is located at El Mirage and Bell)
5	rachel is awesome!!!!
