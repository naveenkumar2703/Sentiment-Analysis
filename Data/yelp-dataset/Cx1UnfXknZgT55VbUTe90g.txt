4	My coworker told me about this new liquor store right around the corner from my house. I wasted no time in checking it out.They have a decent craft beer selection. Actually, it's quite good. I was just hoping for more. In the corner of their fridge setup, there is this "beer cave" entrance. I got excited, thinking they had a treasure trove of hard-to-find brews inside. I was disappointed to find out it was just cases of the macro stuff.On the bright side, I picked up a bottle of the latest Game of Thrones beer. I didn't even realize they made a new one. Another bottle for my collection!
5	Excellent knowledgeable staff, clean and great savings.  You can get rare and special beers my husband can't find elsewhere.  The prices are reasonable. The store is very easy to navigate.
4	For anyone living in the Mountains Edge/Blue Diamond area, this is a great location to pick up anything you may need to "wet 'yer whistle" when I last went to a house party I was in charge of bringing the mixers and Bevmos were closed and there's not really juice options at gas stations so I found this gem. Wide selection of wines, beers, premixed, along with snacks.
4	Only talk to the people who own the place or are related to the owners! I called today, asked for a specific wine from a specific region , I went to pick it up and it was the right wine maker from the wrong region !!!! I've never had a problem at this store except for today!Today this place lost one star because this particular employee wasted my time, even after I called and asked for a specific wine and gave specific details! This person is nothing more than a cashier and has no product knowledge and shouldn't be allowed to answer the phone ever!!!
