5	i have gone to this store half a dozen times, and i have never left unsatisfied. the ladies that work there LOVE their job and you can tell. they always help me with whatever project i'm working on. i walk in and they always greet me and ask me if i want help [which i always do!] and they ask me what kind of project i'm working on and will help me with everything from the paper, to stickers to how i should position my pictures. they even have a dicut station, and you can use all their equipment for $3 an hour. which i think is a GREAT deal. i'm actually not a scrapbooker. i don't own a scrapbook. but i LOVE this kind of stuff. i'd rather do a bunch of small projects then a huge scrapbook. i also secretly love pretty paper [ i guess it's not a secret anymore]this is a scrapbookers paradise! and also wanna be scrapbookers that doesn't know how to do anything. [like me!]locally owned which is a plus!
