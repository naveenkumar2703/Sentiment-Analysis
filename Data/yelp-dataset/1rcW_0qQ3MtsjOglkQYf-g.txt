3	Rox is in a bit of a random spot.  It's located on a street parallel to I-15 (Dean Martin Dr.) and next to a cheap hotel.  This place is popular with the bikers.  You'll see all sorts of hogs parked right in front.  I've been to Rox a few times, mostly on Friday/Saturday nights and there is always a live band playing.  More often than not, it's a cover band.  And almost always it's a cover band featuring huge southern looking dudes.  The bikers love it.  The place is kinda small to be housing a live band.  It gets super loud and makes it virtually impossible to talk with friends.Rox is a bar.  That's it, no food.  There is the main bar on the ground floor.  There's also a group party area on a loft overlooking all the action.  The pricing is about average for Vegas.  5 or 6 bucks for a beer.  8 bucks or so for a shot and/or mixed drink.  The bartenders are usually very hot women.  The upper level also has a pole for when your female friends get a little tipsy.  Rox is a fun, no frills place, but the overwhelmingly loud live music is a buzzkill.
3	More like a smaller lounge with an oval shape inside. Looks like it could comfortably fit a few hundred people. One of the few Vegas Strip nightclubs that actually has bench seating for people, around the oval shape of the dance floor. I attended a PubCon event here, which allowed us with badges to get in early and stay until the nightclub opened at the regular time. Only one thing about sitting in one place too long, they use a lot of fake smoke and so this can get a little annoying on the edges of the nightclub.
2	the music they play is pretty good...but this place is tiny!
