5	This is a place to go for that hard-to-find, great-tasting Thrifty ice cream!!  Many flavors to choose from.  Also, be sure to stop by on Friday or Saturday for some amazing BBQ and other items that are excellent!  This is a family-owned business and the owner is very friendly.  Give them a try!
4	This is a friendly, hard working, family owned store. I don't normally have much need for water or ice, so I never went to their store. But I recently discovered that they serve BBQ on the weekends. Who would of guessed that? She could use better signage but hopefully the word will get out. It is really good food! The menu changes weekly, but so far everything I've tried has been really good. Right down to her homemade BBQ sauce and cornbread. A must try. If you're a local, you'll be familiar with the hard to find Thrifty ice cream. Tons of flavors.
5	We checked out this place at the request of friends and they had amazing BBQ, I personally got the brisket, mac n cheese and cornbread.  My food was hot and amazing when my to go bag was delivered, the two friends I had with me had the BBQ chicken and Ribs, with the mac n cheese and greens, both friends commented on how good their food was, so we are giving a local, family owned Water and Ice shop 5 stars!  Way to go Mary and keep up the amazing BBQ menu, we will be back!
4	Great little place with a little bit of everything.  Went at the suggestion of friends for some weekend BBQ and all I can say is WOW!  Great BBQ chicken and the mac and cheese was heavenly.  Broke the diet but it was so worth it!  Oh, and they have Thrifty Ice Cream, too.  'Nuf said!
