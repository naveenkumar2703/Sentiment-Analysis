4	Well, I always go here for hats.Mostly for dance shows and the occasional crazy hat day. great service.
4	I love coming to this store.  I've been coming to this store since they opened this mall in the mid-90's.  Over the years, I've bought Kangols, rider caps, cowboy hats, and other fun hats.  Most recently I stopped here to browse their selection while Christmas shopping.  I found Santa Hats for $6.95, so I bought one for my Son and I....then bought a pink one for The Better Half.As a bonus, the staff here is always friendly and helpful.Will I return?  Of course!
5	Awesome fedora selection and customer service by David! They can modify hats to fit your head better with inserts to make the hat fit perfectly on your head. Didn't know that until now. Also able to put a feather in there if your want. Reasonably priced to at $20-$40 for quality made hats. Highly recommend this place if you're into hats other than baseball caps.
4	This is a cool niche store for hats! You can find just about any kind of hat here possible, from fedora's to beanies, spirit hoods and costume type headwear. I always find cool stuff here!
