5	I am a VIP here! For every 100 Dollars Spent you get 10 Cents off per gallon of gas at any Frys gas station.
2	I don't like this store.  The manager was condisending to me once because I brought a propane container into the store to be filled.  I'm 32, not a 6 year old kindergardener.There produces IS good and there is a good selection.  Decent prices on booze too.  Their meats are poor at best.  I only come here when Albertson's, across the street, is out of something.
4	Hit up the deli bar and reward yourself with Starbucks.
5	I love this store! The staff is super friendly and helpful. No lines ever. Produce is always fresh. My kids love to go to the kids corner so my shopping trips are a pleasure always. I even hit up Starbucks sometimes before I start! Can't ask for anything better than that!
