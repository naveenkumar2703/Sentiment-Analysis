5	I have taken a few suits here and have had great service every time. I love the drive-thru service and their staff is quick and friendly.I have found their prices to be reasonable.
1	I had a $150 shirt cleaned here and it came back with oil on it. Sent it again and it came back with the oil AND black marks all down the front of it.  Left message with owner and he never called. I called him about a month later and was told to drop it off, so I did about a week ago, and have heard nothing. Customer service is terrible. I would be surprised if this ever got resolved. On top of it, the staff has been INCREDIBLY RUDE to me on several occassions. 2nd note:  stopped by today, July 30.  Staff was rude,as usual, and told me they have no idea when somebody can help me with my issue.  I left another message for the owner about two months ago, and still haven't heard anything.  Shady business. This has been going on since October 2011.  3rd note:  Still no call.  I am going to picket.  Seriously.
2	Had 2 sweaters, 1 shirt, and 2 coats to be dry cleaned.  The coat was returned to me after 3 days, saying they can't service coats with plastic buttons.  Earlier notification would have been better.  The other items were cleaned satisfactorily, though I would have liked them starched a bit more.
