4	My sister told me about this place so I ordered 1 large pepperoni pizzas to go for the family. Cheesy & delish. They have a $5 special for a large one topping, can't go wrong with that in our economy!! We're ordering it for dinner tonight. If you want a good pizza, try this place out!
5	Looks like they closed, sigh.
1	There is no wonder this place is out of business. They deserve a -1 star!When they first opened I decided to give them a try. Everyone wants to try a new pizza place. At first it looked like family business that probably made some good pies. When in reality Pizza Hut or Dominos is better and I don't order that kind of pizza. The pizza looked like a frozen pizza thrown into an oven and shoved into a crappy box. The bottom of the pizza had the little dots just like a frozen pizza from the grocery store! But the funny thing is, the frozen grocery store pizza tastes better than this did too!The sauce was l swear from a jar that read "pizza sauce" and the directions said "pour over pizza dough". YUCK! Just terrible and when I saw that they were out of business I smiled and said YES! Now, hopefully something good can go there in its place. 10 years ago it was Port of Subs and I have missed them ever since.... :(
4	So happy this place is back in Business !  Great Pizza, for the Price !
