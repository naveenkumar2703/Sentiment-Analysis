4	Have been with them for two years for my daughters braces and I can honestly say nothing but wonderful things about them. Very professional staff and doctor. Dr. Truman is great at making sure every patient feels comfortable with anything he does and actually calls his patients personally after their first consultation. Love them!
5	I saw this dentist to get a second opinion regarding advice I had gotten from another dentist telling me I needed braces.  For various reasons, I felt unsure that I really did need them - I feared they might do more harm than good and they were also VERY expensive -  and so I booked in a (free) consult with Dr Truman.He was excellent - he listened to my concerns and assessed my situation and informed me that I did not, in fact, need braces and also explained why.  He didn't try and sell me anything at all and was very straightforward.  If I did need orthodontic work, I would definitely come back to Dr Truman.   Excellent.
5	Can't say enough good things about Dr. Truman and his staff!! Everyone is so kind and always make my girls feel so comfortable during treatment visits. Dr. Truman always has fun contests each month and shows pictures of patients on the TV.
