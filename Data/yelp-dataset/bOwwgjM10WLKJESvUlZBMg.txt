1	Extremely dissatisfied at this time with the company!  Would give 0 stars if it were an option! We reserved lighting towers and generators for a school festival over 2 months in advance, I've called monthly to confirm and I'm told now (1 week prior to our event) that they don't have our reservation.  Despite my confirming with 3 different people at their office, they now say they are out of lights.  Barry now states he is "working on" trying to find me something, meanwhile the major fundraiser the year for this elementary school is in limbo.  I will update review and star rating if light towers are found for our event.
3	Renting the equipment has not been the issue.   There were charges added that should not have been and it took almost a month to resolve.   Now they have lost our check and we can not seem to connect with them so we can pay the bill.   It is ridiculous, we live in another state so I can not go into the store to make sure this is taken care of.   They need to work on getting more people to deal with billing issues.
