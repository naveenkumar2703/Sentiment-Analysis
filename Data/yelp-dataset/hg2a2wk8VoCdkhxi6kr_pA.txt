5	Beats my other favorite Ace, cuz this one serves Popcorn.  Same great service!  Same slow checkout (hey, these gals aren't 30 - and thank you Ace for giving them a job).  And same ability to buy one bolt.  Why the hell do we ever go to Lowe's or Home Depot.  Not any more!
3	Yes, the popcorn is always a big draw. I have to admit I don't go here a lot but once in a while they will have some good sales on tools, etc. The advantage that the big box stores have over Ace is selection. The advantage Ace has is service. If there is an item that I know I can find at Ace then I'll buy it there but sometimes I just find myself trudging into Home Despot or Loews...like moths to a lamp I suppose. But at Ace you've got good service, easy parking, no lineups and competitive prices so why not support the underdog once in a while?
3	I get here often as they are right across the street from a very good car wash in the area.  Their prices are above average compared to Lowes and Home Depot but the expertise here is amazing.  You will not find people as experienced and helpful like this at the other big stores.The only knock is that ultimately the selection is a fraction of what you would find at Lowes and Home Depot.For 99% of stuff, you'll find me here.
