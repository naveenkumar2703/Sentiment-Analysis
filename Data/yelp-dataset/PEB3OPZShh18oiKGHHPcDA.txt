1	I must look like a sucker. I needed a USB to micro USB cable and the guy says "oh yeah, he gots one". Total price was $22.69 out the door. For a lousy 3 foot cable. It was retractable. But I should have walked over and picked a cheaper and BETTER cable. As soon as I plugged it into my LG 11000 it put a message on the screen saying this cable is not recommended for this phone. OUCH! Not only do I get ripped off, but the cable is crap.I have had few good experiences with Radio Shack and should have gone to Fry's.
2	I've never been a fan of Radio Shack. Ever since I was young I've been treated to sexist behavior from Radio Shack employees, as if it's part of the Radio Shack culture. That may have changed now that more women work there, but my early experiences totally turned me off from this place.  That being said, in a pinch I will go to one for a cable or something. I needed an audio jack and they had a 3-ft one for $9.99.  I said, "No thanks" and bought a 6 ft one for $9.98 at Walmart.  Ahh, Walmart, the store I love to hate.
1	Go to other Radio Shack! This Radio Shack its ok but other ones are better.
