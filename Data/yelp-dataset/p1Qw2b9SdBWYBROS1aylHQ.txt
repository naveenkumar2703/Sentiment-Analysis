4	Probably one of the largest and best Judaica stores I've ever been in!  I've come here several times to buy presents for the Holidays or when I needed to buy a Mezuzah or Mitzvah gift.  The folks who work here are very nice and helpful.  So, if you need some wine for a Shabbat dinner, or whatever, you need to come here first!BTW, they also give some of there profits to the local Shul of your choice.  Nice!
5	Friendly and helpful. There are several items to choose from. I went in quick for one specific item and because I am not Jewish, I asked for help right away and I was quickly shown the item I needed!
2	Went in and found it way to expensive and over priced on most items. I'm usually a fan of supporting local businesses, but can't do so in this case.
3	this business has closed.
