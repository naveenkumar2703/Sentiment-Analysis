1	No!I would stay clear from any product that comes out of a factory that would allow product with INSECTS in it to be sold to innocent people...and children! There was a leg of some insect in mine. I did not eat the rest.It's not just the insects (like that wouldn't be the one thing to scare you away) but it's the freaking quality. Now, I've had some from Coffee Plantation at Westgate and man oh man...that stuff is AMAZING!It's smooth and rich and NOT GRAINY OR WATERY like you-know-who's.It tastes like the real deal in Italy.OUTSTANDING is how I would rate that gelato. Angelo's will never be one of my choices again. EVER!P.S. The Food City next door has rats in it. I wouldn't trust the buildings next to it.  No rodent droppings for me please.
1	Not only was Angelo's Italian lemon water ice awful but they also had the nerve to charge a BLEEPING ten dollars for our two cups. We tossed them in the garbage after one spoonful.Very artificial in taste with an odd texture and very expensive.
4	Good stuff! Much needed on a hot day!
5	Delicious. I have been having them since I was a little kid and still eat them over a decade later because they are so good. So many different flavors to chose from also. My personal favorite is their rainbow Italian ice. Has three flavors in one which are all delicious. Their gelato is delicious as well. These are a definite must try.
