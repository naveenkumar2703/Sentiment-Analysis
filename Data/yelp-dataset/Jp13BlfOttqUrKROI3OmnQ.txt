1	Please do not visit this "spa!" The "swedish massage" I received was a lady simply rubbing oil all over my body. She didn't work into any of my muscles and her draping techniques were extremely inappropriate. I receive massages on a very regular basis and have never felt so violated during a treatment. The lady also informed me that she has been performing "swedish massages" under her aesthetics license and isn't actually licensed in massage -yikes!!
1	I also have had too many bad services here. My first Swedish massage was a simple oil application and she didn't even touch my hands or feet. WhatMassage doesnt include feet. Then I had a "facial" where she cleanses my face, put on an exfoliating mask then a moisturizer. There were a lot of steps missed. And my hour facial was turned into 30 min. She also made comments to me about my skin which I felt were rude. I returned in about a month due to the package I had and the massage was better but I had to askFor my feet to be done and I had the exfoliating add on which entails a dry sponge like thing used on the body. She didn't do my whole body andIt was a waste of money. Then the facial,I added a peel because I knew I wasn't going to get a real facial and long story short she didn't cleanse my face well and used something that caused meTo break out. No extractions done nothing. I too wondered about the licenses and if there was any real training.For the record I am a licensed professional familiar with what the services should have been like.Find another spot.
4	I have never been here but A for Alexandra should know if she is a licensed professional that not all massages are the same. I'm an LMT and a foot massage isn't ALWAYS performed in a swedish massage.  In fact, I usually NEVER work on someone's feet unless they specifically as for it.
