2	Convenient local location, but every time we go there, the line is long and they are always struggling to find enough cars for all the reservations.  I don't know if that is the fault of the local office or if it is Hertz in general, but what is the point of a reservation if not to make sure you have sufficient cars available.
2	Is this a daycare or car rental service? I dropped a friend off who received awful directions from staff on how to get here. When we arrived, I could see why. The place was swarming with children belonging to BOTH staff members and appointments were continually interrupted by screams in the back and interruptions for mommy.  Not very professional.
5	I received amazing service here when my car broke down while visiting Arizona from California. I am under 24 and did not have a state license or a credit card and every company I called seemed to need one or the other.Finally, Hertz, at the 11th hour told me they could help me out and $100 and fifteen mins later I was ready to roll out.Thank you for saving me!!!!!!
5	Recently rented a car from here and they were nothing but helpful. Brian helped schedule our appointment. When we arrived another agent (cannot recall her name) was very knowledgeable and sincere. She upgraded us for free once she learned of our situation.  The bereavement discount was appreciated as well. We will use this Hertz rental before anywhere else. The one close to our home was most unhelpful so the drive to Sun City was well worth it. Thank you to the staff at Sun City Hertz rental!
