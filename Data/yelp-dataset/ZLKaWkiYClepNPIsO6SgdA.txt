5	Always friendly & clean
5	This place is like my Cheers! I go at least 3 times a week on my way to work for my iced tea and the staff always greets me by name! The fact that they have crushed ice is just icing on the cake.  Plus...where else can you find so many different fountain drinks in one place?Always clean and well stocked!  I feel like I'm cheating on my QT if I go to a different one!
2	QTs are usually pretty clean,fast etc but this one is the most ghetto QT I've ever seen. It is in the Tolleson area so par for the course I suppose.
5	I come here a lot. It is convenient to my location. And of course it is always open. And who doesn't like to hear someone say hi to you every once in a while.
