4	I was in an accident & was sent to this place by the insurance of the person that hit me.  Great recommendation.  They were consistently pleasant and did a great job.  They even noticed more work that needed to be done that an average joe such as myself couldn't have noticed.  The one downfall, they didn't completely insert my bed liner but when I mentioned it to them, they were ready to help and help they did!
5	Freaking AMAZING.  Went for an estimate on front end damage.  They looked at car within two minutes of my arrival.  They figured out they could fix it quick and easy.  Bent a couple things back in place, replaced broken clips and I Drove out 5 minutes later.  NO CHARGE.  They could have really ripped me off.  Will absolutely bring my car there if needed.  And happy to post my experience.  I sincerely appreciate the honesty of a company that works on cars.
5	Hey do such great work here. Have been here for all my auto body repairs. They are honest and hard working. Recommended by many insurance companies too. Check them out if you ever need them.
5	These guys were great!!! The estimate was almost half of one of their competitors I've US d in the past and the work is excellent. They also were done a lot earlier than I expected. The office staff and estimator were very friendly. And to top it off, they washed the exterior and detailed the interior of my car! Didn't expect that. I highly recommend them. I will definitely repeat if needed. Also if you dont believe me, check out their reviews on Garagefly.com.
