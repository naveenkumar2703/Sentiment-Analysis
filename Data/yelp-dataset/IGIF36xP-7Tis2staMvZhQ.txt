2	Very high gas prices at this convenient location. Clean, nice place, but I'm giving it only 2 stars for the gas prices. You can get Tonto passes for camping here, about the only place in the area where you can (Besides Big 5 on Northsight). Arco down the street has the best gas prices around this area.
2	The people that work here are lame. Don't accidentally rip a barcode. They aren't smart enough to type in the numbers for the code or at least know how much a product costs to manually type in the price. It was annoying. A lot of items needed to be restocked.Fine array of sandwiches though....didn't eat one.Never returning to this one again.
3	Conveniently located near my house, I fill up here all the time.  Space is tight here to fill up for gas.  The lanes are narrow and the landscaping and curbing of the shopping center makes it tough to get in/out of the gas lanes when it's busy.However, the convenience store rocks.  There's a big, walk-in beer cooler to grab supplies on game days.  They also have a decent selection of Wine when you're in a pinch....and it's not priced that bad either.  Solid store.Return Factor - 100%
