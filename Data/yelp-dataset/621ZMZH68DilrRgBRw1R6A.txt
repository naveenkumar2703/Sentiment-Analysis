5	The only chiropractic office you will ever need! The staff here is professional and accomodating, as well as super friendly. There are massage therapists on site too. Dr Smith knows his medicine,  and i always left feeling great!
5	I love Dr. Scott!! He is the funniest doctor I've ever met and he makes me feel good too! Dr. Scott is always willing to bend over backwards to make sure you are provided the best service and treatment possible. The massage therapists rock too! I will be a lifelong patient of Integrated Chiropractic.
5	Dr. Scott is an awesome chiro. He really cares about his patients. He is also hilarious, which makes adjustments much more fun. I can't recommend him and his wonderful office staff more highly.
