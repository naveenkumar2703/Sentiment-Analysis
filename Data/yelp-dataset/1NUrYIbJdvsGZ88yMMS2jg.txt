5	So far so good. Nice receptionist on my first visit here.  I walked in without an appointment and they were able to fit me in. I did have to wait some time, but it was nice not to have to drive back to that part of town again for an appointment on another day.
5	Well as most people know I am not a real fan of doctors.....and especially don't like going to other facilities for additional tests. However on Thursday (Dec 5th) I paid a visit to this location because I needed X-Rays for my foot. When I walked in I was greeted by perhaps the most professional and delightful receptionist I have ever met. The young lady's name was Tiffany and she got me squared away before I even knew what was happening. I was in and out of the establishment in less than 25 minutes.....so Tiffany please keep up the good work.....and if any of you reading this ever need quality service along with QUALITY customer care......please visit this locale. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!
5	This is the place to go for your imaging needs. Scheduling very easy. I had an order from an urgent care doctor and they were able to get me in same day. Friendly staff put me at ease (I was a little nervous). My appt was at 830a. I was told to show up 15-20 min early for paperwork. I show up at 8:07a. Complete paperwork. Get called back for procedure at 8:25a. Done and on the road by 8:45a. Radiologist transcribed report and sent over to my doc w/ in 3 hours! :)
5	Super quick and very friendly.  I only wish I lived closer as this is probably not somewhere I will return because it's not terribly close to me.
