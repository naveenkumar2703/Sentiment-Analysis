5	Natalia is my granddaughters stylist. She does an awesome job, is always available and wonderfully pleasant!!!
5	My stylist recently joined this salon.  I've been going to her for years, as has my mother.  The salon is absolutely beautiful!  It's very clean, colorful, modern, a bit funky, and it's fun.  I only see KIM, because she has always proven to do the ultimate best job I've seen.  She spends extra time perfecting every detail of finishing me off.  Any time I tell her my concerns or what I want, you can tell she sincerely listens and tries to understand the look I'm thinking of.  She'll ask me questions to make sure she can clearly visualize what I want.  I completely trust her now, and when I come in, it's up to her.  I let her decide what to do.  I don't feel the need to give her any direction.  I can't say this enough, I trust her, and she's wonderful. Back to the salon,The rest of the staff is laid back, and they seem genuinely happy to be there.  They're such cool girls.  It actually seems like a place you would just want to go and hang out.  There's a coffee shop nearby, but I would rather get it to go and come back to enjoy it here.KIM, KIM, KIM!!!
5	Very convenient and you have a coffee shop across the street and a Chinese food place the next door down.  My stylist, Jen Taylor, moved to Pin-Ups a few months ago.  Jen is great and VERY caring.  She is a great person and a talented stylist.  I have a dramatic A-line Bob and lets just say that not everyone can pull off the cut but Jen does it great!  She is also very reasonably priced too.  Stay out of those Anthem Beauty Shops and give downtown Henderson a shot.  You will not regret it!  :)
