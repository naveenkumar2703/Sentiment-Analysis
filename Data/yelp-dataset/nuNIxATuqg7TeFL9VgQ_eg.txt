4	We always find deals when we come to this outlet center. Stopped at the Dickie store and found great shorts for $9.99 a pair.
5	5 stars since the Dickies outlet makes my man so happy.All year he deals with my shopping addiction, happily (or  not) carries my bags and "lends" his wallet, so I took him here after him being so patient at Ferragamo for an hour (twice) Women shop by trying on, trying on again, leaving to think about it, coming back to get it, trying it on at home again, at least I do.My husband shops about once a year, grabs everything he likes, no trying on or thinking involved and is set for the whole year, simple, finished in less than 10 minutes.$400 for 20 pairs of Dickies and a happy husband (though he did mention how his 20 pants cost less than one pair of my new shoes...) what more could I ask for???
4	They have a lot of shirt sizes for being a small store, but they don't really have outlet prices. A lot of uniform stores have lower prices.
4	I have very little patience for shopping, especially in a crowded place. I like this store because they don't mess with the layout inside. I get in, get what I know I want, and I get out. Friendly staff helping all who enter. Definitely worth a visit if this is your brand
4	I really like the work pants that Dickies make.  Paid $19.99 plus tax for my pants.I also like this particular location because they are located at the indoor outlet mall in Las Vegas.  It makes things much more comfortable during those hot summer months.Dickies makes quality durable clothes and sell them here at affordable prices!Yes, I am a fan!  4 stars!!
1	It looks like this Dickies Store is CLOSED!!!  Not in the Outlets South location any more.  Bummed!
