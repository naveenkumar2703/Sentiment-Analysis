4	I only have one small experience here so I am a little hesitant to write a review, but I had such a positive experience I couldn't resist!I was told by a mechanic that I needed a battery replaced right away, but I decided to get a second opinion before giving him my money.  I came to checker to get the battery tested and they said it was fine.I was greeted by both employees in the front of the store as soon as I came in and got perfect, fast, friendly and professional service.  What more could I want?  I will definitely go back there for all my auto part needs.
4	After my rough experiences at other auto parts stores that shall remain nameless, I decided to come here for a change.  Its a little out of my way, but not to much.I came here because I needed windshield washer fluid for my Jeep before I headed out of town.  I didnt want the usual cheap crap either.  I wanted the good stuff!Anyways, came in here and everything went fine.  Service was okay, everything here was clean and well stocked, and I got what I needed.  I would return here in the future!!
4	Free Diagnostic print-out if your service engine light comes on!  They have good prices on parts, too.Other than that, it's your basic auto store.  Might see ya there!
4	The guys here are great, knowledgeable, and don't make you feel like an idiot if you don't know cars. It's in a shopping center I love, right next to Trader Joe's and Wildflower, two places I go to all the time, so it's convenient. Their prices are competitive and they're friendly and helpful. What more can you ask for in an automotive parts store.
