5	Quik and easy and very friendly service
5	Always friendly, clean and if there is something wrong they try to fix it.  Each location that I have gone to has always great service.
3	Located just off the freeway, this is a convenient place to grab cheap gas if you're in the area.  Like most of the QT's around the Valley, the lanes are wide and the place is busy.  They have a large convenience store that's clean and offers all of the normal items you find in a store.Return Factor - 75%
4	I should be giving Quik Trip 5 stars, as I'm obsessed with their awesomeness....but I have to say the cleanliness of this particular store is sub-par.  The drinks?  Can't beat it.  Friendliness?  Next to none.  Cleanliness?  They need to get on it.
5	I am a HUGE fan of QT. I wish they had them were I live (in the Seattle area). They have friendly employees, lots and lots and lots of choices in regard to food and drink, and clean bathrooms. Love this place!
