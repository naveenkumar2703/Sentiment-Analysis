4	Whenever I need styling products, this is my go to spot.  They have a large variety of products to choose from.  I especially like it because you can get the salon size version of the product you're looking for and save a few bucks.  They also carry a lot of the new items that your stylist might have but are extremely hard to find in a grocery store.Return Factor - 90%
4	I can't say enough about one hairstylist in particular. Julia is the ONLY one in Scottsdale who I trust to touch my lovely long locks. She listens to what I want, but also contributes suggestions. She is a color genius, creating stunning dimension that can be subtle for a less noticeable grow-out over time, or dramatic and bold. She is meticulous, and proud of her work. She also makes the time fly by making conversation and overall treating you like you're talking to a friend you've known for years. Overall time in the chair is a little long, but I'm willing to spend a few extra hours to walk out feeling like doing a Beyonce hair flip
5	I love both the store and the salon. Both have helpful staff that always seem happy to be there. The selection of products is great and it's not as overwhelming as some other Ulta locations. I visited the salon last weekend for the BCRF benefit and got an amazing haircut for my $10 donation. The stylist (Karen) took her time and made me feel comfortable. I've even made another appointment to see her for a trim in December. This is the perfect one stop beauty shop.
