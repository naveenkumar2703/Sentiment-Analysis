5	This is the place I have been looking for! I finally feel like I will reach my goal because I actually feel comfortable here.  I was a member at 24 Hour and LVAC but I honestly was wasting money at those places because they were kind of intimidating and always so darn crowded! Anytime Fitness is the next best thing to having my own private gym. I get to use the equipment easily because its such a low-key place where an average person like me can really workout. I was able to afford a trainer too and its going so well becuase they really are knowledgeable and understand what I need because i have tried diets and exercise so many times before and failed. I really think this time with the support of my trainer I will finally get these last 25 lbs off and NEVER gain them back!
3	This location is alright.. I think I'm spoiled by the free wi-fi and supplements at my usual Anytime gym.  Also, this one doesn't have showers like the location I frequent so I probably wouldn't hit this gym before I go school/work even though this one is close to both of those locations.  Equipment is good and this gym is pretty much always clean.  Not a lot of people come here when I stroll through in the morning so that's always nice.  Sigh.. wish it was a little bit better but I guess you can't win 'em all.
5	I like this place because it's small, but still has everything you need and it's never crowded. A few times i have had the place to myself! All the trainers are cool and nice and they can work with you on personal training costs:)
