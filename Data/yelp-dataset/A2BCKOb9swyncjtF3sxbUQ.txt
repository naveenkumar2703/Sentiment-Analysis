1	What a beautiful place to get robbed.  Probably not when what you were thinking when you entered this immaculate old country themed veterinarian hospital or lack there of.  After I told them about a KNOWN allergy to the rabies vaccine my dogs had ...they proceeded to give them the vaccine with an appropriate  benadryl shot beforehand, and send them home.... NOPE, no monitoring for even a couple hours.  So when I got home and my beloved pets swelled up like a balloon I rushed thm back to a SURPRISED office staff. They correctly gave both dogs (one was balloon-like, the other had a rash all over)  IV steroid and waited by ....for a little bit...then they RECHARGED me for the second visit an extra 100 dollars.  Hmmmm they like to charge you like its going out of style it seems.  Did I blame them for the reaction experienced by my pets..NO. DO I blame them for lack of consideration in billing me a 2nd time in the same day....YES!!
1	Definately don't treat their employees well. Two thumbs down!
4	I had a bit of an emergency situation present itself with my dog and this place was recommended by a friend. I found the entire staff to be very nice and they listened to my concerns. Especially when I told them I did not have a lot of money. They did not charge me any emergency fees and they took exceptional care of my doggie. Dr. Joiner was super caring as was Edith at the front desk. It cost a bit more than a Banfield but I think it's worth it. I prefer to have a relationship with my vets and doctors and these folks rose to the occasion. The tech, doctor and office admin all came out to say good-bye to my dog. I look forward to returning for the follow up in two weeks. They CARE!
5	I had some issues develop with my dogs stitches after the surgery. The vet was very responsive and asked me to come in right away. I feel like they really care. No charge for the visit either.
