4	I didn't go here until October, though I've walked past here for years, but much to my surprise, it's the best Burger king I've ever been to. You know what you're getting into menu-wise for Burger King, but the art work is light-hearted, and the place is open and quiet, which makes a great dining experience for fast food. The food is surprisingly fresh, and nice quality. They even have an electronic menu behind the counter which is entertaining in it's own right.
5	April 7:No more Angry Whopper.They now have the Chipotle Whopper that comes with bacon.Haven't tried it.For 5 bucks I go to In N Out and get fries with my Double-Double animal style.Stop trying to rape, BK.But go for the 2 regular Whoppers for $5.DEAL!!!Mix n match actually.Really, have you ever had a BAD whopper? :)============================================Please send me a message if this deal has changed.I suspect the 55 cent second Whopper has expired as of March 2013......
3	Like the rivalry between Coke and Pepsi there are pros and cons to choosing the number 1 or number 2 option. Number 1 will always be more consistent but once in a while number 2 will turn out a surprise. McDonald's does the same as time wise in the drive through it seemed like it took ages to fulfill a 2 item order. They also put ranch into my not so-honey-mustarded chicken wrap.  However, I was quite  surprised ; this ain't the tasteless burger king I remember circa mid 2000's I haven't been to a burger king since they took away the angry tendercrisp and I was happy to have gone as the food was fried fresh and was much better then surrounding fast food in taste. Then again they took a lot of time...DO I GIVE THEM  3 OR DO I GIVE EM 4 I went with the former
1	I had been craving turkey burgers in a big way, saw the add for Burger King & thought pehaps it would be a good idea to give it a try, wrong! The turkey burger was bland, and it was covered in ketchup, gross, got about 5 fries and a cup low on soda and full of ice,7 bucks of so not worth the money!Good thing the sign said it's only around for a limited time! You have been demoted to Burger Prince, I'll stick to buying and making them at home!
5	I feel like this BK is the best in the valley as far as service, food quality, and quickness. The employees are always friendly inside or in the drive thru.keep it up
