4	Outback surprised me. My girlfriend has a favorite salad there that she was craving one night so I went along. It struck me as a little strange that my vegetarian girlfriend would even have Outback Steakhouse on her radar, but I suppose stranger things have happened. Anyhow, so we get there and it is just as cheeseball corporate as it can be, but I'm ok with that. Then our server turns out to be super nice and she recommends some appetizers that turn out to be really good and even my girlfriend's salad was tasty. Word to the wise: don't be shaken by the corporation. Outback is for real.
3	Outback is solid. The food is consistent, good, and always cooked the right way. I'm obsessed with their bread!This night, our service was sub-par. I don't remember the guy's name, but he was boring, slow, and paid way more attention to an older couple than he did to our younger-aged group. I hate when servers do that.
3	The service there is really not that good, as far as getting you seated goes.  I arrived there at about 5:00 P.M. and they didn't have a table there and made me wait 20 minutes.  So if you are planning to go, expect to wait at least 10 minutes, usually. But the food is always good, their bread is one of my favorites.  They have some great appetizers, like the Bloomin' Onions.  My server was very polite and was very good on the refills.
3	The outback is a place you can always come and eat and know you will get a solid meal. It isn't five star dining however you aren't paying for that. I have however noted that the salad has gotten smaller sneaky as has the bloomin onion...Hey we are all cutting back folks but the price hasn't :(I like the deal they give you on their house wine for $2 you can't go wrong. A solid steak that is about the same as one at home just costs more. If you are in a hurry and want a salad and potato etc before a movie or something this is a great deal...Not somewhere I would come to impress somebody however :)The waitstaff however is generally very good...
3	Looking for a place to eat at the Scottsdale 101, we were looking for a particular restaurant, but couldn't find it. I think it was Capital Grill. Later on I found the website and it's a bit pricey for casual dining.Outback was packed at 6:30. We waited about 20 minutes and found some seating in the bar area. My wife and I had the prime rib, medium rare and my daughter had the chick sandwich. Chris, our waiter, was average. My side of cesear salad had a hint of too much salt. It could have been in the cheese. My wife had the 8  oz and I had th 12 oz prime rib. It was cooked to perfection, but my prime rib was unevenly cut and had a lot of fat. But all in all, it was a nice dinner.
5	I work near this Outback and was just introduced to their curbside takeout. On nights I work late and have to pick up dinner this is a snap! PLUS with their 6oz sirloin with two sides for $9.95 who could go wrong?The steaks are always really good and tender and well seasoned. I usually get a baked potato and salad with fat free tomato dressing and dont feel guilty about anything! My man likes a ceasar with fries, and you can get garlic mashed, sweet potato's or steamed veggies too. Outback is now on our takeout rotation for being cheap, easy and most importantly- a good meal!
4	My husband and I at at this Outback last week with friends. The staff was wonderful and the food was great. We will be back to visit again.
3	The Outback is a family favorite when we want give ourselves and the kids a "treat." We have always enjoyed the food, and the service and atmosphere have been satisfactory. In the past year, however, the experience has been less enjoyable. It seems this chain has decided to reduce portion sizes while simultaneously raising prices. For example, the 9oz filet is now an 8 oz filet, and the Mac 'n Cheese (my kids' favorite) is now served on a much smaller plate. As a result, our family has started to look for alternatives, and we find ourselves visiting Outback less often, although when we do visit, the quality of the food is as high as always. They know how to cook a steak to order, and their Caesar salad is possibly the best I've had anywhere. Overall a good place to eat - I just wish the owners had not tried to be so sneaky with the smaller portions.
4	Every trip to Outback is a pleasant one. The food, beer, service, and atmosphere is always consistent. I'm very fond of this location because the Manager is very hands on and the bartender, Brian is the best! They make me feel very welcome. I highly recommend!
1	The food was actually great, this review is for the service. I was actually blown away by the terrible service we received from our waiter. From the moment he came to our table, I knew we what we were in for. It was one smart mouth comment after another from him. He was very negative about happy hour when we inquired what the specials were."There is a  happy hour, its nothing really special, but yeah, there is a happy hour".  ok.  We never did hear what the happy hour entailed. We waited quite some time for our drinks.  He messed up a dinner order and said that cook must have read the order wrong , so while 3 of us received our dinners, 1 sat with an empty bread plate. We had to ask for bread and he appeared very bothered by that, commenting, " I was about to bring it to you anyway." We waited quite some time for the checks. When he finally appeared, he said that the person that rang up our order , did it incorrectly, so he made the corrections in pen on the receipt. We carefully looked at the check and saw errors right away. When we brought it to his attention, he made another smart comment about another server probably ringing it up wrong. Never a smile,  thank you, have a good night, nothing. It was an incredibly negative experience. A member of our party spoke to a manger as we were leaving. When he told the manager some of the comments made by our server, she said " I know exactly who you are talking about. Was it *****?"  and it was.   Wow.   I don't care so much that the service was a little slow, it was the server's negative attitude that totally turned me off. Again , our food was great, but I just can't justify paying 50 bucks for dinner& drinks and being treated so poorly.Will not be returning .
5	Ok, so I get that Outback doesn't deserve a proper restaurant critics 5 star.  Sometimes however, you never realize how good a thing is you have until you've lost it.  Rewind about a about 8 months ago when all of my friends were living right on the doorstep of the Outback right in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale.  If I had a nickel for all the of  $13.99 steak and potatoes or $2 wells I could feed a small village in a poor country for the rest of their lives.  So I guess to comment on my particular experience here, it was one of my last days in Scottsdale and sinking my teeth into their 10oz Filet cooked medium rare was like getting smacked in the face with a flashback of all the great times I had at the Old Town location, coupled with the mayhem in Old town after.Price - *****Quailty - ***Experience - ****Memories - Priceless.Thanks Outback!
2	We went to the Happy Hour at Outback tonight and really enjoyed our meal and the very attentive service of it's wait staff. The food was good, not great mind you but good. Hey, this isn't Morton's but it's a friendly staff wants your repeat business. Enjoy!
4	Best Outback I've ever been to.
4	I hate to admit it but Outback serves a damn good piece of meat for the money. I also enjoyed their blue cheese wedge side salad. The atmosphere is nice and dark and the service is pretty good too. As much as I like to slam chain restaurants I'll admit this one is pretty good.
4	My family loves Outback. What keeps bringing us back is the well-priced quality food in a no frills atmosphere. Why frequent this chain? Because some days you just want to chow down on a giant fried onion flower and a nice sirloin steak. And pay less than $15 for it.Steak entrees come with one side and a soup or salad. Recently tried the blue cheese wedge salad and it was amazing! If you're looking for a small portion, go with the 6 oz Outback sirloin ($9.99).Happy hour deals: $3.95 for many appetizers, including the famed Bloomin' Onion, and $2 draft beers.
2	This is strictly for how they operate their "Call Ahead" seating. Their food is usually impeccable. I will never understand their stupid call ahead, maintain two list, absurd process. I called ahead at 6:50 pm. Was told the wait was 40 min. Great as I would be there in 40 min so I had my name placed on the list. Got there at 7:30 and they couldn't find my name. So they put my name on the "call ahead" list and told about 30 min wait while they were on a 1 hour wait at this point (exactly why I called ahead).Talked to the "manager" (really just the key server) and she said they did have my name on the "call ahead" list and my wait would be about 30 min. That the "call ahead" list just shortens your wait to about half the current wait. Really? And just how do they go about calculating this? My wife has worked for Outback for over 6 years and says that system is still as screwed up as when they first introduced it.Here's a novel idea, when someone calls, just put their name on the list! If they're not there when called, skip them, just as if they showed up in person. Really not that hard and you don't have to maintain two separate lists forever trying to explain your logic in doing so to customers.The truth is, Outback really doesn't care about this system. They're always on a wait so no big deal if customers don't like it and go home. It just reduces the wait time. So we left and went across the street to Gordon Biersch. That's another review.
3	Had the wings here for the first time and it was amazing. The house salad was great like always. Except I tried the new filet and shrimp dish with mash potatoes as the side and was not impressed with it at all. The filet was bland and the mash potatoes had some raw pieces in it.
2	**********Chew Your So-Called Steak Well**********            'Cause if you don't ...........You'll chokeKnives........extremely dull ......bring your own Ginsu knifeMy steak......like armourFlavor..........Guess its expecting too much for $12.99 ?????Sweet Potato Fries.......very goodWould I ever return..........not unless I lost my memory PLUS I don't own a Ginsu Knife
5	We have been coming here since the day it opened and the food is ALWAYS consistently great. The servers are well trained and always attentive, the atmosphere is always clean and tidy. (I have even seen employees off to the side SCRUBBING the silverware to make sure it is all spotless before they place it on the table.)As of lately, we have been using their curbside to-go service and it's always spot on. We send the order through their website online and it's usually ready in about 20 minutes or so (depending on the day). All I have to do is pull up my car, and they bring everything to me (major OMGAWWW AWESOME factor for me ^.^)As for the call ahead seating, seriously folks?!? It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this out. You have two options:1) Call Outback before you leave the house, tell them you have #_ folks coming to eat and you will be there in __ minutes. They put your name on the wait list. This is just a way of getting your name on the list a little earlier.or2) You arrive at Outback with #_ folks and say "Hi, we're here to get our grub on" and they put your name on the wait list and you get to sit there and wait as the folks who arrived after you (but called in their party onto the list, ahead of their arrival) get seated before you.Again, not rocket science. And even if for some reason something happens to your call ahead seating spot and it gets lost, don't be a jerk about it. Just call in one of their awesome managers and calm the DERP down.
4	The excellent manager of this Outback, SCOTT, is the absolute savior of our most recent evening here. We were in a hurry to see a movie, so we should have allowed more time, not anticipating we would have a few mishaps en route. OK. Our hostess was friendly; our waitress, Kim, was cheerful, took our order quickly, and assured us she would do everything in her power to get us in & out quickly. Great!  We believed her, as she did not have more than a couple of tables to take care of.The food runner brought our Caesar salads & disappeared.  As soon as we lifted our forks we could plainly see there was not a drop of dressing nor a speck of parmesan on them. As we knew no one was going to do a tableside presentation to dress these dry pieces of lettuce, we sat mute...looking everywhere in vain for our waitress.  Fortunately, Scott was actually DOING HIS JOB and came over.  He immediately took the lettuce and returned with 2 delicious, properly-dressed Caesars! Thank you!  Our steaks then arrived via another "runner" and were cooked to perfection. Very nice.Not needing coffee or dessert (not that we were asked....as our waitress was no where around) we began to look around again for our waitress., as we needed the check.  No luck.  Clock ticking away. Finally, a polite runner was flagged down & she proceeded to go in search of our waitress.  Not finding her, she did produce the check for us, but we had to again ask her if she could now take our payment so we could leave.  She left & we were stranded again.... for quite a while. My hubs said, "Sometimes it helps it you stand up" and did so. From the far side I saw Scott notice him & go to the kitchen, apparently in another fruitless attempt to find our waitress for us.  In another minute, he was at our table apologizing.SCOTT is a true professional & has his restaurant's success in mind.  We were not angry, just in a hurry, and he comped our meal---to our absolute surprise.  Just as we left our booth, our waitress returned from Antarctica (or wherever the heck she was all evening) and she proceed to scoop up our credit card & tried to run off! We explained the circumstances & left her a generous tip (which she did NOT deserve!). Scott should be the President of Outback Steakhouse. His CREW is truly lucky to have such a leader present and on the job.
3	Outback is always reliably sufficient, but suffers on all levels from a feeling of outdated corporate oversight. Most notable for me are the disappointingly archaic beer and scotch offerrings, as well as the lovelessly prepared food. The chain serves meat - they don't seem to really care about the rest.
5	Of all the Outback restaurants in town, this one is THE BEST!  We eat there frequently and enjoy sitting at the bar.  The bar staff is THE best. The wedge salad is great, and their steaks are cooked perfectly to desired temperature. The lamb chops are very good.  Meat seasoning is always perfect and their salads are always very fresh.  Great noisy meeting place for friends.  Good food at the right price.  Our favorite bar hang out.  Liz and Wally.
5	If I had the ability to choose my last meal on Earth, it would be what I had last night at Outback. Yeah, it's a chain and I ALWAYS order the same thing every time. I really REALLY love it! Always consistently amazing and never disappointing!So for last night at THIS location:Bread with butter- Awesome! What is it, molasses bread or something? Whatever it is, the semi-crusty bread with fresh whipped butter was good enough for me to eat an entire mini loaf myself (and I usually never fill up on bread).Caesar salad- The first time I had an Outback Caesar, I didn't really care for it. It does not taste like your average Caesar dressing, it's got a peppery kick to it. It grew on me however, now it's my favorite! So good and well dressed with plenty of croutons!Herb-crusted prime rib (picture posted)- OMG, this is even more amazing than the "regular" prime rib I used to get here (which they don't have anymore). I always get it medium-rare without steak sear (I would think searing it would defeat the purpose of eating a nice, pink cut of prime rib). Oh, also ask for the creamy horseradish on the side. I wish I knew the recipe for it because it's delicious and not overly spicy. I usually do not have a large appetite, but  I must admit to finishing an entire 16oz cut, just couldn't stop eating (fyi, over the 8oz cut, you can get 16 for just $5 more... much better deal).Green beans- Even the green beans here were picture perfect and  cooked just right. They reminded me of the ones I had at Morton's (which is pretty pricey in comparison).Sangria- I had the blackberry and strawberry-peach. They were both good, but go with the latter, it was by far the best.Waitstaff- Our waitress was pretty good. Very professional and friendly, but not overly so (some people may like or dislike that). No complaints here! I also liked how another waiter and even the manager pitched in to clear some of our dishes when she was busy. That's teamwork! Oh, the manager also stopped by to ask how our food was, shows he genuinely cares!  :)*My 2-cents on a recent reviewer that blamed Outback for giving him and a friend a bad cold/flu. These viruses take time to incubate, up to 2 weeks in some cases. The likelihood of becoming this ill after less than 24 hours of exposure is pretty low in my experience (I'm a mom and have been sick many times in my life). I've also been sick at the same time as friends who live across town that I haven't seen for awhile, same symptoms and everything. We live in a big city with a lot of nasty non-handwashers. Just thought a possible coincidence with no real basis for blame was unfair for a 1-star review.  :/
2	Man, the quality of Outback has really gone down since the last time I came here. I hope it was just an off night, but everything seemed to go wrong.  The menu was wrong on several occasions. My husband ordered the Sam Adams on draft. Says it should be a Boston Lager, but the Summer Ale came out. Apparently they were out of Boston Lager on tap but the server didn't tell us and didn't offer anything else. The chicken artichoke flatbread was delicious, but the menu says a "sprinkling of parmesan cheese". The thing was heavily covered in it. I would have asked for light cheese if I'd known it was more like a cheese crisp. I ordered the steak salad medium, it came out medium rare. Also, it didn't say that gorgonzola cheese crumbles came on it, otherwise I would have asked for those to be left off. So unfortunately I had to send it back. The manager was very polite and took the flatbread off our bill, but when he tried to explain that they were out of the Boston Lager beer and that's why we got the Summer Ale, I was a little annoyed. Okay that's fine, it would have just been nice to know that in the beginning. Don't give me excuses. All in all it was a very mediocre service and just not as good as I remember.
3	5 of us went and 5 of us had a good meal. Our waiter Cooper was very nice and attentive. The garlic mash taters a bit lumpy for the way I like them, but they were decent. They serve a killer margarita! I had a 6 oz filet med/rare and it was done perfectly. Went around 6pm and I am used to Outbacks always being packed and loud. This one was not.
4	While I'd like to slam this chain steak house, I just can't... Because the food was great! Wifey had a craving for prime rib, and we had been here before for this entree. I had some kind of a hamburger, and it was absolutely perfect, and so was her prime rib. The service was excellent, and overall the price was great. Not a big fan of chains, but I'd go back here. The couple next to us asked a manager over, and apparently, they are big fans of The outback, and they told the Gal that this was the best one they'd ever been to. I believe them! Great waiter and staff as well.
2	I Have been to lots of Outbacks, but this one was REALLY bad.Bad serviceI had the prime rib and it was o.k. but my dad got the porterhouse and it was not good at all. The cut was horrible and it was not cooked properly. They had to take it back 3 times to re-cook, with no success of getting it right. They get two stars for at least taking the Porterhouse off the bill, but it just made the whole experience worthy of a bad review. I will not be returning to this location.
3	This Outback is in a great location for shopping at some fun stores and the parking is easy.  The food was served up quickly, our server was polite and efficient in taking care of our needs, and everything was clean.The downside was the food prep - we wanted un-buttered steaks but when they came out they were very obviously covered in it.  It's not a deal breaker and we didn't have time to wait for a "do over" since we were on our way to another place after.  I actually prefer the steaks un-buttered at Outback since it brings out the flavor of their seasonings more.  Everything else was prepared to order and we will definitely go back again since this is the first slip up we've had at an Outback in some time.Overall: A-
4	As far as chain restaurants go for steakhouse this is probably one of the best. The management here is really proactive and concerned about making sure you have a good experience. I had an issue with the cook on my steak. Garrett emailed me the next day and I was taken care of on my next visit.The food and the sides it's always cook fresh. Unlike Longhorn where the vegetables and some other things are pretty prepared prior to serving.Overall is just a great value for the money if you're looking for a decent steak.
2	outback has gone so downhill its pathetic! got the new york strip last week & i would have been better off eating a burger at mcdonalds! thats it!
1	Horrible service upon arrival. 6 open tables and we were told it would be a 30 min wait because the hostesses said they didn't want to overwhelm their servers.  The three hostesses then went on to tell us the restaurant was so very busy and we didn't understand,  even though we were staring at a restaurant with several empty tables.  The hostesses were rude and condescending.  One hostess then went on to say our patronage as year round Arizonans didn't matter. No thank you Outback, we'll never visit again. Oh and we easily spend over $1,000 every year.
1	awful, service and everything, this place does not have CLAM CHOWDER at all.
2	You don't get more "Chain" restaurant than this!  Look at the dismal photo of my $9.99 steak and ice cream "scoop" shaped mashed potatoes?  If I didn't know it, I would have thought I was in a cafeteria!  Do you think Outback would seriously use this photo, of what you actually get, in their advertising?  Methinks not!Update:  My son got a hamburger and it was really good.  The manager also called me and they said they are updating their lunch menu in July and TWO sides will be offered, making the plate more appealing.  He said he would get rid of the "Ice cream scoop" shaped mashed potatoes too!  YEAH!!!!!!!!
1	Service here is suck!  Their waiting process is horrible and employee at front door need to be trained.
2	I've been going to this location for over 10 years and it's always been very good.  I'm not sure if they switched cooks or where they are getting their meats but my last two visits have been subpar to say the least.  If you're known as a steak place then learn how to cook a steak.  This sounds simple, right? On my last visit about a week ago I ordered a Porterhouse, baked potato and grilled asparagas. While waiting I ordered a half order of the Bloomin Onion pedels.  Should have skipped those, really greasy and not hot.  My steak came out on life support, the potato was so small I thought it was a raw onion and they burned my veggies.
3	Service was ok.  Server was friendly and the food was ok.  For the price I would rather have longhorn steakhouse food.
5	Love this place! Great value. Consistent quality. Victoria filet is my favorite with a blue cheese crown. Yum!
