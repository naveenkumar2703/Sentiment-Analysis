5	Dr. Perrine is an incredible chiropractor and acupuncturist who keeps the entire human system in view.   I have visited Dr. Perrine with several sports related injuries and have experienced great results.   Thank you!
5	Dr. Perrine is awesome - such a great guy and an excellent chiropractor.  I've seen him for several problems, and all of them have been corrected.  I had horrible sciatic pain during my last pregnancy, and he worked with me to correct the problem.  One of my ears was stopped up for a month, and I tried everything to fix it!  After a few acupuncture treatments, it opened up again.  Nothing else had worked!I highly recommend Dr. Perrine - whether you have a problem that needs to be fixed, or whether you want to improve your health - go see him!
1	I've never posted a negative in my life on anyone. However, I feel strongly about this.I went to Dr. Perrine for assistance with "many" health issues & Dr. Perrine personally assured me time after time, he "could" help me with a specialized diet for my goals & needs. He suggested I take specialized tests to determine what was going on to proceed. I agreed to these expensive tests-$1,400. That's not counting what my Insurance did cover for blood work that was beyond expensive for one blood test-avg-$350-400. After getting them back, he recommended products he sells & when I asked for a diet, there was NO diet for my needs. They worked with Metagenics, however, it was for weight Loss & not specificially for me, personally. Staff reached out to Metagenics, only to find out, they couldn't assist me. They attempted to make a diet for me, that I knew wasn't right. I had it reviewed by Medical professionals & glad I trusted myself & MD. I would've gotten worse, had I done this. I'm now paying for a long time on tests, his office was to assist me with. Lesson learned. If you want help, be sure you know what you are getting in to LT.
