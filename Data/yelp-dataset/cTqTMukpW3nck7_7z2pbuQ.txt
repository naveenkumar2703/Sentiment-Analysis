3	Lots of choices met us when we walked into Cheeburger Cheeburger. On the hamburger menu there's about 10 different cheeses and 15 toppings. They have a huge Italian syrup bar and they'll add a mix to any soda or iced tea.The food was good, but unless you live in south Chandler, I wouldn't make the drive if you have a favorite in your neighborhood.
4	Burgers were very good...just be careful when you order a side of fries or onion rings...  WAY too much for 1 person!
3	Visiting Chandler we were kind of pressed to find some place good to eat for lunch. My brother recommended Cheeburger Cheeburger and it was a pleasant surprise. Ultimately: The food was pretty delicious, and if based on food alone I would give it a 4 star rating. There are several little nuances that bugged me which bring it down to a 3. The menu is pretty confusing. Without any easy to order preconfigured options, it can be a pretty intimidating venture for a first-time customer. The food takes a little bit of time to cook, like 10+ minutes even during a relatively unbusy time like 3pm... which is pretty frustrating for burgers and fries. I'd prefer the buns to have sesame seeds, and they charge extra for bacon which I wish was a lot more crisper than how they cook it by default. If you order sides (which are huge but tasty), expect to pay greater than $10 per person. My brother got the patty melt, which looked like a pound of meat and was HUGE. In the end, this place's food is pretty solid. My main complaint is what you get for the cost, which makes the little nit-picky things venture into the realm of annoying and unpleasant.
3	***Closed***This place wasn't bad but it is always sad to see a locally owned eatery close up shop.
2	CLOSEDBut probably for good reason, the place was not well kept. I distinctly remember the carpet stains throughout. The burgers were pretty good. I recommend the closest alternate location at Tempe Marketplace, but service was not stellar on my last visit.
