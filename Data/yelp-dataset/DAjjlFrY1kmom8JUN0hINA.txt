3	This Circle K I'm guessing is one of the 1st in Gilbert judging by how the building looks. Friendly people and good coffee.
4	Staff is friendly and nice, Store is always clean. It's a gas station so you can't expect much. But this is the closest gas station to my house so I am here often no matter the time of the day or night.
2	No hotdogs on the rollers.... FAIL. Circle K has few expectations but gas, coffee, and hotdogs are a must for a five star rating.
