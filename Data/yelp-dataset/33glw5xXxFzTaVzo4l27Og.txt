5	I love Elizabeth's Moments of Joy!! I would give this business 6 stars if I could!I contacted Elizabeth and ordered a collection of cookies and whoopie pies for my graduation party. I was definitely not disappointed in the quality and everyone loved them! Way better than Sprinkles (gross!). Her whoopie pies (basically a cupcake sandwich) are the most amazing things! The flavor is indescribable! I would say my ultimate favorite is her smore whoopie pie, seriously tastes just like a smore. Amazing! Her cookies are fabulous and the scones are a happy twist on a classic scone (not dry at all). I would say my fave cookie so far is the Sweet & Salty Butterscotch, although I can honestly say I have not had a bad cookie from her. Long story kind of short... if you are looking for amazing tasting baked goods that you don't have to slave over yourself, then look no further. I will definitely be adding this to my list of gift ideas from now on!
5	Absolutely delicious twisted scones! My taste buds cheered when I ate the Death NY Cinnamon scones!!!
5	I usually find the baked goods at the Gilbert farmer's market.  I thought they only made cookies but today I discovered the gluten free lemon raspberry whoopee pie.  I did my best to make last through the day, but I could not resist.  It was amazing!!   Enough for me to look this site up and find the location so I could buy another!!
