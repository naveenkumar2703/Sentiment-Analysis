5	This is the BEST yarn shop I have been to in a LONG time!!! The staff are AMAZING (Elizabeth and Terry where there that day) and were so kind and helpful. I was visiting from out of state, and try to hit local yarn shops when I travel. The selection was really nice, but honestly the Elizabeth made the experience top notch! She showed me cute new patterns I would not have thought of and we bonded over patterns we had in our Ravelry library! I LOVE this store and will for sure come back!
4	The staff are very knowledgeable and helpful.  They carry much better quality of yarn and supplies than the chain stores but the cost is higher, too.  They have classes and will help you if you take a project in you are working on.  I think they have knitting groups as well.  Oh, and I love stores with especially good lighting, natural or other!  My poor old eyes need all the help they can get!  Be sure to look around at all the pretty samples to inspire you!
4	I took their crochet class here. They didn't have a time that worked for me but they let me set up a time that worked as long as I brought two other people and it was still open to the public which was nice. We had one other girl join us. The class was okay a couple of us just needed a refresher but the one person who had never done it really struggled. The store does a really nice job of explaining yarn and needles when you go in and you can but materials before the class or bring them in.
