3	Normally I get a veggie sub.  Today, since most every sub is $5, I had a foot long turkey breast sub.  Really, you can't go wrong with Subway unless the bread is all stale or the meats are old.  But neither was old or bad.  It was good.Turkey on honey oat with swiss.  Spinach, olives, jalapenos, banana peppers, and red onions.  Also sweet onion sauce and splcy mustard.  Bomb.....
4	Subway is Subway. Like the 1st review said, the only time it's bad is when the bread is stale or old meat. This particular Subway is batting 1.000 so far. Plus, it's right next to my work.
4	Subway is my secret guilty pleasure...and so is the meatball sandwich. Tuna  is my next go to me hungry get in my tummy sandwich.
5	This is the Subway by my house.  I go to lots of different Subways around the valley so I feel like I have a good basis of comparison when I say this one deserves 5 stars.  First of all, it's always SUPER clean.  I love that.  Second, the staff are friendly and responsive, not to mention the fact that there's not a lot of staff turnover.  The staff make good choices - honestly, I've been at other Subways where I'll say "just a little light mayo" and they layer it on in a blanket, make a big mess out of it when I ask them to remove some of it, then wrap my sandwich up with their hands a big mayo-y mess so that my sandwich and the papers it's wrapped in are a trainwreck.  That would never happen at this Subway.  Also, the staff will banter with each other AND with customers in a very friendly appropriate way.  Another time, I came in to buy gift cards and there was a bit of a snafu with it.  It was no big deal and the situation was resolved, but none-the-less the owner gave me an extra gift card for a free 6" for my trouble - so unnecessary but it illustrates what a great Subway location this is.
