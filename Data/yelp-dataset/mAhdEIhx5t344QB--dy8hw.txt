4	As with most high calibre sound systems, the quality will leave you amazed but the price will have you grimacing. Because of this, the likes of James Morrow will never see me spend a penny in store: definitely a shop for the high income band.James Morrow sells some impressive Hi-FI and entertainment gear, but be prepared to spend if you want to walk out with any one item.
4	This is one of two truly high end entertainment shops in the area (Bang & Olufsen being the other), although this one tends to focus more on the hi-fi area than overall entertainment.   It's not cheap here, what you are buying is top end goods, so of course it won't be cheap.When you've decided what it is you want you entertainment system to achieve and how much it is you want to spend on it head here and tell the staff what it is you want (unless you know your stuff of course) and they should be able to help you out.A visit to both here and Bang & Olufsen should get you what you want at a competitive price.
4	Oh my, oh my, it's Hi-Fi porn in here. There's a turntable in the window (I'm into vinyl, music snob and all that), which is on a perspex base and it looks incredible. Irrespective of the sound quality, I want it. I can't afford it, but there's no harm in dreaming.This is, as the others have said, high end stuff in here. But when it comes to quality hi-fi equipment, you really do get what you pay for. Being that type of store, the staff are extremely knowledgeable and only too happy to help, even if they quickly realise you're a poor student without a hope of affording anything in there.If you are like me, in crushing penury, then it's a little torturous going in here, because you will want to possess everything. If you're not on a budget, though, this should be your first stop for high-end goods.
