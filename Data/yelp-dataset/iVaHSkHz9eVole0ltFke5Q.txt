5	These guys are cool. I as looking for some take off part for a sportster I am working on and I could not find them anywhere. I had driven past this place a ton of times and always see sportsters out front. I stopped in on Thursday and meet who I think is the owner Scott. I told him what I needed and he went in the back and came out with it. He gave me a price but I didn't have enough cash he saved the stuff in the back for me until I could come back. I went back this morning and pick up my stuff plus some other stuff I needed that he also had. The guys there this morning were also cool. This is a old school bike shop where you can walk in tell the guys what you want and they know what you are talking about!
3	Good prices on bikes and seem to be realatively straight up and honest.  Though I bought a bike there rode it 4 miles down the road and it died (condenser), called Scott told about it and he basically said, "like oh well" bring it in and we will fix it for a price.  It was a simple fix on my part but it is the principal of the thing.
5	Great place for getting parts and honest advice. I haven't had my bike serviced there, but have bought parts from Scott. I once called to order parts from him I thought I needed, and after talking to him for a few minutes he told me to not buy them and that I could actually fix my problem without them. He was right and it saved me some $$. The difference is that he took the time to talk to me about my bike, and even lost a sale in the end. But he gained a returning customer for sure.
5	Just had my biked repaired here. Scott (the owner) is an excellent mechanic, very straight forward, and honest. RSC is now my go to place for all repairs!
