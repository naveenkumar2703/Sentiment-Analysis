4	I happened to see a thrift store sign next to Cheers Bar and Robertos Taco shop as I was driving down Maryland Parkway last week, and knew I'd have to go check it out. I went on a Tuesday and discovered that they were open Thursday through Sunday, and vowed to return on Thursday. I was rewarded for my diligence.Although it's not a huge store, there's a variety of stuff packed in there, all at good prices. Much to my delight I found that used clothing was on sale a mere 25 cents a piece. I found wool blend skirt and jacket that I later dated to the late 60's. For 50 cents that's quite a score!There were a lot of books in labelled boxes, and some quality furniture. They also had new clothes with tags on, but I didn't really look at those too closely. As I was checking out I saw Elvis memorabilia and books behind the glass counter. I found a totally sweet 1941 interior decorating book, which I promptly purchased.
2	It is very small, cramped and smells like a mixture of old people and cigarettes. The selection of items was okay, I guess. Nothing to rave about. Some of their items were moderately priced, others not so much. I thought they might have some hidden gems to find in here but alas, they did not. It is truly just an average run of the mill not so cheap thrift shop.I wouldn't go out of my way to return.
5	Great store. Found a Pink computer chair $10, A wonderful home interiors 4 ft wall decoration $5, 2 red iron wall scones $5 each, and some shot  glasses for $1 each. 2 throw pillows $2 and they gave me $ off the total price. Nice girl working there also.
