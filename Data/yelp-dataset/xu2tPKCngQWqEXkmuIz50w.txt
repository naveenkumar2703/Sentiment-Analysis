4	Lovely little public park, which stands out among lots of parks in Edinburgh. Excellent children's play area, with a separate area for very small children, which is great. Lots of green as you'd expect, but a good astroturf football pitch and asphalt basketball area too (not kept well enough to be called a court, but still used quite often).Some of the play equipment in the older kids' area got burned recently, which is a real shame. Couple of people got beaten up in the evening too. The park attracts a bit of a hooligan element of an evening now, so I'd steer clear after dusk. Notwithstanding, it's still a lovely family area during the day.
4	Victoria Park has been refurbished and now has lighting to the main paths (work is finishing very soon to get them switched on..), lots of new trees planted and had a reall spruce up. New notice board inplace with info about plans and events. And a handsome memorial statue of Edward V11 .....in Victoria Park....following his visit to Edinburgh in 1903. Still a good choice for a stroll or a bit more energetic exrecise, to run / walk the dogs - plenty of bins for waste. Kids play areas fenced off - one for older kids with lots of equipment to have a shot at, and one for younger kids / toddlers to use in a nice and safe way. Large grassy area always popular for a kick about, and fenced b/ball & footy court too. Cycle paths take you to Leith under Ferry Road, and on to Warriston and the city. Pass through it to make up a circuit to Newhaven etc. It is also an occasional venue for some events such as cycling or running events. Locally, if you fancy some refreshment a couple of bars nearby - Victoria Park Hotel off Ferry Road, the Grandfield (the re-named Lobster Pot, or the Lobby as its known locally) just down Craighall Road, or for a hot snack in the hand, Johnstons excellent local store is a minute or two's walk along East Trinity Road with a good choice.
