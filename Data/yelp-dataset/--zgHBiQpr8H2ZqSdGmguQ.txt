4	This place is great. Second time there on Tuesday night. Came in around 10:30 PM & they close at 11. $14.99 per person I believe & I think it was the manager in blue was SO nice. Gave us free drinks! The bus boy on the other hand was so rude. Threw the straws for our drinks on the table & went off. Never once did he crack a smile. The food was good considering the fact that they were about to close so a lot of it was put away. Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt  for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !
2	Went by reviews on Yelp and this place was not good at all.  The lunch special had no different price and two of the buffet table were empty!  Food was bland and not much variety!  Try something else before going here.
