5	I absolutely love Dr. Pottgen.  She's been my sons pediatrician since he was born.  It's great to have consistency and have her there throughout his years.  He's familiar with her and he trusts her.  She always takes her time with us and answers any questions we may have.  If she doesn't have an answer, she finds out for us right away.  The facility is also nice. It's clean and has friendly ladies working at the front desk.  There are "sick" and "well" entrances which is nice in that it separate the kids who are sick and the ones who are there for regular check-ups.
5	I have not had a bad experience in 6 years. Always see a doctor who listens to my concern and finds the appropriate next step. Dr Pottgen is supportive and understanding as my primary care doctor. Again, every other Dr I have seen has been amazing and quick to resolve or refer us for additional services when necessary.While afternoon appointments can run late, try not to get too disturbed as you will soon be given first class care as well.Excellent service by 2 on-call Dr's when my children were born as well.
