4	Must get gas....kinda pricey but my car is dying...
1	I had a coupon to have my oil changed (just the oil) for $19.99.  When I got there the mechanic that greeted me tried immediately to "hard sell" me to purchase the full service for over $30.  When I told him I could only afford the special he got very dismissive and rude.  Actually told me "you will be out in less than 10 minutes"  When my car was done I paid another mechanic and left.  It was not until I got home did I realize that the receipt was on the floor in my car.  I read the receipt and it "seems" everything in my car was leaking, my oil, my transmission, and my power steering.  What's funny, is neither of the mechanics found it necessary to mention that to me.  What is also more interesting is IF my car was leaking from all of those areas, would not there be a leak in my clean garage on the floor?  On the floor where I park my car at work?  I had a friend check my car and he saw NO LEAKS at all.  I find this to be highly dishonest.  I wrote an email to complain about this so called service and told them I wanted my money back, but they insisted that they did a good job; and would NOT refund my money. I would never go there again, and I would suggest that you don't either.  With so many honest mechanics out there why use a dishonest one?    Their dishonest, rude and not respectful.  I have since had my oil changed at another place and surprise - surprise - I have NOTHING LEAKING in my car.
