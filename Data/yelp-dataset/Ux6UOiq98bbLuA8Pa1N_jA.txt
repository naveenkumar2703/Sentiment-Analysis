4	I am a huge fan of their store... They have great deals, for women, womens plus, shoes and kids!! I go about once or twice a month! I like that they have plus size for juniors and their shoes are sooooo cute and fun! They will be opening up a new shop off craig and rancho next to T.J Max and Bath and Body works!! I am very excited so i dont have to go in the ghetto... lol 4 stars because the cleanliness is not the best but i love the clothes :DAlso have military discount!!! :D Gotta love those who support our men and women of the country.
1	So when i first went into this store i thought it was great, they had super nice clothes at an affordable price for plus size.. but theres a reason the clothes is so cheap, after about a week of using their jeans the button fell off, the stiches are coming undone and the little design in the back is falling off, the shirt i bought has a hole in it, and my sisters dress, the top hem is coming off, very disappointed, had high hopes but they were crushed when all the clothes i bought fell apart! Would not ever buy from again and do not recommend to anyone unless you want an outfit for one or two nights!!
1	Worst shopping experience ever. The security guard was sitting on top of a ladder cursing while talking about soccer with a female worker.two boys that belong too one of the workers were running around like they were in a playground. Most unprofessional store ever.
