5	It's hard to find a shredding place that will take your personal documents at any time.  But these guys do - and for cheap!  $6-8 for a huge bag.  Staff was incredibly helpful and charming.  and when I dropped stuff off, the guy who took my bags asked if I wanted to watch it get shredded.  Not only is it just fun to watch - but I now have no worries that anyone there is looking through my stuff while it's waiting to be shredded.
5	Had 23lbs of paper to shred from cleaning out some filing cabinets.  They shredded it right there on the spot.  I paid $6 for what would be equal to 1 banker's box (according to their website)  I had it in a department store bag, which they even handed back to me.  Supper easy.  Glad I did it.  The local USP store said they would charge me $1.50 / lb so I saved at least $20 going to PDShred.
5	This place is awesome!  I had a really hard time finding a place in the East Valley that did confidential, secure shredding of personal documents. I am so happy I found PdShred - they were friendly, courteous, informative, inexpensive and available without an appointment.  Plus you can watch to make sure your docs are shredded!  I had 3 banker's boxes - $6.00 each - perfect for safe destruction of personal information.  And they recycle what has been shredded.  I cannot recommend them enough.
5	I use them a few times a year. They have moved around a little between Tempe and Mesa. Each time I have use their services I have been very well pleased. I'm getting ready to use them again in a few weeks I'm expecting great service.
5	I was looking for an economical way to shred some private papers and I am so happy I found this business on Yelp. I agree with the other reviewers! Excellent, friendly service and just $6 for a box of papers. It was fun to watch how they did it. I will bring more items here if I need to, and I definitely recommend  this business!
