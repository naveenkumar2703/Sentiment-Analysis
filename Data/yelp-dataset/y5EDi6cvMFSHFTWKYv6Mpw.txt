5	Youll find this place nested in the corner where Mercer Ln meets 71st (just north of Shea off of Scottsdale Rd). Its got a very basic boutique set up, but carries some very nice pieces from some very talented designers both local and otherwise.I came here for a trunk show last week, and will definitely be back. John was super nice and very personable, as was his cohort Heidi whos building a Mary Kay training center in the back portion of the boutique. When I made my purchase, I received a $10.00 off coupon for the next time I come in. John explained that everytime someone makes a purchase theyll receive that as an incentive to come back (great idea!).I wish John all the luck w/ this place! Stop in and say hi (and check out the pieces from Shawl Dawls in LA- love those gals!).
5	BEST STORE IN AZ! The owner is very helpful, loves to help his customers. This store is the definition of good customer service!
5	This store is closing so I went in and everything was on sale. I bought a really cute dress. They have some beautiful designers and great, trendy clothing. I love it!!
