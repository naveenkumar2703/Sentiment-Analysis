5	I had an AMAZING experience from the moment I called to inquire about the producer, until the moment I was helped to my car after surgery. I had to have, my one and only wisdom tooth removed and I was very nervous, to say the least. EVERYONE went out of their way to ease my anxiety. The front desk was VERY friendly, we started on time, my nurses were SO sweet and made me feel comfortable asking the hundreds of questions that were running through my head. Dr. Lamb came in shortly after, listened to all my concerns, went over all the pros and cons, and spent a lot of time communicating with me to make sure I understood what would be taking place from start to finish. He was very kind and made me feel like he really cared. Once I woke up, after surgery,  another nurse helped me to my car and he was very kind and caring as well. I got a phone call from Dr. Lamb a few hours later to check in on my recovery and to answer any new questions I had at that point. A huge THANK YOU to Dr. Lamb, Brad, Lisa, Gina, Kelly, Brittany, and Christina for making my experience a great one!! I will recommend this office to EVERYONE I know!!
5	I had my 4 wisdom teeth removed by Dr Lamb. The whole process was full of care. I didn't feel too much pain and the recovery was good. Dr Lamb called me later to follow up. He is a very knowledgeable and skillful doctor. Take very good care of his patients.
5	The whole team at Dr. Lamb's office is awesome! I had all four of my wisdom teeth done. Dr. Lamb called later that day to follow up and make sure I was feeling okay. I had a little bit of pain on one side a few days later, and they were great about getting me in very quickly on my lunch break. Thank you!
