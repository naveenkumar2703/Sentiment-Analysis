3	Surprisingly clean and staff is pretty helpful.
4	I must say this one is cleaner than the nellis location. The prices seem to be cheaper but the selection isn't as great. For drinks they had soda and sunny d that's it. Other locations have everything from apple juice to zebra juice lol. I wouldn't go out of my way when the nellis one is closer but I am impressed with the cleanliness. And the employees are helpful.
5	I give it five stars. The store is clean. The employees are nice and the prices are cool. Fast service with a smile. How can anyone dislike this I give it five stars.
