4	I have loved J Crew forever .. FOREVAHHHHH... And this store gets my 4 for being friendly.. last year I bought a little black dress for the Nascar Champions event in the NYC..I saw it in the window and no size 4 to be had.. The sales girl said shed have it in less than 24.. to my home, no less.. Ive been a fan of this particular J Crew ever since.. But for me, Id be hard pressed to NOT like something J Crew--ish... I love the cardigans.. the little dresses.. the umbrellas.. (better in use on the East than in the West).. and I have a thing for the headbands.. for my long locks.. every winter they come out with J Crew jammies.. stock up.. I like this store better than the one in Fashion Square.. they are just nicer:-)
3	I first started shopping at J Crew in the late 90s.  My fashion sense was evolving and I began to shed my Timberland's and Clark Wallabee's for loafers and Banana Republic.Back then, J Crew was higher priced but offered a better selection of items and had a better finish than BR.  I don't know what's happened in the last 10 years, but J Crew seems more like a dressed up Eddie Bauer than a mid-level brand.There were so many plaid shirts in the men's section as well as thermals and v-necks in several colorways.  Not one thing caught my attention at this store.  Now bear in mind, I had just left BR and their AMAZING sale section.  In comparison, the J Crew sale section paled...PALED.I do like the fact that they offer a discount to students and teachers.  But not enough to make any purchases.And believe me, I looked (a few times)...
