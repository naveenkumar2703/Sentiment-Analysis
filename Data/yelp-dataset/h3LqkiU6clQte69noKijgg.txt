5	I noticed this new shop on yelp and decided to call up and find out what they where all about.... And the person that answered the call was especially helpful!....So I drove all the way from Anthem in Henderson to check them out.... They have a really cool look it's new, nice flooring and a sweet counter too, really nice custom seats at the bar, and a nice lounge and big flat panels on the wall!... I tried a few juices got a good deal swapped some vape story's and found a great new spot to hang out... Go check them out it's totally worth the trip:)
5	#1 for Vegas and my vapor needs in my opinion. Stopped by for the first time from Los Angeles and had a great selection for just being open for a week! Came back with a magnet upgrade for my nemesis. Nirvana juice and a build that plumes! Thanks plume factory, I'll be back next time I'm in town.
5	Awesome atmosphere! Great people! Good pricing!
