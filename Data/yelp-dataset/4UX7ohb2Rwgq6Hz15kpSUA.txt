3	Coach stores obviously sell Coach bags, scarves, wallets and other Coach accessories. One of the employees greeted me as I entered but didn't try to help me past that.  I was looking for a specific bag I'd seen on a friend during the week, but didn't find it here. This is one of the smallest Coach stores I've been in...not a whole lot here. If you want a Coach bag or other accessory, I'd recommend the Coach Factory store in Anthem, AZ for two reasons: 1. The prices are MUCH more bearable, and2. MUCH larger selection!
1	I spend an obscene amount of money on luxury items each year and Coach is just one of the stores I frequent but this location was rubbish.  The employees were rude and pushy and tried to upsell me on everything!!  When making my purchase, I was asked about the leather cleaner which I graciously declined and was taunted, "it's only $10, if you are spending xxx on a purse, you can't afford another $10".  I almost walked out.  Had I not already given my card I would have left my purchase and walked out I was so upset.  Never again.  I will stick to the locations that aren't hard up to sell something so I can be treated decently.
5	I had a great experience at this store. The gal that helped me was super nice and extremely helpful, but not pushy at all. I was greeted when I came in the store, and told to ask if I had questions, but when she saw I was seriously looking for something specific, she came over and helped. I also got a hand-written thank you note after I made my purchase. I really appreciated the personal touch.
