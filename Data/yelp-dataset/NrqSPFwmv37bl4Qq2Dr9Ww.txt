5	Loooove this spot! We always come here when we don't feel like driving all the way to Scottsdale for hookah. It's conveniently located in Glendale and close to a lot of popular restaurants. So, after we consume thousands of calories - we stop by and smoke hookah, listen to music and relax. They serve their hookahs out of apple heads (soooo good!) and constantly bring you charcoal. side note:  I've never had a hookah that didn't last more than two hours. If anybody smokes hookah, you know that is RARE to get.
1	One star for the service. Not a fan of a clubby hookah lounge. I prefer a chill, kick back with pool tables and a relaxing feel. Too loud, I could barely hear myself think, and the bathrooms are nasty.
5	By far the best hookah lounge I've been to. Atmosphere and service are fantastic. The staff is so friendly and will be sure to take care of you. They make the hookah themselves and it always tastes great.
