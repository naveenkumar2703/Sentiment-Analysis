5	I followed Ashley from JCP Salon. Amazing! Thank you sooo much! Best haircut ever! Adorable feather extentions!Ashley cut my hair (awesome!) Kelly did my feather extentions (soo cute!)Two thumbs up! I highly recommend :)
5	I came here after buying an awesome deal on Weekly Deals ($30 for $120 worth of services) and was SO happy with my experience! Amanda did an amazing job on my cut and color... even better than I could have imagined! She was friendly, professional, and went above and beyond my expectations! If I wasn't moving away from the Phoenix area, I would definitely continue to come here - wish I would have found them awhile ago!
5	Went there for threading and Dayana did a great job.  She is the first person in AZ that  I'm going back to see.  She didn't rush, I didn't have to show her sections she missed, and she's not in a mall.  Well worth the trip to Scottsdale.
5	Love my hair.
4	I purchased a HomeRun voucher for a haircut and color with Kelly. I called to schedule my appointment about a month after my purchase, and Amanda was very helpful and accommodating. When I arrived on Saturday afternoon, I was greeted by Kelly and only had to wait a few minutes before she was ready for me. She asked me specifically what I wanted and listened to my precise specifications (I'm picky about my hair, but what woman isn't?). I wanted the slightest trim possible and a brighter ombre color which I already had done, but was fading quickly. My style and color came out beautifully! I would have chosen 5 stars if it weren't for the salon itself. It's just one very small room, and it gives off a super cramped vibe. Other than that, I highly recommend Kelly!
3	It's great to find a brow threader in my hood and Dayana did a great job.   I can't grade this place any higher since I've been here just once. The actual place was hard to find since the door was jammed and I thought it was locked since I came here on a Sunday.  Dayana works on Sundays only.
