4	This is my local Thai restaurant and I pop down just as often as I can. It's a simple case of good honest Thai home cooking in a friendly atmosphere. I can tend to be a creature of habit but recently I've tried to change my tune and order across the menu. The high standard remains the same whether it's massaman curry with chicken, jungle curry with pork or my favourite som-tam (green papaya salad). They now offer food to take-away too which makes a refreshing change from the usual hit-or-miss chinese options I tend to use on a Friday night.
4	Chiang Mai is a good Thai restaurant in Haymarket which offers authentic cooking at decent prices.  Apparantly it used to have a pretty bad reputation for serving sub-standard dishes and having poor service.  Thankfully, it's straightened itself out and when I was in last month I had a tasty meal with some friends and a good overall experience.  The menu is a little confusing and I went for the Thai red curry which didn't take long to arrive and tasted delicious when it did.  My meal was pretty spicy, but my mate ordered marinated squid which was one of the hottest things we had all tasted!! Some people aren't into spicy food and if you're one then it'd pay to be careful as you scan the menu in here.Chiang Mai does have its faults, but it offers tasty food with friendly service.
2	I've been here a few times, each time forgetting the slow service and rather bland Thai cuisine on offer here at not particularly impressive prices. Conveniently located close to Haymarket Station, but I'd wander further afield if you want some above average Thai cuisine at the same price level.
