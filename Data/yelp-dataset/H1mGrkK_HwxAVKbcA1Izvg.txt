3	I had no trouble finding the place as I have been to Salon Boutique many times for other services.  I do not mind the room or that it is not too spaish.  During the massage your eyes are closed anyways.  Only once (towards the end of my massage) did I hear any external noise from outside the room.I liked having unscented lotion, I guess just a personal preference.  Char got right to work on me when I arrived.  I filled out the paperwork ahead of time as it was attached on her website.  She was very professional during the whole massage.  However, it definitely was not the best massage I have ever had.  She added in extra fluff: doing the karate chops and fingers down the body.  I have had other 90 min massages and they have gone better than this one without the fluff.  It wasn't bad but I am glad I did not pay full price.Char was nice and the place was clean.  She used 3 sheets/blankets so I felt very comfortable.  She was the first massage therapist that actually massaged the bum out from under the sheets.  Most usually do it with the sheets on.  Guess it really does not matter.  She made sure I was properly covered throughout the entire service.  She did not do any extra talking which I prefer.  I do not see myself going back anytime soon but I say if you have a deal at least give her a shot.  I had a LivingSocial one.
