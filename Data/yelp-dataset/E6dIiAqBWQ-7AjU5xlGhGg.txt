4	Robek's is yummy.  They've got me addicted to what ever they call their concoction with OJ, Strawberries, Blueberries, frozen yogurt, and I get soy protein and/or vitamins added.They are a little higher priced than Jamba, but they taste way better.Jamba's vitamin add-in always makes my smoothies taste like one of my high-school science teachers always smelled -- like alternating between sticking your nose in a freshly opened bottle of vitamins and and in an old lady's butt --  but Robek's doesn't taste like that; their's is good.The staff always gives you a friendly hello, the second you walk through the door, the ultra-promptness of which makes it seem a bit fake at times.  Service is pretty quick and efficient for a smoothie joint.Never had the food, but they offer very limited assortment of prepacked sandwiches.If you're cheap like me, watch for BOGO smoothie coupons in the newpaper circulars a few times a year.
4	If you are a calorie counter, this is the place to grab a filling drink. Less than 300 calories for a medium smoothie that will hold over any appetite (I'm a big dude) the prices might be a little high, but well worth it for the once in awhile visit.
4	Pretty darn good smoothies, pricey but worth it for sure. I'm not a huge fan of smoothie places overall, but this one is worth stopping by every once in a while. :)
