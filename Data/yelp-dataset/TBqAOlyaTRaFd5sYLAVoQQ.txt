5	I love these stores.  I have been to many.  GREAT options for pizza.  Take it home, bake it yourself.  Hot and fresh out of the oven. This was a newer location.  Much easier than my other location in Apache Junction. And they have some new menu options. Try it.  You won't order delivery again.
5	My new favorite pizza!  Hot out of my own oven.
4	While I sat waiting for my Cowboy to be ready....pizza that is- I noticed a young gentlemen I think should be mentioned, unfortunately I didn't catch his name. As he made pizzas he took time to respond and greet  customers, I watched as he spoke  to a small child and made him smile! Young or old that kind of service isn't seen often enough,service with a smile goes a long way! He made at least two customers smile, and this customer will definitely be back! :)
