5	What a beautiful course!  Lucky to get to play here with a great member and a couple of other friends.  The course was absolutely beautiful and in perfect condition.  Dan was a great forecaddy as well.  Staff was courteous and I hope to play again!  You can't go wrong here and I would rate it right up there with Shadow Creek.
4	Let me say this... This should be a 5 Star rating as the Robert Trent Jones Sr. layout is truly spectacular in every aspect.  Its a private club that allows some other private club Recipricol play and we had 8 of us today on this gorgeous Friday in Las Vegas. Arrive to a gated tremendous looking clubhouse that is top shelf all the way.  Check in and are told that 1 credit card for all on course food & beverage charges will be collected than we will settle up with that one person.. Truly not an issue but since its private it has its policies. Down to the expansive driving range where we hit some balls then head to the putting green to roll a few.  Was told they punched the greens two / three weeks ago and normally they are like rocks and roll like ice / glass.  Unfortunately they are not back from their aerofication. Caddies are mandatory and after hitting some balls our caddy is shall I say "off" a little spaced out and completely looking like he is somewhere else.  Caddy master was happy to replace him.  Course it self is magnificent layout, manicured, and truly spectacular views and vistas that are unmatched.  Greens were not as expected but playable but at over $400.00 to play yes I am quite happy to be able to get on here. but it was a bit of a disappointment.  Lunch at the turn was good and remember to turn your cell phones off here as they have a strict NO PHONE USE Policy here.  GOOD FOR THEM.All and all take the caddy out of the equation and play here when greens are tip top Im sure my update will be 5 Stars.
