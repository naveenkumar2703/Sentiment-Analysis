5	Amanda is so amazing our pictures are so beautiful. I was really impressed with her communication and planning. She went over different poses and styles with me via email and found the best location for us, that coordinated with our attire. She gave great direction on how to pose and if we needed to move a hand or my hair needed fixed. She really cared about outcome of our photos. We will be using her from now on and I recommend her to anyone needing a photos!
5	I trusted Amanda with my newborn photos of my son in December 2013. She came to my house with all the tools to make my newborn photos perfect including a space heater to keep him warm when naked. She took time to hear my requests. We got all the shots to capture my precious newborn. She'll be photographing him every few months as my little guy grows up. You can trust Amanda.
5	Amanda did our family photos shortly before Christmas this year and was truly wonderful.  She recommended a beautiful site and was prepared on the day of to manage and make comfortable my reluctant four-year-old.  My one-year-old was so shy and fussy, but Amanda worked with us so professionally, and I honestly couldn't believe, with the baby being so difficult, how wonderful her photos turned out.  I don't know how she did it, but they were excellent!  Us will definitely be calling Happily Ever After for our photos in the future!
5	Amanda did out family photos, newborn photos and my other sons 2 year portrait. She was very patient with my toddler and we were happy with all out photos. She was even able to bring everything to do the newborn photos indoors. I will be using her again.
