3	Finally seeing this place on a Fri and Sat night and I like this place. Stella on tap and for $2.25?!? I'm sold! Music is hip hop to top 40. It's definitely a girl club with more of the hip hop scene as opposing to Cash. I really dig the small smoke section with tv on wall, fans, and pool table. The bar tenders are so sweet! The employees are all very laid back and friendly. You can show up dressy or plain old T and either way you won't be out of place. $2 cover on Fri/Sat on nights where a drag show may be held. I've never been here past 10pm, so the review is based on a pre game setting before the crowd is in.
1	You can't polish a turd!  When will these ladies understand that?!  Just because you change your name from Z Girl Club to Zoan and spruce the place up a bit, doesn't change the fact that you are still tacky and totally uncool.
1	Zoan you treated us decent the couple times we visited, but tonight we had to yelp you... The drinks were wack and watered down. AND your security swept/mopped our feet as we did the Cupid shuffle.... How RUDE!!! Almost certain we won't return...
5	Always fun! Friendly staff gay and lesbian welcome. Smoke room. Pool tables, darts, great dance floor!fabulous music and great drink specials
1	RACIST STAY AWAY FROM HERE!!!  I went here Saturday night and was not let in.  I'm Black with a big afro.  They looked at me funny and ignored me while I was in line.  They let all the white people on line inside.  All the Black people were left outside.  Totally wrong!!
