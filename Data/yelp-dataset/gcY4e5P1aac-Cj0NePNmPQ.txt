3	My old boss looooooved this place.  Loooooved.  Once or twice a week she wanted to go there for lunch.  I was new and my job and I wanted to kiss ass, so I went along with her.Anyone who's read my reviews have probably surmised by now that I love Mexican food. I'm going to be moving to New York City sooner rather than later and, let me tell you, I'm going to miss me some really good Mexican food.  Taco Ole is....eh.  Their house salsa is tasty and therefore their chips and salsa would rock if the chips didn't taste like they'd been sitting in old grease for a few weeks.  Same thing with their tacos - there just seems to be an old grease problem going on, and I don't mean John Travolta.  (Oh man, Travolta burn, I wasn't expecting that one.)   Their cheese enchiladas are really good though; they make a pretty good enchilada sauce.Ole's not bad for a lunch spot if you're so inclined and it's near and you stay away from anything fried.  The rabid love for this place that some people have, though, I'll never understand.
3	Nothing special, nothing bad--just a decent little taqueria.  I tried a chicken taco and a taco al pastor (spicy pork), and the chicken taco stood out as particularly flavorful.  Nothing was greasy at 10:30 AM when I stopped for "breakfast"; they were just frying the chips at that hour.  Prices are definitely low--I got out for less than $4 including a tall glass of horchata.
3	Decent good taqueria, about average for hole in the wall places. Had the torta with al pastor and horchata. The horchata was so/so, the torta was good.
