4	I lived in this hotel for about 3 weeks.  I have a relationship with this hotel so it's fair to say that the rating is based on our brief love affair.  I rated this hotel a 4 based on the fact that everyone that works there is 100% customer service focused, they took the time to learn my name and were always friendly.   This hotel provided me with the things I NEEDED, not wanted. I had a shuttle to and from work and they were always on time.  They had a fridge in the room for me to keep some bevarages, a fitness center, a laundry room and breakfast every morning. It is a clean and up to date. It doesn't provide any frills but the people make up for that. Its super easy to book a room and cancel it. And I have had to make many reservations for myself and co-workers .......not one was messed up.
3	The Destination Inn is full of high tech lost soles and I am one when I'm there. It's fine. It has a gym with two treadmills and a few weights and a pool with a Jacuzzi in the basement. There is free breakfast every morning, which is OK too. The free wifi is OK, it comes a goes on the higher floors.  The staff is nice enough. The destination Inn isn't fun, it's not exciting, but it is OK. Which can be better than terrible, which you can get in Waterloo.
4	This is a nice hotel for Waterloo.  Our visit was with our two girls ages 3 and 5.  They loved it.  The pool was nice and breakfast was good for a continental breakfast.  The rooms are smaller but clean.
