5	My wife and I have been to Good Times 3x in the past month.  The previous restaurant was Fitch's Chop house (which lasted about 9 months and was an upscale steak place).  The look and feel of the inside is that of a steak house (which was what it was).  Lots of wood on the walls. They offer karaoke on Friday and Saturday nights starting at 10PM.  They have a large game room for the kids with tickets for prizes.  They have a wide menu of food, but keep in mind the kitchen is only open until 10PM.Friday night is 2 dollar domestic taps (at least when I was there) and 2.50 for Jack mixers.  On a typical Friday/Saturday night you will find the bar area filled with 20-30 somethings professionals kicking back for a meal and a drink.It is a great place and offers lots of fun things to do and they even have open WiFi which is a plus for me!
1	The food is inconsistent and the service is terrible.  No reason to go - ever.
3	Good but not great.  I have yet to have a problem with service.  I probably wouldn't visit the place if it wasn't for the HUGE game room.  We have an 8 year old and this is a big treat for him.  From a kids perspective i would give the place 5 stars.
