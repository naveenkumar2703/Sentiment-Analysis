2	I can't believe I'm writing a review for Kohl's...Caution: this store is really small. I couldn't find much variety there. They had really good clearance racks, but that is always hit or miss.It's not that bad, but I would go to one of the other two in Madison before this one.
5	I love this store!
3	A Kohl's is a Kohl's is a Kohl's. I really don't have much to add here. I went to this store by chance has I needed to stock up on some warmer clothes. I was impressed with the sale that they had going on; on the same hand the selection was fairly limited.The staff was very friendly and helpful and there was plenty of parking. I would not be opposed to going back.
3	I'm writing this review for one simple reason - I hate, hate, hate how much pressure Kohl's(and some other stores) put on customers to sign-up for crap after purchase. Do you have a Kohls card?Would you like a Kohls card?Really? You'd save $5.Are you sure?Really? Ok.-- Now imagine having this dialogue every single time. It's like an annoying disclaimer in a movie that you can never skip and constantly have on repeat. I've even answered before sarcastically that I prefer to only pay full price for everything. I know the employees are instructed to do this but its just so annoying for myself that I have actually not gone because its just so irritating. You already have my money - take it!
