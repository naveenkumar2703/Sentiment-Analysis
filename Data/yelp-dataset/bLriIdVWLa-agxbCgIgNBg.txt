5	This was such a great experience :)). I even learned a few tips I could take into my own home. I was so comfortable and relaxed in the environment which can sometimes be rare at other places. This is definitely a place to go! :))
5	Erik is not just a regular massage person,   He does a wonderful job customizing his services to your needs.  He has a location he works out of, but he will also come to you.  This is so good for someone who suffers from being able to move and get out of the house.  He is clean and professional and is a master in his trade.     I recommend that you give him a try and stop supporting the cookie cutter/box shop membership based massage places!  Erik has what they have plus more!
5	I was fortunate to meet Erik at a local business network meeting. Erik is a wonderful masseuse and takes the time to work out any issues in the tissue and muscles. In my case I tend to hold in a lot of stress therefore I experience knots and inflammatory pain. The place was very clean and Erik made sure I was comfortable the whole time. He will certainly build a strong client base because he has a passion for healing people.
