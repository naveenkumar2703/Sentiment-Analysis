4	Yeah, OK Food City, as a store, pales in comparison to Ranch Market. I'm putting this review up, for one simple redemption.  Pollo Asado.  I've tried it from pretty much every outlet in the East Valley, including El Pollo Supremo, but the Pollo Asado from the parking lot grill at this Food City location is chicken NIRVANA. It's marinated in Orange juice, and spices, and is always hot, juicy, and fresh. Not overly salty, never dried out, or funky, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO, for Pollo Asado, in Mesa!  Also, their bakery is pretty good, not nearly as grand as Ranch Market's but Food City does have pretty amazing donuts :)
4	Come on!!! It's Eddy's best store. Why pay more at his others??? ok so carne asada, tortillas, their little restaurant & bakery. all around goodness. oh yeah! The grilled chicken is bomb! sometimes those little peppers can be hot so get plenty of horchata to soften the blow
1	My roommate and I came in to exchange $11 in coins so we could put that in their SRP billing machine for electricity. The cashier and the store manager we spoke to were VERY rude to us, and forced us to use the coinstar instead of accepting the coins we had already bagged into individual dollar amounts. I understand not exchanging the coins for people who bring in giant jars or bottles, but all the had to do was confirm each bag had a dollar in it, it took us longer to use the coinstar and (because coinstars eat your coins and charge you for every dollar you put in) we ended up only getting less than $9 back for which we still had to go to the rude cashier to get in cash. Food city may have cheap grocery prices, but they certainly don't care about their customers. Will not return.
