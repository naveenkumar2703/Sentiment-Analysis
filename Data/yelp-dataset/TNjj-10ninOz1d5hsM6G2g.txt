4	I am glad the place I bought my bike closed down.  It pushed me in to finding a bike shop that actually stocked accessories and stuff and knows what service is all about instead of the bike shop that was on my way home.  I don't ride very many miles so most of my needs as of late have been tire fixes.  They are fast and reasonable.  And have answered my questions about other issues right away no matter whom I have talked to.  And they have business hours a working person can deal with.  I intend to keep coming back here!
4	I got to talk with "Crazy Ken", he is a great guy and kept encouraging me to go group riding which i will do. I literally came in to burn time, but to be honest i had the best experience i ever had in a bike shop. No one gave me snobby looks, he listened to my confusion and self proclaimed cluelessness for what i was really doing. He helped me out a lot. We got to talk a lot about my bike, and i am pretty sure i want this to be "My bike shop".
5	The lady behind the counter was awesome. Will definitely be going back for all our biking needs!
1	I'm sorry to say, but Bike Den, at least in this location has closed down.
