5	I have been using Sin City Citations for well over a year now and I have to say the service is outstanding. I want to thank the business as a whole for the great work they do and Lisa in particular who goes above and beyond. Thank YouRomano.
5	This place is great!  After getting a ticket, a coworker referred me to Sin CIty Citations.  All I had to do was call, give them some info off of the ticket...then, they gave me an estimate date for when I should keep an eye in the mail.  My ticket got reduced to a parking violation and I just had to pay that fee through the mail (or online).  SUper easy.  Friendly staff...will use again if I HAVE to(but hopefully not).  I will definitely refer them to friends.
