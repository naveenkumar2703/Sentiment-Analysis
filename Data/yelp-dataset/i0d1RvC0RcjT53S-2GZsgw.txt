4	Adorable location tucked away in a little cove of shops just south of 5th avenue (if you see the wine bar on the corner, you're on the right track).    Enormous selection of premium loose leaf teas available for individual pot brewed to your liking in the shop, or available by weight for home consumption.  High quality tea accoutrements are sold as well.  Service was quite good.
5	Love. This. Place.Like a mini-break when you walk inside - you could be anywhere in the world, not just Japan or China, but Morocco, the South Pacific, Madagascar....Really helpful staff, they let you smell all the many, many tins of teas.  The shop is bright and gorgeous.  You can't not buy something.  They even carry proper matcha making tools which are hard to find.  They'll make a cup or a blend for you to go too.  I could use a cup of iced Blook Orange Rooibos right now!
5	If you are a big tea drinker like myself then you must check this place out! They offer a HUGE variety of loose teas from all around the world. They have herbal, rooibos, green, black, and white teas. The selection is phenomenal and there is some loose teas here for every type of tea drinker out there. They also offer high quality tea accessories that are beautiful like the teapots and tea mugs which are very classy and not overly expensive. Great place for those looking to pick up a unique gift for a tea lover or for the tea lovers like myself it is like stepping into tea HEAVEN. The owner is also very nice and offers good advice if you are looking for a particular taste or type of tea since there are at least 50-60 loose teas to choose from. Hear my teapot whistling......gotta go!
