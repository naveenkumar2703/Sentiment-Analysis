1	In July 2012 I rode in a Yellow-Checker-Star taxi and was told by the driver that this was "the elite fleet" for locals in Las Vegas. Now that I am a local in Las Vegas, I find that this taxi company is not "elite" at all. I would honestly suggest avoiding using YCS Transportation whether you are a local in Las Vegas or a visitor. The reason: You can wait forever a never get a cab after you call. The people who take the calls sound exasperated and helpless.
1	Was told by dispatch to call another can company because we had 5 people.
5	We got JJ and he's amazing! We were really drink and he was so nice! He drove us from sapphire and to our hotel he was so nice
