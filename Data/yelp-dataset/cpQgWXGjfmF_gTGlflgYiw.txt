5	Needed a smog check on my car (which was being stubborn). When my car was rejected, they charged only $12. Technician gave me some great advise about how often the cars computer was testing itself. After tracing down the issue, and driving around an appropriate amount of time for the car to test itself, I went back, and it passed!!! :) Full smog test (passing) was only $18, which is better than other places I went to have the car tested previously.
5	The smog station is about as bare bones as you can get - its on the side of a car wash.  However, the guy running it was fast, honest, professional and friendly.  I was in and out in about 15 mins.  The price was $18.
5	Super fast and professional. With having to wait for a car in front of me it only took less than 15 minutes. I was in and out. Make sure you have cash, that is all they take. Highly recommend!!
5	Awesome. Smog test. Took all of 10 mins. $16, takes credit cards. Gentleman running this no-frills operation on the side of a car wash is very kind & gave us good tips for the DMV. We'll be back.
