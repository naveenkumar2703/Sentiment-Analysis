5	I've had several different spa services and Roenne is the best.  Whenever I travel I always treat myself to a spa day--always disappointed.  Roenne spoils her clients with the best product, service and schedule flexibility!!!  Whatever it may be a massage, colonic,  body wraps (I've had them all)  etc.... You will not be disappointed from the minute you get off the phone with Val (receptionist) to the time your session is completed with Roenne!  Everyone needs to try--definitley a hidden treasure in Vegas
5	Possibly one of the best massages I've ever had I haven't this much motion in my neck for the last 10 years.
