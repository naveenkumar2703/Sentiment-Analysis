4	I really love this shop. They have great prices, large portions and it's always made fast. What is even better is that they are open until 11pm which means yummy late purchases when you get those cravings. Their sweet and sour pork is very good. Only downside- CASH ONLY :( But an ATM is just across the street so it works out fine.
