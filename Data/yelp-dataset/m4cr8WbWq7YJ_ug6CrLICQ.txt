5	Ask any Edinburgh parent about the Sick Kids and you'll probably get a broadly similar response. It's an amazing resource for the city and a reminder that free access to healthcare professionals who really care is something for which we should be extremely grateful.I recently had to take my son in with an inexplicably (very) painful knee. The staff were unstintingly kind and turned what could have been quite a traumatic experience into something that bordered on fun ("I love having my bloods taken out"). We're not just talking toys in the waiting room - there was an 'art cart' loaded with fancy pens, stencils and bits to colour in and take home.Communication was superb, with both me and with Sam - he was never excluded or talked down to. He likes to know what's going on and I'm confident that the fact they involved him so much made the tests more bearable. Even beyond the treatment, staff members passing us in the waiting area often stopped to ask how we were doing and have a quick chat.The staff were extremely thorough, gave him loads of time and didn't diagnose him until they were confident they'd ruled out the more serious possibilities in several appointments over the course of a week.Obviously I hope we don't have too many return visits, but I'm confident that if we are ever back we'll get brilliant, personal care in a really sensitive, child-focused environment.
