5	Great urgent care.  Brought my daughter here and there was no wait at all, we were the only ones at the facility at the time.  Doctor was thorough and the offer to obtain the medication on site was offered.  I would return here and would recommend this facility to others.
5	Awesome urgent care. After leaving the urgent care on 83rd and Thunderbird for ridiculous rude treatment came here and so soso soso happy!!!! They were fast and friendly and  respectful to my son and our urgent need. Thank you thank you. So glad your close to me.
5	This is the ultimate in urgent care. It's new, clean and friendly. I was impressed with the whole staff. Had a sinus infection and was able to get the needed care in just a short time. There was an assistant who was new and doing just fine but the Dr. Followed up on what she did to make sure the results were correct.  They have a pharmacy on hand and the prices were better than what I would have paid other places. The pharmacist accompanied the asst as she went over the prescriptions with me.  I even got one prescription free by checking in on Yelp. I would recommend this place without hesitation.
5	I just went here for pain when I pee a little pricey but worth it the front desk lady was super nice the PA was really nice and I got meds to help with the pain for 15 a bottle !
5	First visit here, check in was easy & quick. Didn't wait very long at all in lobby or to be seen by the doctor. He was very friendly, and made my 6 year old feel very comfortable! Hopefully won't need anymore emergency visits, but if we do, we'll definitely be coming back here!
