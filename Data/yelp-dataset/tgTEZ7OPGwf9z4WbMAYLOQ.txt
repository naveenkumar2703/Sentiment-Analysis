5	Not many people will tell you they feel great about their post office but that's exactly how I feel about this branch. To save on money we decided to send out post cards as wedding invites instead of regular letters, in addition we decided to make our own postcards. Only after making 200 of them did we realize that the post office has SPECIFIC regulations for postcard size. They arn't trying to be mean, it's just that the computer scanner and slots are only made for that size. So we brought all of our postcards in and asked the lady what we could do. She said that she would hang on to them and HAND STAMP them and put them in the correct slots herself. She saved the wedding!
4	The folks at this location are really good. Even during the busy holiday season, they're willing to help you out with whatever you need to get done, and in the most cost-effective way.Normally going to the post office is a hassle, but I don't dread going here -- the employees are friendly and really do want to help.
4	The Post Office.  Under scrutiny by greedy people; appreciated by the locals.  Not many people know that the Post Office is non-profit and not one thin dime of your tax dollars goes to towards it.  Nope.  They make their money from STAMPS.Dig that.I went in today to mail off a package someone bought from me on eBay and my wait time was all of 10 minutes.  Whether you love it or hate it, I enjoy the convenience.  For less than half the price of the private industry delivery options, I can have my package there in 2 days; lickety-split.This afternoon, three out of the four windows were open and all was right with the world.  They're helpful, they smile (when I'm here) and they hire Veterans (a lot of them) -- so, what's not to love?
4	Made an appointment for passport renewal and arrived 10 minutes early with two young kids in tow.  Post Office employee was very personable and helpful.
