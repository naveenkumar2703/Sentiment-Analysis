4	I like this residential home- turned art gallery/event house/art school. It's a non-profit organization located in the heart of the Arts District. When it's warmer out, it tends to get a tad warmer inside too; just a warning for the hot-blooded- sometimes, there are fans running. It's several rooms of wall space as well as walkways with reasonably priced art (varying price ranges many under $100) for sale by local artists. I always see something that catches my eye. I saw a whimsical print of a woman and the same artist painted a dog; the woman print was sold BTW, so I know another person liked the piece too. Another warning, it tends to get crowded since it is a little home but if you can stand it, you might see something that you like. The collection is eclectic ranging, from landscapes to animals to the human form to thoughtful collages. Sometimes the resident artists are available. It's a must-stop for us on our First Friday trek.

I personally have been renting a spot monthly for First Friday from City Of The World and everyone that runs the Gallery is truly very friendly and wants to do what they can to help you further your opportunities.One of the things I really like about this Gallery is that when you walk around it you see many many different types of art, its not just one artist and one medium. Not that individual showings are bad but I really enjoy the mix of pieces in the gallery. I would recommend taking the time to stop by the gallery and take a look around and to top it off, take a piece of the art on the walls home to help spice up your own place a bit all while helping out a local gallery and a local artist.
