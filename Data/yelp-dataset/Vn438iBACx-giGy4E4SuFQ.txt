5	The sign doesn't just announce the business's name, it's a directive:  you must Goto Pares!  The food is great, simple, and affordable.  They've got the sweet, savory, and exotic.  No where else can you sample the type of "street" food common on the very streets and back alleys of the Philippines such as Fish Balls, Quek-Quek, Adidas, and Balut.  They even stock Milo, buko juice, and kalamansi to quench the thirst.  Worth checking out especially since they also serve full combo plates cheaper than many restaurants.  Of course, the signature goto is a must-try.
5	Inexpensive Filipino food. I tried their chicken inasal, very tender and delicious, the beef pares is a little dry but still tasty, and their goto is a little spicy but not too much which I like. We'll visit again when we go back to Las Vegas.
5	Went here for the Beef Pares and thought it was very yummy.  The aroma and flavors hmmmm.   Thats how i would describe it.. hmmmmm hahahaha. It was tender, lots of flavor and had a little fat "Sarap" and the sauce that topped the rice.  Also tried the isaw and fish ball and hmmmm.  The family that owns the place were there working and chatted with them a little bit.  Very friendly and it is good to hear how they started and where they came from.  By the way I ordered egg because I like that combination.  Tapsilog, tocilog, pares (pasilog)?  I am posting some pictures.  Have a nice day y'll?
