2	I think Kallie C. pretty much covered it.... Rude service (even when they try and act nice) and costly prices. I needed oil for my nails BAD or else I would have just went to Walgreens or Smiths or something...LOLOh and this sucks...if you have a card but don't have it on you - USELESS!
3	This store makes every other Sally Beauty Supply I have been into look like a closet. It's seriously about double the size, with tons more product on the shelves. When I stopped in recently after work, there were 3 people working. I was greeted by one employee as I came in, she didn't exactly look stoked to be there but she was polite. All I was doing was quickly picking up some nail polish (using the $5 coupon I had from joining the Sally Beauty Club!) so I didn't need any assistance. The cashier was friendly as she rang me up, and I am sure I will be back.
3	Supplies are great - wide variety and well stocked at all times. Customer service is a different story. No one ever looks particularly happy to be working there, nor are they helpful without prompting
4	I Like this because it is so close to my house. I love their nail polish selections, hair products, that a lot of other chain stores don't have.
1	Worst SBS I've ever been to! Employees are not very nice or helpful and the products are for display only so you can't see what you want to buy unless you ask aforementioned employees. Do yourself a favor and visit the one on Lake Mead, they are much nicer and have a better selection!
2	Love the selection. Been shopping here for years. The employees however are always rude and shouldn't even work in the public. Normally I grab what I need and get out of there fast as possible.
