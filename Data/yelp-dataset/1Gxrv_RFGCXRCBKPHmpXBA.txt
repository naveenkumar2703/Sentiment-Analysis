4	Regency has been in Ahwatukee for as long as I can remember, and I've been here a long time!  The staff is super friendly; they recognize me as soon as I walk in the door and even know who my parents are (who have been going there forever) and tell me that they stopped in earlier in the week.  They do alterations too!The prices are a little high, this isn't your $2/item dry cleaner.  I've used those places before and I believe you get what you pay for.  For example, they look for spots/stains before they clean my clothes, I don't have to call special attention to them.  Regency catches the stains that I miss!!  The $2 place never did that!Also, they use earth friendly cleaning products/process.  To me that makes my money worth it and it also makes me think twice before getting something dry cleaned.  "Can I get one more wear out of those dress pants?  Its not like I went hiking in them . . . yeah, I can wait."As we've all heard before, we vote with our dollars, and I vote for the local, friendly dry cleaner that cares about the planet!
5	Great service, easy and convenient location. Clothes returned just right!
2	So far I'm not happy. I dropped off a coat to be cleaned and have a button sewed on. It was supposed to be ready Friday evening. But when I came to pick it up, my coat was the only item not ready. No apologies, not even a courtesy call to let me know? Disappointing.
