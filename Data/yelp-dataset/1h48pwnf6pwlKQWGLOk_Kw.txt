5	I love Menchies. Best Fro-yo I've ever had, and it definitely beats out ice cream places too!Amazing flavours-- red velvet, cake batter, peanut butter, watermelon tart!Awesome atmosphereand fun loyalty cards. You collect enough 'smiles' and you get free fro-yo! LOVE.
2	I do enjoy frozen yogurt when it's creamy and tart but you will not find that at menchie's. this place is the definition of overpriced cheesy place aimed at trendy university students who don't know any better. The frozen yoghurt had the consistency of slushies from 7-11 and the flavours were pretty limited. I would say do yourself a favour and spend the $5 at frat burgers or mozy's.
4	All the yogurt and toppings here are great! The only thing they can work on is being a bit more clean. Other then that great customer service and good quality yogurt.
2	Expensive and crowdedI'd rather much go to the supermarket and buy frozen yoghurt than go to menchies.
