5	A wonderful place to learn to dance. The weekly group classes are a good place to start. The size of the group classes are small enough to ensure u have the personal attention of the instructor. I have attended group classes at other places, and this place is heads and shoulder above it. At those places, u are in a room full of like 30-40 people and U always end up having an unbalanced class ratio of guys to gals, so u might end up dancing the wrong steps many times, or end up standing around more than dancing. The instuctors here, Maryanna and Carlos would dance with each student and also observe each of U when you dance, allowing for immediate corrections and guidance on making you a better dancer. At those other community classes, U'll be lucky if the instructor knows your name at the end of 6 weeks.Definitely worth a visit and stopping by, you will not be disappointed.
5	My fiance and I came here to take our 'wedding first dance' lessons. We only had time to do 2 sessions (due to our long distance relationship), and our instructor (Mariana?) made sure we finished! She had a great sense of humor, professional, fun... the list could go on. We really enjoyed our time here & we plan on coming here for group lessons!
5	Went for the first time last night with my girlfriend to try something new. This was a BLAST! I've been thinking about the class and dancing all day.  We'll be back next week for sure.  I love the drop-in classes for $6 and the instructors were Great!!
