3	I got my oil changed in 30 minutes.  It was quick, painless, and I wasn't "hussled".  They mentioned I would want to replace something but they didn't try and force me to do it then and there.  I also got my oil change through groupon so it was nice to see a big company like Midas giving out discounts!
4	I got my oil changed here.  Found a coupon on the midas website and figured I would give them a try.  My car has always gone to the dealer for service but lately they are going downhill.  I was pleasantly surprised by this location.  They are very courteous and checked a few things on my car.  Didnt try to upsell me, just stated the facts.  It did take a while for my oil change to be done thats the reason for four and not five stars but overall a good experience.  I will be visiting them again.
5	came into town with an unidentified problem.  we use midas in California all the time, so hoped this would be a good fit.  we gave the manager our latest paperwork, she spoke with the ca. manager, had the mechanics take a look, and in half an hour we were on our way.  thanks for taking care of a couple of out-of-towners!
5	Mike and his team here are just superb! There was a noise with my suburban. They checked, add oil to the 4wd. Told us to make sure and let the people that change oil top the all the fluids next time. That's it! It was free, no hidden fees! Service with a smile!! Love it!!
