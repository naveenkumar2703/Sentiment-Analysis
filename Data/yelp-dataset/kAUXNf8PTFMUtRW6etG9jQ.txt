4	Anthem Country Club is a very nice place to play at.  The course isn't extremely hard, the greens are nice, and the field is nice to play on.  I love the driving range service.  I feel sorry for the poor houses whenever I play here.  I need to fix that darn slice.  Well I love playing here.
4	They do a good job , but it is just a guard gate . you can not buy anything here . you can not play anything here . Hell all you do is talk to the guard so you can go inside .oh and it is kid friendly !! they can listen to the radio while you check in . LONG LIVE THE DUKE OF THE GUARD GATE !!
1	This is nothing against the guards themselves. Never mind that my friend, who lives in Anthem and shall remain unnamed, calls them toy cops. Actually, I think that's my term.Anyway, going through this guard gate is always a pain. I never want to live in a gated community, let alone a community with a staffed gate. Luckily, I showed up early on Superbowl Sunday and avoided the half hour plus waits the other guests endured.On a positive note, it's nice that you can get alerts on your phone whenever your guests go through.
2	It just seems to be an experienced based on who is working. The want to be military general, or the guy that realizes he is just a poorly paid security gate guard.
