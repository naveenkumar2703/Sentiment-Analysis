5	Everybody needs a local watering hole and the Famous Wing provides the perfect- no fuss environment. It's under new ownership as of April 2007, so some of the greasy spoon legacy should be working itself out. But if you want a nice cold beer, good friendly conversation and WIRELESS INTERNET ACCESS AT A BAR- then you should go.
2	Nothing much to impress me here.Stopped by here on Saturday night. There was a decent crowd and a Karaoke DJ (worst karaoke I have experienced). The place just seemed plain dirty overall - we lasted about 10-min. Didn't bother to try the food - maybe their Wings are famous, but the location just plain stinks.
4	triple decker toasted cheese sandwiches are on the menu.  that should be enough to get you in there.  also, they make tater tots crispier than breaded-deep-fried bacon served on a bed of captain crunch.  on tuesday nights they have acoustic live music which is always good.  see you there.
1	Stopped in for a Bloody Mary on Sunday because Hazelwood's and Zipps were jam-packed. The neon sign on the place says "Darwin's" but apparently is known as "Famous Wings."Here's a "joke" from the bartender:"What's the worse thing about being a Packers fan?Telling your dad you're gay."Bash Packers' fans all you want, but "gay" is not a synonym for "stupid."Food was sampled and left mostly uneaten. Skip it!
1	OMG!!  So this place is under new owners and this place SUCKS now!!  Ever since the new owners bought it this place has gone to HELL!  The food is frozen and not freshly cooked like it used to be.We used to go here for $2 breakfast every Sat and Sun morning.  Our favorite bartender Tim is gone and our favorite cook is gone and our favorite waitress is gone and this place just sucks egg shells now!!The owner thinks he can cook, so what does he do??? He puts the cook out on the floor to be a server!! WTH?!?  So bad for business.Truly wish the previous owners would come back.
