4	This is a sweet little spot in a strip mall. They have decent beds, a standup sans acrylics, a leg tanner, and a Mystic system. I've gone at odd times and they have always given me unlimited time to get ready, so you don't have to rush through sliming on your lotion and missing half of yourself. Full-length mirrors in all the rooms.  The girl at the counter has always been so sweet and helpful, never bitchy or snooty, and the prices are great esp. if you're maintaining. They carry many brands of lotions and have tons of affordable samples and also aromatherapy candles! Give them a try if you are looking for a new salon.
4	Staff is awesome, stephanie is the sweetest!  they are all knowledgeable and professional
5	What a fabulous staff! Everyone is so great and and wonderful customer service. The beds are awesome and they even offer cool towels to refresh yourself with after you tan. Decent pricing on lotions and good priced packages. I've never had to wait....plus they have some fun clothes and accessories.
5	I am beyond excited about this place. The fact that its just around the corner from where I live is awesome enough. But I was hooked as soon as I walked in. They have a nice little sitting area with a Keurig and a mini fridge. They keep it stocked with free bottles of water and chilled washcloths soaked in minty water. The staff was very friendly and the prices weren't bad at all. The beds were clean and they provided stickers, body sprays, baby wipes, and a radio in the room. I will definitely continue to tan here.
