1	If I could give this college no stars that would be my rating. I don't know about the undergraduate school, but my one semester of graduate school there was a disaster and a huge waste of money. Basically, they over-admit students to their Masters program in Education. I could only register for two classes per semester. When I interviewed this school for their grad program, they assured me that I could complete my MA in two semesters. Totally false! After my first semester was completed, my professor emailed me during Winter break to inform me that my last project was unacceptable. This woman was totally disorganized and a liar. It shocked me that a college professor would resort to lying.  I even have her emails to prove it! Why in the world would a professor wait until the semester was over to tell me that she found my final project unacceptable! Furthermore, communication with anyone from the College of Education is a joke. You can wait weeks until you get a response to your  emails. I would not recommend this graduate program to anyone. It's a total ripoff. All they want is their tuition money. I feel that I was "oversold" their graduate program. Also, I found almost the entire staff to be deceitful in the college of education. In fact I am filing formal complaints to all the government agencies that oversee colleges and universities. I don't want any other grad student  to be ripped off and lied to at this college.
