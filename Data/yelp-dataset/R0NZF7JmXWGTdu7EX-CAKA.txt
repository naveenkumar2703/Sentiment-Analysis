3	Pies. I like pies.However, the pies are very expensive if you purchase one when they do not have their sales.We purchased a pecan pie the week before thanksgiving and paid almost $18.00However, the pie was fresh and decadent. The service was good, fast and speedy. I do love their pies, however I will have to wait till the next time they are $7.99
4	Blueberry banana bread!!! It was so Yummy. Everything that we have gotten for breakfast has been wonderful. At the time we go in 7am they just have opened so its quite. But the staff is always nice and on there toes. Even though it is morning you can always have a slice of famous pie or one to go!!
4	This place is consistently good and at such a low price. It is like home made. The staff never wants you to miss a deal, if you buy a drink you get the salad bar cheaper etc. The pies are amazing. Just good food. The world needs a good, affordable place to eat when you work all the time!!
3	I'd always wanted to eat at one of these! I'm from the South and had always heard that it was the only place to get southern-style food out west. Not exactly true, but it IS hard to find! I've been here twice and both times the food was very tasty. I think the prices are too high for this type of food or I would have given it a better rating. I almost always try to get some pie; the French apple is the best! Oh my god - so good! They also have sweet tea, so yes. Customer service is usually a nice elderly lady. In fact, most of the clientele are elderly people or families. You won't find the glitz and glamour of Vegas here; just regular salt of the earth folks. :p
