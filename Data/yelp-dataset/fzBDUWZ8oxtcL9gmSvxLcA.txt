5	I love Watson's flowers.  I received a dozen roses from my sweetheart on Valentine's day and they lasted over 2 1/2 weeks.   It's so awesome.  The arrangements are nice looking and last a LOT longer than grocery store flowers.
5	My husband always chooses Watson's when he orders me flowers and they never disappoint.  I received an arrangement of white lilies with white babies breath on September 13th for our 35th wedding anniversary.  My husband didn't know the address of my office, but told them the name of the company and they took care of the rest.  My flowers arrived at the correct location, no problem.The arrangement came with quite a few buds and one by one they all opened.  It is now September 21st and I still have one lily left.  I know I'll have to probably throw it out tomorrow, but the babies breath still look as good as they day they arrived.Watson's always uses the freshest flowers that last days longer then any other florist's I've experienced.
5	This place has been great to pick up flowers for my wife on the weekends. I normally call about an hour before I plan to pick up and they do an awesome job. I ask for them to make up a hand-wrapped bouquet (sometimes with specific requests) within a certain price point, and they never disappoint me.
5	Stopped by for the first time to get flowers for the lady.  I requested something with sunflowers in a short square vase. They were very helpful, but something together and showed great creativity.  Those flowers have been on display in her home for over a week and they're still going strong. I'll be back for more in the near future!
