3	carts arealways a mess, store employees are rude or complaining all the time. i live very close and am very dissappointed in my neighborhood market:(:(
1	ghetto walmart from hellstore is actually pretty nice insidestaff is friendlybut....... the creepy people that approach you in the parking lot are enough to keep me from ever coming here againseriously a minimum of two people are lurking next to your car when you come out, and they are quick to get nasty with you if you don't have any change to give them
4	I had never been to one of these locations and was pleasantly surprised. It's all the good things about Walmart's grocery section without the hassle of EVERYTHING ELSE in the way. You can get in, pick up your produce and other food needs, and then get to a register. The register never has a line. BEAUTIFUL! This has simplified the grocery experience. Walmart prices and quality without having to wait for someone in front of you to check out with 5 items from every section in the entire store.
2	I was checking out of this store and a cashier was eating fried chicken while handling my items. Gross!
1	I don't like this Walmart food store at all. Its not safe to come here. Plus The staff is not customer friendly. There's never more than one or two cashiers open. It's not worth coming here and dealing with the bad staff and creepy/crazy people who hang out here. It is not a safe place!!
4	I went to this store the other day and the people here were so friendly.  They took the time to look in the back when I was looking for a giant Hello Kitty plushy for my friend's last birthday.  Several of the graveyard staff have been easy to talk to when I went during my late night trips as well.  This is on top of the convenience and low prices this place already offers.
