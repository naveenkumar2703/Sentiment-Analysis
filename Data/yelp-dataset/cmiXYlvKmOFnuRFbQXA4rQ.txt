4	It was SO cold today!  So here I was, chillin' like ice in my cube pretending to be hard at work when it struck me.  While my salad in the fridge might be the healthy choice, I was freaking COLD and there was no way I was eating more coldness.  I wanted warm comfort food.  But without the sit down comfort food prices.  Chili.  Wendy's has Chili.For less than $3 and in less than 10 minutes round trip, I had a big thing of chili, an order of chicken nuggets and I was headed back to the office.  Broke up the crackers, stirred into the chili.  Mmmmm... heaven.  You can get it with extra onions and/or w/ cheese on top.  Small 99cents, large is like $1.75.  Yea, Wendy's is good for your standard drive through burger stuff too, and I happen to love the heck out of their dollar menu, but nothing beats Chili in the drive through on a cold day!
4	Wendy's gets knocked from time to time for rocking square beef patties and flaunting their salads and soups as "healthy." Though I can't really speak to the soups or salads, I'll tell you what I can speak to: frosties. Eat a burger, fries and a frosty and tell me you're not satisfied afterwards. Because you'll be lying through your teeth. Wendy's is cheap, fast, and if you don't like it, well I guess I just don't believe you.
3	This Wendy's drive through is open late. Like most Wendy's the food is tasty, cheap, and comes out quick. Not much else to say, it is a Wendy's...
4	Love Wendy's new salads and burgers. This was my first visit to this particular location and I found it to be very clean. I felt bad for the guy running the cash register because no one was helping him but he was very polite.
