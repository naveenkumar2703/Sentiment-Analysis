5	Randy and Irma have professional crews that come in and do a fantastic job painting. They will come in and help you determine colors and finishes - They prep and cleanup and will even move furniture if needed. They have done painting jobs at both my home and at my business - Keep up the great work Randy!!!
5	One year ago we had indoor painting done before we moved to sell our house. I am writing the review now because we are having painting done in our new house, and I wish I was still in Gilbert so I could just call Certa Pro. Made me realize I should've written a review about them.  I use reviews all the time myself. Anyways,  Randy, who did the estimate  for the painting was very professional, straightforward and friendly. He went out of his way to make sure to find  a time that would work for us.  The person who painted (don't remember his name) was also professional. He was timely, skilled, and a neat worker. We were very happy with the work done overall. We sold our house in one day.
5	In June 2013 we had Randy come give us a quote to paint the interior of our entire home.  Randy was easy to talk to, straight forward, and took the time to answer all of my questions thoroughly.  The actual painting process was top notch.  The painters were friendly and they worked hard.  While doing the work they also made sure to keep everything clean, making sure there were no spills or leftover pieces of paper or other debris throughout the house.
