1	On 12/29/09 I sent a parcel with T-Shirts and Candy to my brother overseas. The postal worker at the post office said that he "may open the parcel to CHECK" what is inside.Sure enough he did "CHECK" the contents of the parcel after I left the P.O.The result - I wasted $28 on postage, my brother never received the parcel, the P.O worker was rude and spiteful, my parcel's contents was stolen.
3	Pros: the were well-stocked with US priority mail boxes and they even had tape available for customers, which is a rarity in most USPS locations nowadays. Counter worker Craig was really helpful to a couple of customers while I was in line. Seemed like they were all nice folks working here. Cons: multiple reviewers on other sites have indicated they have seen evidence of mail handlers loosing packages and opening packages for no apparent reasons. Hopefully they've got that sorted out now! I was a bit wary but I wasn't sending or receiving anything critical. Still, you have to be a bit worried when you see people mention stuff like that....
4	I think one's experience with any post office depends on the time of day you go. Having it be crowded during the Christmas season compared to 1:40p in the afternoon in mid January will be two different experiences. I must say I have been pleased with my visits thus far. Staff at the counter have been helpful and try not to rush you. That is great, except when there is a longer line. Great service can slow down the waiting time. Nice clean facility, stocked up nicely with shopping supplies. All in all, 4 stars.
