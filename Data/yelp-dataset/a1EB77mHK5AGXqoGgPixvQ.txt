5	This is a great boutique in N. E. Mesa, full of funky and eclectic gifts and wares.  The shop might be small, but it boasts personality!
5	The East Valley gets a bad rap sometimes, but tucked away in a quiet little strip mall is one of my favorite gift spots in the Valley. Mesa's Elaine Todd is a boutique made for gifters! Nothing they sell is ordinary, so you're bound to get something unique and fun. From books and decorations to little trinkets, Elaine Todd is the best place in Mesa for escaping the everyday with a little creativity and whimsy in each item!
1	I was a consigned artist in this store, after only being paid 2 times in a year I wanted to go pick up my items. I get there and realize the owner has either copied my art herself or had someone do it. I was also picking up artwork for 6 other artist that were not paid either. As I was collecting our goods I noticed that other items had been duplicated as well. The store owner once again either reproduced other hand made items, that we trusted her with, or had someone steal the idea. Her recreation of many of the items is at best a hack job, one being she bought one of my sisters magnets and glued it to a box similar to other items my sister makes. Pretty pathetic! I put her on blast on facebook and she flagged the post because it was exposing her as a thief. Her coasters were copper wrapped with cardboard backings just like my sister's, hair clip and rings just like chuladas, license plate key rings and necklaces like mine and many other items. So if you are in the store beware she may try to steal your style, your watch, your soul with her lack of integrity!
1	Yikes, sure doesn't sound like a place I would go to. Integrity is everything.
