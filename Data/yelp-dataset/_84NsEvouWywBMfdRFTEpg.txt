5	I had a great experience at this TSA check point. There were plenty of metal detectors and agents on staff to make the screenings move quickly. The agents were relaxed, personable, and speedy. In fact, my screener told my to keep my shoes on. I was in and out in a split second. This was the greatest security screening I've ever been through; invasive body and luggage scans have never been so easy.
1	So, last two weeks for some reason the TSA Pre is closed early. Upon inquiring, they are now closing TSA Pre at the T1 D-Gates at 8:00pm on Sunday evenings. So much for those of us taking the red eye!!! Staff is very professional and trying hard but there are not enough of them. What are they thinking!!!!
1	Sorry tsa fat boy but you did this just have to say that your customer service skills need work.   Thank you for checking my id, boarding pass and pausing dramatically when talking to me just so you can tell me to go around you are just the unproductive employee that everyone is itching to rant about because you suck at your job.
