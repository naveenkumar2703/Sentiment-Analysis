4	Ann Taylor loft clothing beats Ann Taylor any day.  It is more stylish and less expensive.  They often have great sales going on and if you are a young professional woman, this place is up there with Banana Republic for chic blazers and skirts.  Also cute shoes and accessories. 4 stars.
1	Crappy customer service.  I was the only minority in the store the whole time (wearing Ann Taylor clothes I had previously purchased at other stores) and these biotches followed me around like I was going to steal something.
1	Worst service ever.
1	Terrible customer service. Was denied the option to return items out of return window that was easily taken back and reimbursed at an alternate location. Was not allowed to talk to a manager when requested.  Disappointed this represents the LOFTs brand.
