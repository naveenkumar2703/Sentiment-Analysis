5	I absolutely adore Misty! Only stylist I know I can trust to make decisions about how to change my hair, and simply leave it to her. I know it will look good.
5	Misty is the best! I usually just let her decide what to do with my hair, and it always looks great. With other stylists, I always find that I need to go home and redo my hair. But with Misty it's always soft and shiny and perfect. She is a great conversationalist too, which is super important to me. I don't even live in Las Vegas anymore, but when I come to town twice a year, seeing Misty for a new do is always on the top of my to/do list.
5	Misty is a great stylist!  She makes you feel welcome and comfortable as soon as you walk through the door of her super cute and private work area in Sola Salons.  I decided to cut off ten inches of hair to donate.  Misty new exactly what needed to be done and made the process super easy!  I am very low maintenance when it comes to my hair (wash and let air dry) but I wanted a cut that looked stylish and had some body.  Misty gave me exactly what I was looking for and I could not be happier.  I have been getting compliments left and right about the new haircut.
5	Misty has been my hairstylist for 2 years. She is wonderful and very talented. Recently I got a Enjoy Keratin smoothing treatment from her. It ways everything my frizzy hair needed. If you need one, I highly recommend her. Thanks Misty!
