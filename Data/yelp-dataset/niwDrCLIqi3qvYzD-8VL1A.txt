1	This place was terrible!Terrible service, old equipment, dirty uniforms and slow, slow service!!We order a basic cheese hotdog, and they just reheat something that was already sitting on the grill, which makes me wonder if they're even following health regulations on temperatures and food handling.Will never go back. Was just too gross.
1	wish I had read the other review. lady took 8 orders prossesed cash and cards, then without washing her hands made everyone's food one order at a time. waited 15 mins for old fries, a hot dog that was already on the grill when I ordered and paid $9. fuck you Nathan's, and fuck you aramark.
4	I am giving this Nathan's the four stars that I believe it is worthy of. Born and raised in New York, I am a fan of Nathan's food. And it isn't their hot dogs. In my opinion Nathan's crinkly fries are at the top of the totem pole of delicious fries. And their super cheeseburger is greatly underrated. In my opinion, Nathan's super cheeseburger is better than In N Out Burger.  Service has never been Nathan's strong point. Service at the Arizona Mills Nathan's was slow. I was not in a rush, and waiting 5 minutes did not kill me. The fact that they cooked the super cheeseburger and crinkly fries fresh and they were delicious justified the 5 minute wait.   The prices here are reasonable. In my adopted city of Las Vegas, I have been paying double the price of what a super cheeseburger meal costs here.  Nathan's food is greatly underrated. I am giving Nathan's the respect it deserves by my 4 star rating.
