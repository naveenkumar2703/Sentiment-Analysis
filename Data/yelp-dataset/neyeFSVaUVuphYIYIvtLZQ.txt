5	A great cut at a great price! I am always a little leary of trying out a new barber (I am fairly new to the razor cut), but rest assured this place is professional and it's one of the best cuts I've had.
5	I came here with the kiddos like 4 weeks ago and I really liked how they cut their hair.nice little place in the corner of val vista and southern.
1	Worst barber shop EVER!  Save yourself the money and hassle of having to get your hair re-cut somewhere else after visiting here.  Rude!  Untalented!  There really is nothing good to say about this place.  Terrible.  Stat away.
3	I been coming here for about 3 years and they been great for most part, mainly because of Marcella ( I think that was her name). Always was a great cut and gave like 20 /30 min awesome massages. She left in December 13 and it has gone down hill ever since. I got my haircut about every 3 weeks .
