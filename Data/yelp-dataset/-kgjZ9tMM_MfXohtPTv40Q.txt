4	This is a proper pub that well stocked abd well run by Davy. the have over 60 malts to choose from and plenty real ale. Its not noisy and more like the kind of pub people's dads would like. But I'm getting old, and this is now my thing too.
3	Your quintessential old mans pub. Last time I was here, smoking was still acceptable inside the inner sanctum. Dark, with rank smoke saturated throughout the walls, this was everything a local pub should be, complete with some well-into-their years regulars. I do have to say it - and I have to go back as heaven forbid there was a redecoration effort here, as that would break my ice-cold heart - the thing I loved about the Ormelie, and has resulted in the treasured place it holds for me, is the wallpaper in the womens' bathroom. I kid you not, it was women farting fire. I hope to god it is still there - update will follow shortly to confirm.
4	Real ales, a chatty & convivial atmosphere and ample TVs for watching sport make this an appealing bolt-hole at the easten edge of Portobello.
