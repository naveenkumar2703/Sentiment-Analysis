5	went with my roommate and boyfriend at Atomic Liquors on Friday night to have a couple of cocktails.. all of a sudden a tray of large sized samples toted by a sweet blonde girl caught the eye of the boys. she let us know that its was from the food truck " Truck-N-Yaki", parked right outside.  the samples werent super hot, obviously, but even so, they were so good and after one more cocktail, we all found ourselves hungry and wanting more. I headed out to the truck and ordered two chicken and fried rice bowls since they were only $4 a piece. the portions are huge for what you are paying too. service was very fast , as i only waited about 2 minutes. Seriously, SOOOO freakin good and such sweet people operating. I found myself daydreaming about it at work today.  long story short, we had two orders, then ordered two more on our way to the car!!! better than a lot of restaurants Ive tried since moving to Vegas. if you are passing by and see the truck, STOP!
5	I have to admit - I was a little bit nervous about shrimp from a food truck. Boy oh boy was I wrong! Yesterday I got the shrimp teriyaki plate (served with veggies and fried rice). The shrimp was nothing less than delectable - perfectly cooked, plump and delicious. The fried rice and veggies likewise had amazing flavor. I will definitely order from this truck again.Also, they have a really interesting sounding Asian burrito with similar ingredients that i really want to try...
5	I got to try this food truck out at First Friday last night.  It was oh so delicious!  I got a chicken japanese burrito and it was really tasty!  And the price was really reasonable.  I'm a big fan and hope to see them next First Friday!
5	Wow! Absolutely amazing food for a reasonable price! Thank you for coming to punk rock bowling, you guys are amazing! The Japanese Burrito and the Chicken Plate were both perfectly done! Great job guys!
