5	Best Old School place on the west coast! The dj's keep the jams coming! They throw in some new school r and b and hip hop. Great crowd, all ages (21 and up). Great security, great drinks and prices! You won't be disappointed unless you forget your Dancing shoes!!Dress to impress fellas and of course the ladies must look fly :) dress code in effect!
4	Had a great time!! Music was pumping and the crowd came to party. Will be definitely coming back
3	Pretty ghetto and the music is old. But we had a good time because the drinks were cheap, had a private space and were partying with good company.
2	Music is old school R&B and hip hop...very diverse group! I thought old school also meant disco and freestyle but none whatsoever!!! Drinks were regular club amount $$! No cover charge so you get what you pay for...all so cal people that know the Lakewood Hop...this is the same thing...2 stars because everyone else seemed to enjoy themselves but it is just not my crowd but I went off Yelp reviews so lesson learned.
