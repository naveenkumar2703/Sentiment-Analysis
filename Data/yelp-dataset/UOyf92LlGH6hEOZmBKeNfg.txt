3	I drive by here all the time, but never really paid attention.  Now I know what this is.  It's a scrap yard.  They pay for scrap (mostly metal).  In my case I had a dead water heater to get rid of.  It doesn't pay a lot, but it's still about $8 for something I would otherwise probably have to pay to have hauled away.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I will definitely come here again if I have scrap to dispose of.And they're open Saturday till 1pm
5	Excellent experience. I rarely go to any place especially a metal recycler that impresses me. So kind and curious.
4	Awesome place. They take all kinds of metals. Aluminum, steel, microwave ovens, water heaters, etc. just makes you think twice before throwing something away. Just wish they had more amicable hours.
1	Whoa, screwed up coming here on a Saturday.  I have been in a line for 45 minutes waiting and no one is moving.  The staff must be on strike.
5	We just took in some assorted cables and car batteries and I was surprised on just how well this business is ran!  Nick here and his help were VERY informative on how all the scrap buisness should be done HONESTLY!  Everything was shown on the scale and the prices fair! I made the mistake taking a few times elsewhere and no doubt got ripped off since that busiess never asked for ID or showed me the scale etc.  I highly recommend this company for a honest price and friendly service!  Thanks Nick!
