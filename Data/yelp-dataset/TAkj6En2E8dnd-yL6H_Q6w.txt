5	Its the best pho in k.w,and most places I have been to in t.dot
3	Good food but could be spicier. Just dumping on the sriracha and sambar Orleans isn't what I was looking for. It's good and not expensive, so go for it.
1	Of the three Pho Dau Bo's, this is the worst.   Incredibly inconsistent from visit to visit.1/2 the time food is not very hot, meat is either overcooked or reheated and tough.The other two are by far better.Really enjoy Pho Dau Bo
