5	At first I was reluctant to try since it was at a gas station but went for it. For $4 I was very full and very happy with my meal. Ordered the Machaca Torta.... pork with fried egg, guacamole, on the best torta bread. Soo DELICIOUS! Open 24/7
5	great Mexican food spot! we order lunch from here all the time we just call in our order n it's ready for us in 15 min.
3	I was on a road trip and they delayed me because of bad cow disease.....The food was ok flavor wise, so I won't rate them as low as I Should, but I got a bad burrito and " MONTEZUMA'S  REVENGE " to put it nicely.   I'm not sure if their normal kitchen practice is not checking their meat, but it delayed my trip and I wouldn't recommend them.  It may be ok ???,but just seems like a quick stop, take your chances kind of place to me. I think you have to eat at palace more than once to really tell how good or safe they are. I definitely wouldn't eat there again, unless there is a zombie apocalypse and no where else has power.
4	The food is delicious and the staff is friendly. I've eaten here before and wouldn't hesitate to eat here again.It was good going in, let's just hope on it's way out I don't experience, as another Yelper phrased it "Montezuma's Revenge". Lol :-D
