5	My mom and I both have used Frank for multiple plumbing needs.  Replaced toilets, water filters, sink faucets, garbage disposals, you name it.  Frank is ALWAYS on time, completely honest, very clean and neat, and friendly.  His pricing is reasonable, not the cheapest, but not over-inflated.  He is up-front about the cost for any parts he purchases. I feel safe having Frank in our home and know that he will get the job done.
5	I have used Frank's services and recommended him many times since 2006.  He is always honest and reliable.  Not only is he punctual, but often early!  He has plumbed a gas line, changed out plumbing fixtures and resolved a stubborn clog.  He has pride in his work and it shows!
