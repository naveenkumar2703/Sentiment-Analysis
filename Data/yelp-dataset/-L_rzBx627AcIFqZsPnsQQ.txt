5	There are three people that regularly work here. Pretty normal. The 40 year old lady with the glasses is pretty cool. She seems like the bosslady. Like most Circle K's this one is clean.No jalepenos in the hot dog area. Apparently, "they spoil too quickly" Oh yeah, this place has a different type of 44oz fountain cup every other day.
4	Nice store. Clean and well stocked. Staff very nice. Area a little rough but well lit and on the corner. Great selection of drinks, alcohol, ice creams, pastries, snacks and fresh fruits at good prices.They are also a lotto store.Good store and worthy of your business.
3	This place is in a bit of a rough part of town (I live out of state and I've been here when people have run off without paying for gas THREE different times) but I always come back because dang it, they have giant fountain drinks for cheap! I'm talking 59 cents for a 100 ounce bladder buster Diet Pepsi. Circle K usually has great deals on bottled water too. Guess I get thirsty in the desert. As a female, I probably wouldn't stop here alone at night.
