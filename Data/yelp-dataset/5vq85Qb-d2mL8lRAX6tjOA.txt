5	On September 7th, I had the pleasure of attending a grand opening event for the Verde Dining Pavilion at the Arizona State University West Campus.  Little did I know that several months later, I would be working at the ASU West Campus enjoying delicious cafeteria style dining at the Verde Dining Pavilion.  The staff are very friendly, the food varies day by day and has a little of everything, and the atmosphere is just right whether you're enjoying a meal with other students or staff, need to study or read a book, or randomly make some new friends.  The Verde Dining Pavilion is operated by a company called Aramark, which does a wonderful job taking in feedback from students, staff, and faculty.  They have done a wonderful job building the 37,000 square-foot dining hall, which has reservable spaces attached and is an easy walk to anywhere on the ASU West Campus.  The restaurant is an all-you-care-to-eat restaurant, meaning it is a buffet.  You can use cash, credit card, or maroon & gold dollars (M&G).  As the ASU website suggestions, you can "enjoy a deli, full salad bar, grill, home zone, action station" or more!  If you are near the ASU campus, check it out some time, especially if you are a student, staff, or faculty member.

So I stopped in here today & was greeted by 95+ food treats, plus sauces, dressings & LOTS of included beverage choices, all served up in a comfortable, modern style dining room.For soup to start, I chose a bowl of Cheddar Broccoli.  Then it was onto a salad with many tasty goodies to put on it, plus sides such as delicious hummus!Over at the hot food area there were cold sandwiches prepared, plus hot sandwiches being made to order, including burgers & hotdogs but I passed up on those in favor of slices of tasty Roast Pork, Potatoes Au Gratin & steamed broccoli for my main meal.  Then it was back for seconds of Lasagne & a big slice of excellent, thin crust Pepperoni Pizza, & finally just some vanilla ice cream from the many dessert choices.An excellent Buffet here, for an inexpensive $8.35.LUNCH HOURS:Mon - Fri:  11 AM - 2:30 PMSat & Sun:  10 AM - 1:30 PM
