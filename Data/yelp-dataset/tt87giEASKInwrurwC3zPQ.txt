5	Love this boutique! I bought a pair of jeans here a while back, and was feeling guilty about the price, however I wear them sooooo much, so I know I got my money's worth! I wore them all through my pregnancy even! I also got some cute wedge flip flops that I love so much! If you like cute, blingy stuff, then this is your store! And the owners are so nice!
1	I've been to this store twice.  First time, I spent about 2 hours and a lot of money.  The second time I went in, I attempted to introduce myself to the store owner, as I (again) intended to buy a lot of merchandise, and all my friends told me how nice the owner was.  She didn't even look up when I extended my hand.  She was COMPLETELY RUDE to me.  As a result of her behavior, I put several items back on the shelf, and only left with what I felt I absolutely HAD to have (a pair of Corky's sparkly sandals).  Immediately went home to see if I could find the shoes on-line so I wouldn't have to get my stash from someone who was so mean.  She actually did me a favor - as my credit card digits won't be getting worn off at HER store.  I plan to tell all my friends in Province (several ladies from there shop at Poco Loco) not to shop there as well.  Her stuff is VERY EXPENSIVE, and after being treated so badly, I won't ever be going back.
3	Like their clothes, but not enough variety of sizes. I didn't think their prices were to bad. I've spent more and got less at other places. If you want some bling then that is the place to go. I bought a pair of jeans and got one free. I paid $64.00 total. If you go to buckle you would have paid about $198.00 for one pair. These are similar to buckles design in jeans. Hurry they are clearing inventory.
