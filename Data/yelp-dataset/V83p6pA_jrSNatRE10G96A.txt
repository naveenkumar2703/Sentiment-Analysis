3	Well, if you really love Scotland and feel the need to declare your love in the form of a t-shirt then Fantastic Scotland is the place for you.They stock a whole range of t-shirts all stating their love for Scotland and in all different colours too. Hoodies, tees, polos, baggy shirts, you name it, it's there. As Lynsey has mentioned, the prices here are reasonable and if you want a silly reminder of your trip to Scotland then you have to come here, even if it's just to say, "Yeah, whatever, I've been there, done that, got the t-shirt. Next!"
3	Definitely one for the tourists, Fantastic Scotland is geared towards visitors who happen to think Scotland is fantastic!Steering away from the traditional tat, Fantastic Scotland is largely a t shirt stockist. Selling t shirts with saltires and slogans on them, it's pretty cheesy but all in good spirits. As Gavin said it is corny but it's fun for the tourists.I heart Scotland, but I wouldn't wear the t shirt. Some tourists would love to, however, and for those guys this place is just the ticket.
5	The t-shirts they provide are beautiful! They also use Gildan, so you'd know that the fabric is good.Their t-shirts may seem pricey, but when you look at other souvenir stores, you realize the quality from those stores aren't as good and they're also slightly pricier, so buy your shirts from here. You won't find the prints in any other store... I tried when they were closed.
