4	This place is pretty good if you like cheap, quick chinese food.  I love the General Chicken.  You have to watch out because they tend to make it all pretty spicy.  The price is very cheap and they give quick service.  I would recommend it for take out not eat at the place.
3	I give them a solid 3 star review.All in all it was pretty decent and economical chinese delivery for the entire family. Everyone I had contact with was friendly. This meal fed us all for supper and we all have leftover for lunch the next day for $45. I've had better chinese food, but this is the best (thus far) of what I have at hand within MY local delivery area........and that was the whole point. I didn't want to cook, I didn't want to drive anywhere, and I wanted chinese food. Score!So of of the 6 locations this got the middle of the road average at 2.5 stars. I ordered not knowing this so I'll share my experience of how it was from start to finish.They actually have a much higher rating on Urbanspoon(US) of 81% which has 4 reviews, 3 of them were recent from 2011. I found them on google maps looking for "chinese". I was able to see the menu clearly and decided to give them a try.For a total of $40.55 I got:1 large order of orange chicken($7.45)1 large order of beef pepper steak($7.95)1 large order of chicken egg foo young($6.95)1 wor wonton soup($5.95)1 small order of veggie egg rolls($1.75)1 chicken fried rice($4.95)1 order cream cheese wontons (free with order, but would have cost $3.95)The woman on the phone had a strong accent but I managed to get my order through. I asked if there were any deals and because my order was above a certain amount she threw in a free order of cream cheese wontons, which my son will love. She was very friendly.I was quoted at 1 hr on the delivery. It arrived right on time. There was nothing missing from the order and it arrived hot without anything leaking.I paid $45 total, including the tip to the driver.Large chicken entrees run around $7.45, Sm $4.75Large Beef entrees run around $7.95, Sm $4.95Large Seafood varies from $8.45-$10.25, Sm $5.25 Egg Foo Young from $5.95-$7.95, Sm $3.95-$4.25They also do Lo Mein, Chow Mein, Curry, Teriyaki, Pad Thai, Chow Fun(noodles), Hong Kong style pan fried crispy noodles, rice noodles, and 6 vegetarian entrees.======================================First, the bad:I found the war wonton soup to be very bland. I added a lot of soy sauce because it tasted like watery broth. I would not buy the soup again. On a good note, it tasted better with the soy sauce. There were also chunks of bbq pork and whole shrimp. Lots of goodies in their soup.I didn't think the cream cheese wontons to be worth the money if I had paid for it...but since it was free, they were OK. I will ask for more egg rolls instead next time.I don't usually eat egg foo young so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like, but this was a little too plain for my tastes. It wasn't bad. It wasn't good. It was just there and we ate it.========================================Now the good stuff:The rest of the orders we got satisfied our craving for a chinese dinner. We sampled from everything family style. Lots left over for everyone else as they got home from work and lots left over for us for lunch the next day.The orange chicken tasted just like what one would expect from orange chicken. Lots of sauce. It was crunchy and saucy in each bite. It soaked up enough sauce as to be flavourful yet had some texture. Son ate it up. I ate it up. I think panda express has better orange chicken but panda doesn't deliver does it. Nope!I liked the Beef pepper steak. Could have been more beef than pepper but I have to tell you the beef was a good texture and taste. The sauce was great on the rice. It's ironic that it costs more than the orange chicken because you really get a LOT more chicken from that...than beef from this dish.The chicken fried rice went quickly. Just good basic fried rice.We also got a container of plain steamed rice for each large entree I'd ordered. I'll probably make my own fried rice another night with it because we have so much rice leftover. So...neat because we eventually get another meal out of this in a round about way.========================================I will continue ordering from them, but I'll change up my order next time until I hit a short list of "go-to" entrees. The first on that list is the orange chicken.
1	My first 1 star. I got the teriyaki chicken cause I find this dish hard to mess up... they messed it up! It was bland, the sauce was literally right out of the bottle and the rice was dry. This place would have gotten a 2 star if it didn't reek of raw sewage. Yes I ate there anyway... I was starving and my bike was overheating. Not one of my best decisions but one I will have to live with. I will not go back... ever! Kind of what you should expect from a place called China Joe's.
1	Cashier could barely speak English that she messed up my order after telling her what I wanted repeatedly. Food was also bland and tasted old.
4	Best chinese fast food in Henderson.  I have been coming here for 8 years and my favorite item on the menu is the Wor Won Ton soup. My husband loves the General Chicken and the Chicken Fried Rice is also excellent.  What I particularly like about China Joe's is that they do not bury everything in thick, pasty sauces.  The sauces are good, but the food does not drown in them.It is very casual dining and I always carry-out.  China Joes also delivers to my area which is an extra bonus.The facility is clean and the employees are friendly.
2	Growing up in Hawaii, I've been fortunate to have been exposed to a lot of Asian foods.  Chinese is my favorite of all Asian cuisines.  Before I go through the list of items I ordered, I would like to preface by saying that I really appreciate them catering to my last minute delivery order at 9:00pm last night, as they close at 9:30pm.  Alrighty, here goes nothing:Pot Stickers (8pcs) for $4.95-Stuffed with vegetables and pork, accompanied with a sweet soy dipping sauce.  Had it been more crispy, I would have enjoyed it more.  I actually enjoyed the leftovers cold and straight from the refrigerator, rather than when it arrived at my doorstep.Pork Fried Rice for $4.95- This dish should have been called the Pork with MSG fried rice. Holy cow! No wonder my leg was tingling shortly after eating this.  I'm sure they cook the rice with oyster sauce and soy sauce, just to name a few.  The rice did have a good pork to rice ratio.  Brownie points!Beef with Oyster Sauce for $7.95 (Large)- MSG also included.  Although similar tastes with the pork fried rice, I thought this was the best dish last night.  Reason being, there was a variety of vegetables with different textures that all came together for me in the dish.  Start with the tender beef (obviously not a vegetable, but a component of the dish nonetheless), added with crunchy water chestnuts, soft bambo shoots, my ever-so favorite, baby corn, mushrooms which already offers a unique texture, onions and chinese peas.  I really enjoyed this dish because of all that variety!Lemon Chick for $7.45 (Large)- Next time I know NOT to order this one.  Where do I start.  I didn't care for the breading on the chicken.  It was a more denser version of a tempura batter and if you've had any tempura-ed item before, you might know what I'm talking about.  The goal of the batter is to make it crispy, but because there's so much of it, it ends up being chewy.  That's what I experienced last night.  Then I took the liberty of deconstructing the chicken because it was REALLY dry.  As I suspected: Dark meat...but really overcooked dark meat chicken.  To top it off, I think they put Knox gelatin in the lemon sauce.  Sitting out on my counter for 15 minutes while I eat my food, I noticed that the sauce started to form into a gelatin-type consistency.  Not good.Let's be honest.  "I've experienced better," doesn't mean I won't be back.  It's one of the only Chinese food options I have to choose from in my area.  Last night I was hungry.  Last night I didn't want fast food.  Last night, I went on Yelp and tried to find a restaurant still open at 9pm that delivered and wasn't covered in red sauce and pepperoni.  That's when China Joes saved the day to feed my hunger.
3	Please don't judge me as I chose convenience again.  The last time I wrote a review for this place I gave them a 2 star.  This time, I chose to up the rating just a little.  I ordered a few things and two of them were good tonight. I ordered the beef with oyster sauce (larger size), sweet and sour pork (larger size) and an order of the potstickers.  My bill came out to $25 which is fine because I know I'll get up to 4 meals from this entire order.  I've gotta say that the beef with oyster sauce is really growing on me a lot.  The beef is super tender, the water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, bell peppers, onions, etc. is all really good.  I made my own rice tonight because I prefer the stickier type of rice.  I thought the combination was a flavor explosion.  The oyster sauce is definitely a great component that ties the entire dish together!  My second favorite thing tonight were the potstickers.  The outside was the epitome of crunchy.  The potstickers were stuffed with pork and veggies.  Super flavorful and served with a soy dipping sauce.  Personally, I didn't think the sauce was needed.  I think they used a little vinegar, but the potstickers were good on it's own.The one dish I did not like this time was the sweet and sour pork.  Chunks of pork battered and deep fried, served with chunks of peppers and onions.  The sweet red sauce is served on the side.  The only thing I didn't like was that the batter was so thick that they had to fry the pork longer than usual which made it super hard.  Hope your teeth are strong, because you're going to need it!  LOL!All in all, China Joe's doesn't stack up to my favorite (Joyful House), but since Spring Mountain is 15+ miles away...China Joe's will have to do! LOL
3	Not the best but does the job.I live all the way out by Lake Las Vegas so my delivery options are not huge but on random Chinese delivery cravings China Joe's does the job, The people on the phone are always nice foods decent noting special. Their Generals chicken is good but they put it in a styrofoam box and it's a really hot food so the box looks melted when it gets to you not a big fan of that. I'll probably order from them again, hopefully i remember to tell them no styrofoam boxes.
2	They delivered so I was happy, but the food was fair at best.  They were very polite on the phone and when delivering the food.  In a pinch would order again.
3	In the old part of Henderson it is OK. Hit or miss really. But when it's a hit it is great!
4	This is not the best Chinese around, but given the very short list of choices on my side of town (that deliver), China Joe's does the job.  We've eaten here several times - once dine-in and the rest delivery.  Here's the scoop:On the plus side:*Service is super friendly and delivery is quick*Food is consistently good and hot upon delivery*Sweet & Sour chicken is our fave - it's never over or under cooked and they serve the sauce on the side so it's not soggy when it gets to your door.*Love the cream cheese wontons - and we always end up with a free order with delivery.*Prices are very reasonable and they are not skimpy on sauces, condiments or cookies.  :)The not-so-plus side:*Hot & sour soup... It looked like jarred brown gravy with a few bamboo shoots. It also had a really strange aroma that I couldn't quite place but it was very unpleasant as was the taste.  Nothing like any hot & sour soup I've had before.*Potstickers. I can't really complain about these because they really were pretty good,  but I wasn't expecting them to be deep fried.  I think my idea of "potstickers" is actually the Chinese dumpling, so I can't really fault them for this, just know ahead of time they are deep fried (and a bit greasy because of that).In the end, whenever we are too lazy to go out and are wanting Chinese, we call China Joe's.
1	The food was so bad it's the first time in my life I have ever called a delivery place for a refund and to pick up their unedible food. Absolutely disgusting! The food came in a bag full of its own juice (spilled over) the kung pao celery (since the handful of spongy undercooked chicken pieces were hardly visible) our order was incorrect with no cream cheese wontons and some foil wrapped thing I think may have been chicken instead of the bbq robs we paid for. The only thing that may had been edible, had the other dish not completely saturated it with juice, was possibly the fried rice but the shrimp didn't taste cooked. We finally said to each other "this food isn't edible" and broke down and called. Dont waste your money, you will be disappointed!
5	I love getting delivery from this place, they are insanely fast and the food is pretty good. We have tried a lot of different things, and everything is decent. Love the fast delivery.
3	In my opinion, the food is pretty good. I love their mongolian beef and cashew chicken, so delish, especially as leftovers cause you can reheat it on a pan and chop it up all together on top of some rice. But my main reason for 3 stars is because the store itself... smells. I'm not talking "oh its just chinese food" smell. It smells like a sewage blew up in a locker room. Is that place sanitary? Burn some incense, spray some febreeze, there's a dollar store right next to you, get some candles in there!
