5	I've been going there for years - always happy. Was there last week as the idiot lights pertaining to brakes and ABS were lighted on my dash. They did inspection and nothing was wrong with the brakes system parts. They ended up scanning the vehicle to find error codes for a module - which is a dealer issue, not theirs. Didn't charge me a thing - very helpful.
4	I was complaining about the lack of detail the place who has done my brakes for about 15 years and my business landlord suggested I try this place.  My dealer had told me 18,000 miles ago I was in eminent danger of running out of brakes.  I made an appointment for first thing on a Saturday recently to have my brakes inspected fully thinking I was going to buy front pads.  They had a problem getting a full staff on time that day and even though I showed up right at the opening bell a couple of walk ins were already on the racks and it took 3/4 of an hour before I was taken to see my car.  Brakes had plenty of pad left.  They pointed out some items that may need work soon and 15 minutes later they had my car buttoned up and I was on my way down the road.  No charge.  I liked the way I was treated as well as the way they were treating the other customers in the waiting room.  I will indeed take my car here when I finally need brakes.
1	Took my truck to get brake fluid flush and rear brakes adjusted. Drove my truck 4 miles and the rear brakes locked up and started smoking. Took the truck back and they said the mechanic over adjusted the rear brakes.
5	First impression... Neat, clean, nice and welcoming! Let's face it, I'm a chick so I'm quit hesitant to get anything done on my truck. But I literally was welcomed with a wave, a smile and a warm greeting. I pulled in about 5 minutes ago for an oil change and it already looks like their halfway done! I will definitely be back and I'm going to tell my husband about this place as well! He's going to be so jealous! ;  ) good job Brake Masters!
