5	This is a really good Learning is Fun. It usually has what I want/need, but science items become sparse during science fair project time, which is usually around the same time every year for all schools. They have a lot of stuff that I can't even find at Walmart. The employees are nice and you can even sign up to be a member for free, which allows you to get coupons/discounts.
5	Wow... this place is crazy cool.  They have so many different learning tools... parents and teachers could spend hours in here and not soak everything in.  We kinda did, actually... spend at least an hour there!  We searched out 'Learning Is Fun' because my friend was in from Japan and wanted some workbooks to take back with her.  She's an English tutor there but it's harder to get what she needs in Japan.  She was sooo happy to have the amazing selection that this store offered.  It's just a great large learning supply store with a lot of selection.See ya there!
2	If you are rich all that is cool is gathered together for you. If you aren't there is nothing here that you can't find in a Homeschooling catalog, or the Internet. I have never had good luck with the staff, either. of course they accept credit cards, you need one if you buy pencils or something.
1	This store has closed along with the one in Henderson, NV.  Only two locations remain they are in New Mexico and Washington.
