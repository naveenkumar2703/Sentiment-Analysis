3	Without a doubt, very nice furniture. But comparatively more expensive than other places. Was not thrilled with the customer service, you'd think for spending some thousands of dollars you would get free leather conditioner an/or free shipping. Girl told us she would call back to give us some names of places for free donation/removal, she didn't of course. The owner of Perlora ought to take some MBA basics of Sales Management to instruct his employees on the limits of authority they have (if he gives any) so they can speak intelligently of what they can do to make a sale, as well as teaching some plain and simple customer intimacy virtues.
5	Had a great time here today loved the atmosphere and the customer service. Lots of cool designs and styles. I highly recommend this place! Awesome staff and awesome furniture.
