3	Sonoran Hills Park is located on the backside of Williams near the local Pinnacle Peak School which is part of the Paradise Valley United School District.  You can walk this park and the there is plentiful parking nearby. Have fun!
5	I recently discovered this park and was so excited! They have two playgrounds, one for younger and one for older kids. They also have two sets of swings and lots of grass to run and play in. It was very quiet and calm when we went which I love. I will now be a regular at this park I am sure!
5	Great park for small toddlers. There are two sized jungle gyms, swings, many picnic tables, bathrooms, a field, basketball and tennis courts! What more could you ask for, oh shade you say? Well your wish is my command, except for the swings, the climbing structures and picnic tables are shaded! Not a ton of people/kids here, which may be a problem for some but for others it might be a positive thing!
