1	For the life of me, I can't figure out why Wyndham would put this place within their family of properties. This is the worst place I've ever stayed and I've stayed at some pretty raunchy places. There's a strip club next door so that'll give you an idea of the type of clientele they have - whores and crack heads. Trash wes strewn about even though there are trash cans all around. In the 2 days we were there, none of it was ever picked up (walked by the same trash at least 1/2 dozen times...hey, I ain't touchin it). Felt like I was in the ghetto. The room was awful - stained everything and no way to get comfortable with the spring poking my a$$. The front desk staff was rude. What they pass for a continental breakfast is a joke. Old muffins, that's about it. And, I like a little sugar in my coffee but they said they didn't have any (and she very obviously really didn't give a s%*t that they didn't).It's cheap and the WiFi is free (not very secure - the password is 12345abcde - a good indication of how much of a joke this place is). Those are the only good things I can say about this place.I'd sleep on a park bench before I'd ever go here again.
1	What a complete and total dump.  Really, if you can't keep driving then get arrested or something.  Whatever you do don't stay in this nasty place.  I will never make the mistake of staying in a Knight's Inn again and, in fact, will question any Wyndham property.  The place is completely worn out.  No bucks spent in upkeep.  The phones don't work, the lights don't work.  I don't think it was a safe environment.  We were remote and exhausted or I would have kept going.  Whatever you do, don't stay in a Knight's Inn.
