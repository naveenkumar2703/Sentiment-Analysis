3	A skate shop in the Galleria mall its a little over priced and a little cramped but they have a good selection and 20% off the day I was there so I got a set of spitfire wheels and bearings for $20. They carry their own brand of skateboard gear and they are very helpful & friendly not pushy and over bearing like alot of mall places I visited here.
4	When did skate shoes get so expensive??? It's all good though because they last forever!The service here is great, I like the layout of the shop even though it is small. It's nice and clean and again the staff is very helpful.
3	This place is ok. This is the third time I've come to Industrial and it's always a hit or miss. This time is a miss. They didn't have any of the shoes I wanted in my size (all out). They were nice enough to contact another shop to see if they had them in stock. The customer service is great just wished they kept their store stocked.
1	Bought a pair of shoes for my son who just beat cancer.  When he tried them on in the store they felt ok, but when we got them home and he wore them for a couple of days, the shoes caused tremendous pain in my son's right foot. I tried to return the shoes 6 days after purchase and was denied refund because of the wear and tear on the shoes. It does not say anything about this on the receipt.  It only states refunds are given before 30 days with receipt.  Now I'm stuck with a pair of shoes we can't use and out $60. We will NEVER shop here again!!
