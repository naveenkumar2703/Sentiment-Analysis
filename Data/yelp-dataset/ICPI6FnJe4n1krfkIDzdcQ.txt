2	Avoid the inside for business transactions. The teller has a separate window and line but they seem to take everyone at that window. I always wait. It is very frustrating at this branch. They used to staple my receipts and thats over. Probably cutting costs. The drive thru is better. Still no staples. People notice the little things.
2	This location is pretty good, the people are all very nice. But I hate this bank. I hate the online services, they suck. All I want to do is make separate areas where I can put money for things like Vacation or Education. To do this, I have to create differet savings accounts, which costs 25$ each. So I called them and asked if there is any other way I can do this, without creating a shit ton of accounts just so I can physically see how much I have for each subject. "You can create a savings goal." is the response. Cool, so I do that. And ow many savings goals can you create for each account? ONE! How the hell is this suppose to help me!? I do not want to create a fuck ton of accounts, just to be able to separate my money. Is it so hard to let us do this!?
1	Wouldn't let me get something nortized because did not have an account with them ... My friend went there the other day to do it and charged her and wouldn't let me do it....   Horrible!!!
