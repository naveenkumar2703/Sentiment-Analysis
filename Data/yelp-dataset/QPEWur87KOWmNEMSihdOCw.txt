3	Maddies was interesting. They basically offer 5 or 6 models of different furniture sets or pieces (bedroom, entertainment, office, etc) and from those 5 or 6 models they let you pick from lots of colors or wood stains. From that it reminded me a little of Ikea, but on a quality end it was nothing like Ikea! They only used Oak or Alder, which are both hard woods and very durable. Plus the manufacturing plant is right behind the showroom, so everything is made right there. They have an "As Is" area which has some good pieces. Not a lot of variety in styles, but overall good quality furniture, that is worth the time to check out.Take Note: Open to the Publilc Saturdays 10am - 4pm, Weekdays by Appointment Only.
5	Great deals!  Being from Hawaii, and having to furnish a new house, it was nice to catch a break by finding a TV console table for about $250.  The bonus was that this table was about 6.5 feet long with a great dark brown stain on it.  Ryan and his crew even helped me stuff it into my SUV.  Everything here is affordable and quality and they will even custom build and stain pieces as well.  Like the other reviewer said, the quality here is worth coming out on a Saturday or Sunday to take a look!
5	We recently bought a bedroom set from Maddies. The price was excellent, the quality was excellent, the delivery and set up was excellent. This store had since gone out of business. Sorry to see them go.
5	Maddies on Madison is awesome! This store has such beautiful pieces and the owners were so very helpful with satisfying our purchase. I highly recommend checking this place out before going anywhere else!
