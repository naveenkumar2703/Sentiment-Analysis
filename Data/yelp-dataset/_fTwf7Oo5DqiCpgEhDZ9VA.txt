3	Air Jordan! need I say more?
2	When they didn't have my size I asked if they could call the Metro store. When he was on hold for less the a minute a different customer asked for some help, he hangs up goes to help that person. When I ask what they said he tells me they didn't answer that he has to help these ppl then he'll call back. - went to Champs and they were a 10 on service and didn't get the sales person commission feel. (If you aren't buying I'm not helping)
3	The staff was friendly and told me where I could go to find what I wanted.  I appreciated the information.
5	This is now the 3rd pair of shoes I have bought from Finish Line. Not sure why I never reviewed them before. They deserve 5 stars.  Eric is the manager I have always dealt with. He knows what he is talking about and makes it an easy transaction. No obnoxious up sells or anything.  Highly recommend.
