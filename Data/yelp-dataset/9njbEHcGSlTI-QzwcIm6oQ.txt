1	They let go of the good loving and caring teachers!! Now both locations can suck... Parents are not blind .... You hire cheap staff parents will notice !! Finding  good people in Henderson is a hard thing to do .... You let go of 2 of the girls my son LOVED the most!!!!!!
5	My daughter loves her teachers here and the manager works with me when I have an issue with something.  She is very helpful and understanding.  I would recommend this childcare center.
5	My son has been going here for about 5 months. It's his first time in child care. He loves it here. The teachers are remarkable. He is learning sooo much! The school is extremely clean. The teachers are very organized and there are no behavior problems or issues with the children. Even when my son goes to kindergarten next year, I will definately make sure he gets to spend time with Ms. Chrystal and the rest of her staff.
