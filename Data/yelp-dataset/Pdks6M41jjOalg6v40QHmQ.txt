1	One of the worse dining experiences I've ever had. Our "waiter" gregorio, screwed up every aspect of our meal, including not splitting our check properly as requested, and mixing the receipts up afterwards. Then today I realized that he double charged us for our meal and tip. Now we have to deal with getting our extra $ back.   DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL.
4	There was pretty steady line here for a 10am  arrival on a Saturday but we were seated promptly.  Service was fast and friendly.  I ordered the BLT with French Fries and a Bloody Mary.  Both were delicious and made perfectly.  The BLT had the right amount of bacon, mayo and of course lettuce & tomato on sour dough.  I ate it all before I even thought of taking a picture.  The Bloody Mary's were $3. I was expecting much more for a casino cafe.  I wasn't sure if that was a special price or not but I will take it!
2	This place kind of reminds me of the Grand Cafe in Station Casinos. Nothing in particular stood out except for the fact that it's located inside one of my favorite casinos (The Golden Nugget). I'm an eggs benedict type of guy, so that's what I order. Typical eggs benedict with decently prepared hollandaise sauce and not overcooked. Service could have been better though. I think our waitress only came around a couple of times. She kind of looked like she was really looking forward to going home. If only they understood that good, friendly service would get you a bigger tip. Oh well...
