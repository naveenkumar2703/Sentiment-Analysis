4	This store has gone through some management changes and has suffered in the past, no longer! This store is packed with new and used music, movies and games. I find the staff to be helpful and friendly, I feel like they appreciate my business. This is a cool neighborhood "old school" place to shop for tunes and movies. Give it a shot, you will not be disappointed.
5	First time selling here and will be back here if we need to sell CDs. The staff was super nice and was patient with the crate load of CDs we had! I believe they pay more for CDs, my cousin sold to Zia and got way less. Also if you have some CDs you want to sell and want to see what the current selling price is, just go to the F.Y.E website, enter Cd name and they will give you a price for your CD! This came in very handy so you know which CDs you really wanna bring for the most buck!Takes about 20-25 mins for them to process your stuff which is quick when your looking at all the cool stuff they have in the store. When they are down they give you an itemized receipt of all the CDs they bought from you so you know what they were worth in the end! I think my hubby teared a little letting some of those CDs, very proud of him for being able to let go hehe. Glad we came here though, and it's close to home! :)
5	I used to go to the f.y.e. in Tempe a lot for some cheap used CD blu-ray and some electronics. They closed recently so I had to travel far here. The girl cashier was really nice. The speaker I was getting has old discount price tags on them (which should be taken down already), but she still gave me the discount. All in all it's a nice place for us poor students. I hope they stay strong in the digital age.
