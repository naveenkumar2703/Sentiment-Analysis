5	I had my very first personal training session with Angela and it was amazing!! She went over what areas I wanted to work on, gave me a personalized diet plan to start following and homework to get me active everyday. I haven't workout in over a year so I am terribly out of shape and self conscience but she made me feel totally comfortable and got me super inspired to change my bad habits! Plus the decor is super cute it's not like any other gym out there. I can't wait for my next session!
5	It's great finally finding a personal trainer who truly believes in me & my goals. I'm so glad that personal trainer is Angela!  I love that she cares about my progress & ensures that I stay on track. She pushes me out of my comfort zone each workout which helps build on my confidence & I truly appreciate her for that. The atmosphere at Mint Body is friendly & welcoming.  I have a new found for Mint!
5	I attended the pre-opening free boot camp and the trainers were SO fun, so positive and super encouraging.  All the trainers at Mint Body are so welcoming and have a genuine personal interest in their clients goals and take time to put together a custom workout plan and meal plans too!  My trainer Angela, is so caring and goes the extra mile to make sure I am keeping on track.  The group fitness classes are fabulous!!! Definitely come for the Zumba nights!  What a fun fun fun workout.  The studio is adorable!  Find it in the JD Homestead complex on the east side of Gilbert just south of Elliot.
5	Just 2wks in training with Angela and I'm already noticing weight change and definition! Haven't set foot in a gym over 7yrs and I'm in love with the training! Angela helps push me and keeps me motivated and focused! This is definitely a lifestyle I want to keep!!! Thank you Angela!!!
