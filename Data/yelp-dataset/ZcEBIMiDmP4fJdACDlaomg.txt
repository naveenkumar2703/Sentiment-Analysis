1	Over priced burnt coffee, bad service, breakfast sandwich was greasy
1	It's infrequent for me to find something completely terrible. And when I do have less-than-stellar experiences, I usually don't bother to review them.Thanks Yelp app.I ordered two large lattes because the LVH discount book gives you $4 off said order. The good news is that the two large coffees "only" cost $7.47. The bad news is that they taste like a watered down mess. Granted, it's a single shot of espresso in a 20oz cup. But still, it just tastes off. Burned milk? Who knows.Back to the good news, I feel much, much better about the lattes I make at home.
