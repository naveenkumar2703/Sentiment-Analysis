4	Starbucks is hurting my wallet by being inside grocery stores and now Macy's!!! However, I can't complain because they are always around when I need my fix! My favorite lately is the skinny vanilla latte since I am watching the calories. My all time favorite is the white mocha. The prices are creaping towards the insane but for convenience and consistent quality it is worth it. I don't like their coffe, hence the 4 stars. Just their espress drinks and green tea lattes! Staff is always friendly and fast at this location. When they were packed a couple weeks ago they had someone come out and take orders in line while someone was ringing and they got a line of about 15 people out in minutes! Very impressive!
1	The worst coffee I have ever had from a Starbucks!! And they don't accept gift cards!!
1	Every time I go through the drive thru I'm waiting for at least 20 minutes. I thought this was a fluke at first but tried a couple more times with the same result. Which sucks cause they are the only Starbucks with a drive thru by my house. Most of the time I have my toddler with me and don't want to have to get her in and out of her car seat.
