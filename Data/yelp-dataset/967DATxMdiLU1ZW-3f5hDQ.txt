1	Disaster. This place is a nightmare. It's relatively new and already doesn't look it. And, I had one of the worst checkout experiences of my life. I got in line and the line was long and getting longer. There were 2 cashiers one of them had a very large transaction so the front end supervisor hopped on. All of a sudden, one of the cashiers, who was dressed as Bon Qui Qui, stopped ringing and started processing her go-backs IN SLOW MOTION. She would periodically look up and notice the line getting progressively longer, but continued to move at the pace of molasses in winter. She has a promising future at the DMV. After nearly 10 minutes of this the front end supervisor told her that she wasn't supposed to start that until 2:45 (it was now 2:40 and she had been at this for 10 minutes) and that it shouldn't take her more than 5 minutes. Clearly she hasn't seen her in action. Or inaction. The girl acted like this was new information (I doubt it) and went ahead and started ringing. I swear there was steam coming off the entire line. It was totally ridiculous. I will absolutely never shop here again.

More registers, at first my concern was the wait though they have plenty of registers only had one cashier but in time 2 more showed up so the wait was not to bad. I think this was a great Ross and I will definitely come back. Also if you want to get through faster than in the line they do have a rack to put your hangers. Only thing I didn't like was having to grab my own receipt
2	Every time I go into this store I feel very uncomfortable! The security guard followed me around the store peeking at me from behind aisles! Not so slick, and very annoying!
