5	This is an amazing store with a rich, warm vibe and a very welcoming atmosphere. If you are looking for unique home accessories, interesting furniture accent pieces, embellished candles, exquisite baby gifts, extravagant pillows and lighting that's far from ordinary ... this is your place. Really. Located next to AJ's in the new Scottsdale North marketplace at Scottsdale Road and Lone Mountain, Casa Paloma is always interesting, alway warm and inviting and you know what? always affordable ... despite its North Scottsdale zip code. Check it out! It's new and your neighbor probably hasn't been there yet ........
4	I love this store. Really, I could live there. Aj's right next door. Already decorated just the way I like. Just make room for my bed. I have never went there and not been able to find the perfect gift, much less something for me.
5	Not only does Casa Paloma carry gorgeous furnishings and home decor, but they always have the BEST gifts! Casa Paloma is a must "stop in" when I need a gift for anyone!  I have picked up baby gifts, hostess gifts, birthday gifts, and more!  Also, for Old World interior design, Diane is the most talented!!  One of my favorite store is Arizona!
