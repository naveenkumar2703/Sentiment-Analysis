5	This store was really great, the service was quick and fast and if you have any questions in this store, don't be afraid to ask. They will give you the low down and how much quality and care it took to make a product. I love how the jackets on the zipper they have this emergency hair tie. Which is pretty cute and very practical. They thought up everything for the life of a runner, yoga lover or a person that loves to be healthy and fit. The clothes are expensive but they guarantee 5 years. The price ranges from $15.00 socks to $200.00 jackets, and $100.00 pants. The pants are tailored to your length and you will be able to pick it up in a few days. Try it out and see if you like their stuff. I know I am starting to love it. :)
5	Best athletic store I've ever been too! The product is wonderful and worth every penny, the service is amazing as everyone is soOo knowledgeable and seem very happy with what they are doing, and the energy is different from anywhere else in Vegas...
5	Each and every single piece of Lulu-wear I own is amazing.  Lululemon is offers active wear and products geared towards yogis and runners, both for women and men.  Everything is made with quality material and is so comfortable.. and comfort is key when it comes to athletic wear. The first time I stumbled into Lululemon, not only was I happy with the items I'd purchased but I was even more impressed with the service and experience they provide their clients.  It has the feel of a boutique, yoga studio, and a place where individuals can share their passion for fitness, wellness, and efforts to help the local community grow.   The store transforms into a studio offering free yoga classes every Sunday.  Such a wonderful way to give back to their clients and support the local fitness community.  So inspired by this concept...They have an extensive line of sports bras, tanks, and comfy leggings, all in different shapes and colors. Really clever accessories, too.  Though it may not be cheap, you are not getting cheated of quality.  But beware, certain styles are seasonal and will be discontinued... so if you find something you like, just buy it.  I love lululemon athletica.  You have helped me redirect my retail therapy towards active wear that I will actually put to good use.
5	Attraction: free weekly yoga classes, cool atheletic wear!It's embarassing for me to say... I'm a closet lululemon junkie.I used to laugh at the Stepford-wife-esque women padding around in their lululemon attire with their blinged out cellphones. Then, I tried on some of their yoga/athletic clothes and realized that these women were on to something. Although I don't do yoga (so I feel like a bit of a poser in the store), the clothes are amazingly comfortable and durable. I've purchased a coat, two tops, and some shorts and they have lasted a long time.Breathable, lightweight, fashionable, functional, well-designed. These are the keywords here. A lot of their clothes don't even look like they're athletic wear which makes it very versatile. Years after I purchased my coat, people still ask me where I got it from (if they're not Canadian).For those who do yoga, each lululemon store has a scheduled weekly yoga studio (did I mention that it's free?) in their store. They make a point to use pictures using local athletes as their models. So despite the fact that it's a chain store, it still retains a local feeling to it.Is it overpriced? Yes and no. They often have sales so their items are more reasonable but it is still rather expensive at full price. The quality is great so it really lasts a long time.I have to say, their Canadian stores seem to have a better selection and more discounted items. However, I'm just pleased that they have an outlet here in Las Vegas for people to check out.
5	I love going to this store! The sales people are friendly and willing to help. They have a pretty good selection of workout clothing for both men and women. I also visit every now and then to check out their sale rack, which has a fabulous selection of marked down pieces if you time it right. I've been a fan of Lulu ever since I bought my first t-shirt from them. The shirt I got was super soft (like a well worn shirt) yet breathable enough for intense workouts. Best of all, their clothes showcase your body. Whenever I wear their work-out crops, I immediately feel more confident as they make my legs and derrriere look amazing :) The store is located on the second floor - close to the Dillard's side of the Fashion Show Mall.
5	Best yoga wear in town! It's definitely true when they say "you get what you pay for." While the clothing does not come cheap, it will last you a very very long time. So comfy, so soft, so appropriate for any yoga move imaginable.Worried about spending too much money on yoga wear? Trust me...it's well worth it!Worried about the yoga wear not fitting? Don't worry...they do FREE tailoring. They'll measure and adjust according to your height and it'll be ready for pick up in 3 days.Namaste!
5	I showed up at 9:00 am on Sunday for yoga and t was great. There were some really advanced people as well as some beginners. Everyone mixed really well. We also had a special instructor too. I didn't buy anything at this store, but judging by how nice everyone was at yoga, I am sure the retail help here is great. I do own tons of Lululemon apparel though and  it has great quality and really takes the wears and tares well.
5	This product is by far the best I have ever worn/used for anything you do. I love the way it makes me feel! The culture is amazing and I love the staff like family! You have to just go in to see what I mean!!!
5	You get what you pay for when you come to Lululemon. The prices are bit high but the clothes feel absolutely wonderful against your body.The staff here are unbelievably wonderful, everyone was so helpful, informative and friendly.
5	My sister and I visited this store while on vacation and we both had a wonderful experience! Curtis helped us and he was amazing! He was very friendly and helpful and explained the materials to us and also how the garments should fit. We both walked out of the store with a couple of items and a great recommendation to a wonderful cafe nearby that sells amazing vegan desserts.I signed up for a yelp account just to post this review for Curtis. If you are reading this, thanks again!
4	These stores are great, and this location fits that mould. I'm often amazed what's available for fitness clothes (beyond the expect Big Five type stuff you'd imagine).Definitely sleek in contour and vivid in colors, lululemon makes you want to reach for the stars. Really. I feel that if I'm going to get serious about yoga or working out, the clothes might help. And vice versa. With the nicer duds, I'm feeling more confident and comfortable to really go for it.I've never done their weekly free yoga classes on Sundays, but it sounds great. So, amidst the hubbub of the very busy Fashion Mall, it's nice to pop into a place that is like its own little good-vibe Island.
4	I hate to love this place. The clothes are so comfortable, great fitting, and stylish. "Lulu" is the epitome of excellent athletic attire. I just wish they were a bit more affordable, then they would receive a 5 star rating from me hands down.
4	I stopped in here because I realized that after doing yoga in clothes that weren't yoga-appropriate, I would need something better. I was looking for quality and durability and it certainly can be found in these clothes.They have a huge selection in brights and neutrals and in many styles. I loved the pants SO much. They are very expensive, but the quality is amazing. They do have a sale rack which has incredible sales if you can find what you like.The only reason that I gave this four stars instead of five, is because the staff is just really stand-offish. I walked in wearing jeans and a t-shirt with a hoodie and definitely felt out of place. I was ignored for the first 15 minutes until I finally asked a question. I asked one of the salesgirls to find me a certain pair of yoga pants in my size. I told her I'd be looking at shirts when she came back. After 15 more minutes I went looking for her and she was folding clothes. I asked where my pants were and she said the girl in the back (that finds sizes that aren't on the floor) didn't answer the phone. Uh, okay, so just leave me walking around. That's awesome. Not really. I also expect that if you're in sales (as I am) that you will bring me alternatives. I told her I was new to yoga, I thought that might activate her helpful button, but it did not. So, the salespeople are really super unhelpful. Seriously. If I didn't love the quality of clothes I probably wouldn't go back because of that.
1	***UPDATE!!!** * I went to use my gift card from back when I returned some unworn clothes.  Tried on a nice pink top and loved it.  The only problem was it had a stain right in the middle of the front.  I asked the girl if there was a shirt in the same size without a stain.  She brought it to me and I immediately bought it without even looking..  stupid I know.. This new shirt has a RIP on the front middle.. exactly where the stain was.  A rip!!  I can't even wear it.  The horrible part is that I kept the shirt in the bag for about 3 weeks in my closet and forgot about it.  Their limit to return items is 2 weeks.This sales chick knowingly gave me a ripped shirt and it all went according to plan.. I'm now stuck with a $60 useless ripped top.  Thanks, girl!!***  old review ***I spent about $1000 on work out clothes and was expecting high quality...  boy was I wrong!  Each top I bought was around $60 and I can barely even hold one of them long enough to put it on without something getting on it and staining it.  I've never had that kind of issue with any other piece of clothing except maybe white jeans.  The clothes I bought ranged in colors from black to baby pinks and neon.  I even had to exchange one top because I realized it was stained before I even got to wear it and it still had the tags on it.I've washed one of my baby blue tops about 4 times now and it already looks dingy and old.  The store is great and the staff is nice but I recommend only buying dark colors or skipping this place completely.
5	The prices are super high but this brand has been the BEST clothing I have owned for Pilates. The fabric hugs your skin and body so the fit smooths out your figure even more. I love the feel of the Astro pants, Groove pant and the Studio pant. Great for all shapes and sizes of women. The quality is so good the material will last years if you take care of it and never use fabric softener or a hot dryer.  I started wearing Lululemon ten years ago when it was only available in Canada. It's great to be able to go to the store here in Las Vegas.  The styles are really nice and most of the styles are timeless so it won't fade out of style. I wear my Lululemon to Pilates, traveling, hiking, mornings for errands, everywhere! I'm pretty frugal but I don't mind spending for something that will last me and feels good when I have it on. This store offers free yoga classes. Check their Facebook page or website for the schedule. If you don't have a mat they will provide one. It's usually in the earlier morning before the store opens.
3	I loved that this Lulu had a huge selection colors and patterns compared to my local Lulu store; however the service at this location is seriously lacking.  Prices are well Lulu prices - expensive!  However the quality is well worth it!
5	Sunday morning, free yoga class at 9:30am. Anyone who is interested in learning or practice with teachers from all over the valley should attend these classes. It is a great way to get a feel for an instructor before committing to any one studio. Each month a new yogi will come into the store to instruct in a different style of yoga. If you are not into vinyasa, than maybe the next month will bring in ashtanga or hatha. The teachers tend to vary up the level of difficulty so that no individual student gets bored or restless. If one pose is too easy, they will suggest a variation to keep it challenging.Be sure to get there early because the classes fill up quickly.
4	Super helpful on the phone. Gave us directions and looked for the top we were looking for to make sure it was in stock. Even with the big mall scene we were in and out in no time! Thanks ladies!
2	A crowded mess on Black Friday, but that can be overlooked.  But here's the deal, LULU...you know I love you, BUT...............if your return policy sucks and we all know (including you) that it does, don't get snarky about me asking for separate receipts for each item that I buy.  I was buying gifts and wanted a separate receipt for each recipient.  Sorry if that's inconvenient, but it's my money and I'm just trying to navigate your terrible return policy.  You need to deal.  Thanks.
5	Love love LOVE Lululemon!!  The colors and the fits are so fun and flattering!  Their workout clothes almost add pep to your step at the gym because their so cute.  And their also works for you.  The material absorbs sweat and helps with the sweat odor.  As for this store, the people who work here are always super nice and helpful!  And they wear the products so it helps give you an idea of what they look like on.  The only draw back to this brand/store is the prices.  Clothing from Lululemon is pretty pricy so be sure you try something on if you're unsure.
3	I've never purchased anything from Lululemon, but I love that they offer a free yoga class every Sunday morning. Each month it's a different instructor, and it's a great way to start the day.
5	I've always been a Nike girl...well, I still am but lululemon is just as rad. They have yoga pants, workout pants, jackets, sports bras, tops, headbands aka bang busters, socks, yoga mats, bags, water bottles and other yoga supplies. They also have yoga classes in-store on weekends which is pretty cool.The whole vibe of the store is positive. The store is bright and colorful yet calming. Even their shopping bags have positive messages written all over them. Price-wise, they're more expensive than bigger sporting brands. But most of their stuff is organic and very very comfortable. The employees here have pleasing personalities too. They're not annoying or pushy. They're just chill and helpful. The fitting rooms are huge you can do yoga in there! They have a clearance rack but of course, nothing in my size...but it's fine. I always walk away with tops and pants...I'm addicted to this place.
5	I was the first customer when they opened at 10AM on a Saturday, and luckily the mall was pretty much empty. The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about their products and explaining everything to a relative newbie. (All while never being pushy.)  I came to check out pants, but instead left with a cute jacket I found on the sale rack, a top, and a few other accessories. It's not cheap, but when you workout frequently you want something that is going to hold up well and you feel great in.A+ to the employees, you rock!
5	Only go to lululemon if you like awesomeness. If you don't then it's probably not he place for you. I damn love these cloths. I don't care how much they are I've never been so comfortable in anything before. I do buy the more professional looking cloths as a massage therapist I need to look good and be able to move well. These are perfect!!
3	3 stars... 3 stars is a good review to me... it takes a lot for me to say "woohoo as good as it gets".  LLL is expensive, but hey lets face it, nike has nothing on the style aspect.  I don't think they're pushy, its obvious theres no commission, but I can't stand it when they ask for your name at the fitting room and constantly holler "so and so hows it join in there" The company as a whole has very limited product runs so if you love it get it... the cut may be there next week but your print won't.  Its hit and miss with the sales people, I think their favorite question to ask is "how do you workout" (i mean its an athletic clothing co.) and when i say "oh just LVAC" 1/2 the time the convo continues and 1/2 the time I feel super judged that i don't go to aerial candle lit moonstone yoga or do my WOD's at the box (cross fit jargon)
4	I am a HUGE lulu fan! I basically live in their clothes. The quality is great because the colors don't fade, the material doesn't stretch out or shrink up when laundered, and somehow their pants give you a mini butt-lift! So why not 5 stars? For the first time in 6 years of shopping there I brought a $55 shirt back to try and exchange it for a smaller size. I told the woman how I ALWAYS wear a 6 so I didn't try the shirt on before buying it. Once I wore it is when I realized it was too big. So obviously the tag was torn off. She told me there was nothing they could do and to go down to the Taylor on the first floor and they could take the straps in for like $10. I went down there and they charged me $25 for the straps! When I picked it up the next day, they took the straps in too much so it was literally unwearable. That's a total of $75 spent on a shirt that I can never wear! I think they should have been a little more understanding since the cut of this shirt made their sizing inaccurate. I was just very disappointed in their customer service and lack of compassion to a loyal customer with no history of ever returning anything.
4	Some real good deals to be had for men's, and not just the bad colours or sizes lol. Men's on the right.Picked up a few anti-sweat for, by their standards, great prices: $39 golf shirt with collar and in black w/ grey trim by the buttons, regular $78.  that's a steal in my books.and also a V-neck t-shirt, light grey, for just $29.good service too, she gave me a big bag instead upon request; those little ones are useless lol.
1	I fell in love with Yoga years ago but the constant challenge is finding clothes that fit that aren't obscenely tight for my size and don't roll up or down in the wrong places.I routinely visit lululemon and love the clothes but they only go up to size 12.  Today I was on the hunt for a gift for someone who wears a zero (or 2 or 4 depending on what it is) and as usually, no one in the store even acknowledged I was there  I walked in.  No greeting.  Everyone else got one.  I flipped through racks looking at different versions of yoga tops and spent about 15 minutes while everyone around me was asked if they had questions or needed help.I have magical powers of invisibility!I became visible when I checked in and wrote my note and took a photo at which time the person behind the cash register walked up and said "Oh, are you taking pictures of our merchanidisin?"  My response was I take photos of as many places as I visit as possible to post on Yelp.,  She responded "well, I hope we get a good review"  I was quite frank and said no, it was not a good review and that this was the third time I have been in this store and was completely ignored because apparently the only people who need yoga stuff are smaller than the average woman.  (Ironically when you go to yoga... there are all shapes and sizes there and I may not be the smallest, I'm not the biggest, the best or the worst at it because as every instructor says "It's call Yoga Practice for a reason")To get away from my personal story and back to the conversation with the employee when I told her this was the third time I have been in the store and not been helped she said "we take this very seriously".  When I asked "how serious can you take it if this is my third time in your store and the third time I've been ignored?"I was about done at that point and said "Thanks anyway" and hit the door.Sadly, it's not a uncommon for a plus-size person to not receive service when shopping in non-plus size stores.  It happened to me today at the Black/White store too.  (I stopped in to look at jewelery!)   It used to be humiliating but now I just figure their bad luck.  My money is still in my wallet and not theirs.
4	I love this store! I usually order online on the official Lululemon website, but I do buy a few things when it's not in stock online and I also get my pants hemmed here. Staff is usually pretty chill and helpful when you need them. They do an amazing job on hemming my pants since their pants are pretty long and I'm only 5'1" haha. It's nice they offer complimentary hemming, but then again you're paying $$$ for a pair of Lulus. Their stuff known for being expensive but their clothes are SO much better and comfier than brands like Nike, and they don't have those dumb logos like Victoria's Secret's "PINK" across your ass. Not a fan of their yoga mats or headbands (they always seem to fall off my head) but I'm in love with their wunder unders, sport bras, and 105 singlets! I also got my bag from here few months ago which was reallyyy pricey, but it has all the right compartments, and holds my yoga mats underneath! It feels and looks durable so I am pretty sure it won't break like my previous Nike gym bag. I love Lululemon but I do wish their sales rack had more smaller sizes :( Whenever I pass by it, all the nice things are in the larger sizes only.
5	Cleanness: 5 starsThis is a brand new shop, I wouldn't expect anything less than a very clean facility. Hospitality: 5 startsI tried on several items, the staff was helpful to get sizes not on the shelf from the back promptly. I was also informed of their current sales and newest styles while I shopped. The ladies were happy to hold my selections at the front counter while I finished shopping.Value: 5 starsMy experience on value came while browsing a sale rack. These prices are usually 30-50% off and I found several items..Overall: this store is a great example of the brand and their customer service, I will be sure to stop back in on my next visit to Downtown Summerlin.
