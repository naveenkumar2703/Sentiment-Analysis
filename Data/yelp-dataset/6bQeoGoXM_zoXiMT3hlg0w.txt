5	I've called these guys a couple of times now and I will call them again. Not only do they show up when they say they will, they move quickly. I've been very impressed with the clean-up they do after the junk's been hauled. Their prices are reasonable and they're straight up about what you're going to pay before anything moves. Real professional company. I'd recommend them to anyone who has junk they need to get rid of.
5	This company is great!! Three pleasant and professional gentlemen arrived at our door less than an hour after we called. They efficiently removed our furniture and were on their way I would highly recommend this company!!
5	Use them! So accommodating, prices are listed online and pretty accurate. So helpful and fast and made our move out of state easier! When he pulled up in our driveway alone we were worried. We had couches, entertainment centers, tons of stuff we needed to get rid of and it was out last day in our home before selling. Couldn't get donation places to pick up but they said they will donate our items for us. He made it all fit and got it loaded like a magician. It was great. If you ever need junk removal I definitely recommend.
