5	Friendly staff and a the decor is great!!! Very nice barber shop!!
5	AMAZING! This place is a much needed addition to the Anthem community. I had a cut and shave ($30), which is EXTREMELY reasonable, and much less expensive than the guys down the street, and chain shop in Norterra.Both services were very detail oriented, and much time was taken. Do yourself a favor and pop in you'll definitely be glad that you did.
5	I am SO impressed with the haircut that Danny gave my son this week. Danny has such skill and expertise, a true artist at his trade. Absolutely the best haircut ever!! Easy to get there too, right off the freeway directly across from Anthem Outlets! Thanks Danny!
5	Best haircut I ever got.  Great service, and from now on I'll be their customer.Danny did great job, really impressed.Place is nice and clean, enjoyable, and I recommended this place to anyone.  They know their stuff.
5	Danny and this shop rock. Had a deluxe cut and shave today, best I've had since I was in Manhattan last time. Danny knows what he is doing, this was a three hot towel shave and a great cut - none of the short cut thinning shears here like they do a "V's". This is all business, nice jazz going on in the background and a great value for the price; $40 without tip. If you don't try this place you're missing out.Bill, their new number client
5	Great service and very friendly. Always offers my kids candy even if they aren't getting good haircuts. Really nice place. Fair prices for the quality.
5	This review update is in response to the most recent derogatory review left by a fellow yelper. I have been frequenting this establishment now for well almost a year, and have always been treated with respect, and have been provided with A+ service each and every time I'm their.   I am by no means related to/am friends with the owner. What she does do however is provide a wonderfully attentive haircut , and shave at an extremely reasonable rate. I will continue my patronage without a doubt.
5	Always a quality haircut and would recommend to anybody.  Prices are reasonable.  The atmosphere is nice.  They even do a great job on kids.  I've looked all over for a place that has consistent quality without costing a lot and now I've found it.
4	So far, so good. it feels like I'm back in NYC in here. The styles are similiar and the staff are attentive and skilled. They have my business.
4	I went here once because I got a coupon in the mail. It was a fine experience and if I recall I got a beard trim only. It was a fast, very modern and clean.
5	Great local shop. Offers a shave if you want a treat and they don't look at you like the moon.  Clean and friendly.
5	Nothing better than walking into a barber shop with great energy and perfect customer service!!! But that's not it!! Walking out of the best barbershop with the perfect cut is no better feeling can't go wrong, hands down best place to get a hair cut!!!! Thanks Larisa and the two gents!!!  1-10 **10**
