4	This place is so freaking huge!!!  You know how some book stores need to serve Coffee to make you stay longer?  This music store has a cafe because you'll be there so long you may need sustenance!  I'm always going to prefer a locally owned spot, but if you're looking for a massive all-you-can-eat-buffet of movies and music - this is your place.A section for just about everything.  They have CD's, DVD'd and VHS tapes of all types - music, movie, bio, concert footage - you name it.  A healthy section of listening sections for new material.  Great selections of box sets.  They even have some of the fun pop-stuff to go with these things.  Harry Potter lunch box.  Hello Kitty notebook.  James Bond martini set.  The Faint t-shirts.  That kind of thing.  Best part is - they almost always have sales.  Tons of stuff for 9.99 - which means it's hard to walk through the place without picking up at least one thing.  And if you're in the mood to do some serious shopping, the cafe has a seat with your name on it.
