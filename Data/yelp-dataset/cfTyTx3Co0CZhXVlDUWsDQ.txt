1	Horrible! I was trying to find a specific item, so I waited in line for 10 min for someone to call for help, then 5 more min for this guy to show up and ignore me completely and help someone else. When he was finally done, he didn't listen to a word I said and unsurprisingly wasn't at all helpful.
5	The folks at this store are great. Always helpful and know you by name if you come in often enough. There are usually special items lining the aisles which are awesome deals. Great rewards program. They also have one cool novelty: old hard to find sodas like Cheerwine and old fashioned cream sodas, both on ice and in cases to go. Free popcorn and hot dogs on the weekends sometimes!
5	I want to give these guys 5 stars because they have great customer service and advise for home needs.  I come into this store a few times a month and any question I present has an answer.  The store itself is always clean and very friendly.  I get the mail letter with the deals that go on and they are great.  I think overall the pricing here is good and much better than home depot or lowes.
5	Wonderful and very helpful staff.  Once I walk in, I am greeted by the cashiers, as I walk down the main aisle, I usually don't more then 20 feet without someone offering to help me find something.  Wonderful people, fair prices, friendly store.  I buy anything I can there instead of the huge stores.
5	I just love the folks at Karsten's.  They are always eager to assist, they have a great selection and I would prefer shopping there over the larger stores.  Although my "fitbit" would prefer I walk around aimlessly in a larger store, if you want a great selection and regularly great prices, Ace is the place.
