1	Came here while a robbery was in progress.The cops asked me why on earth I would have come here alone (at 9pm, no less)Avoid at all costs, unless you need more excitement in your life.
1	This place is disgusting. The floors are an abomination and the staff is weird; even for a CVS. There's one guy who looks like Gallagher in drag. Weird. The constant presence of crackheads and street whores in the parking lot makes getting back to your car an adventure.
