4	I'm sure I'm not the only homeowner that bought a house and then was like, wait.. where's the key to the sprinkler system. I had no clue what kind I had as the cover had been painted and had no clue where to even begin. Thank goodness my realtor at Twins & Co. recommended Sprinkler World. I walked in one afternoon with photos of the painted cover and a thought from my realtor as to what the brand was (which I quickly half forgot of course). I walk in, feeling like a complete idiot as I tell my story and say the name of the manufacturer wrong multiple times (and don't realize it until I'm corrected by a play-laughing staff member on my way out).I got a few keys to make sure I never lose them again... they were the right ones the first time.. and they're super cheap. Total win!!! And they've gained my trust!!
5	This place is great! They are really trust worthy. They loaned us a sprinkler controller while they fixed ours for a good price. I really Like them and would recommend!
4	Go here one time, & you will never again visit Home Depot for anything sprinkler-system related.  Very knowledgeable, great prices, easy to do business with.
5	Always great service. As an amateur, sprinkler world has helped me with parts and supplies for two back yards. They have everything you need here at a reasonable price.
