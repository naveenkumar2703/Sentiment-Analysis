5	The two Glacier Water vending machines at Bell Fuel & Food, on the corner of Cave Creek and Bell Roads, have the cheapest price in town (according to Derek, the service technician who inspects 150 machines in north Phoenix). Only 15 cents a gallon, as of summer, 2010.As an added bonus, pull up to any Glacier machine while the technician is servicing it and it's the company's policy to give customers free water -- even if you've got four or five 5-gallon jugs in your trunk! Thanks, Derek!
3	Although they don't filter out all of the contaminants, they filter out enough for me, especially considering the price! WARNING: check the "Last Serviced" date which will scroll by or display on the machine you're using. I've had to call the company about three of their machines which showed they hadn't been serviced in months.
3	water is tastes good. Although my wife for some reason is adding baking soda to the gallon jugs. I don't know why? Regardless, I have paid between 20-25 cents per bottle. The only issue I have with them is that they dont have a location service on their website. You would think they would have a mobile version location service.  We have gone to a few areas and the water vending machine was not working. When you go to their web site, you have to either call or email them. However, their phones are not answered 24 hours. So, we waste trips when they are out of water somewhere.
5	I have been patronizing this water store for a couple of years, now. I have tried Many different water stores around the Phoenix area and None have as good tasting water as this store does. The woman that owns and operates the store bought it a couple years ago. She is super nice and helpful! I had moved further away a year ago but still make the long drive to fill my bottles up there because the water tastes so clean and good!
