5	Mike was crazy helpful! Easiest rental experience ever!!! So much better than enterprise! Thanks for getting us back on the road quickly!!After a horrible experience trying to get a rental car from enterprise I called my bank which recommended this Hertz.  They were the most helpful car rental experience I have ever had! Not only did they give us a great car, but they picked us up in a super timely fashion.  We ended up needing the car for a few extra days and they were super accommodating.  When I dropped off the car they even offered to drive me home and drop me off! This experience has single handedly made Hertz my new car rental to go...overall fantstic customer serivce.  If you're staying IVO Nellis AFB I would recommed this car rental location to everyone!
1	While this location is convenient, I will NEVER use it again.  My fault, left my ipad in the rental.  My husband immediately went to retrieve it and was told it was never in the car (ONLY place it could've been.)  Yesterday I was contacted by someone who bought it on Craigslist.  I have nothing but contempt for dishonest business.
1	Worst rental car business ever. Waited 10 minutes while one guy helped a customer (there was several people waiting ahead of me) did not end up getting a rental from here. I will be calling the insurance company to see of different location to get a vehicle
