5	Walked right in. Bethel listened to me to understand exactly what I wanted and gave me a terrific haircut! Thanks Bethel!
1	Horrible place..took one of my kids there to get her hair cut, didnt even need a lot cut off...they botched her head completely! And to top it off, when I complained, they justified the cut and did not offer any compensation, they offered a 20% discount on my "next visit"...you really think I would go back after that?? I do not recommend this place to anyone for anything. They obviously have 12 year old's handing out degree's, this place is awful!
1	Going to try and add a photo... gave my 12 year old the worst haircut of her life. She starts 7th grade in a few weeks and we were in a panic to get it fixed after they butchered it! Fortunately, Serenity Hair Design was able to fix it but it's a LOT shorter than she wanted it because Smart Style jacked it up so bad.Took her back in and their solution was to offer me a 20% off coupon for "next time".Got ahold of corporate and they agreed to give me a refund, but the fact that we had to go through this was terrible.PLEASE do not take your kids to Smart Style to get their hair cut!!
