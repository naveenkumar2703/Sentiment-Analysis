5	Dr. Nash has been my Chiropractor for over 10 years. She doesn't believe in covering over pain but healing indefinitely. She's also a nutritionist and has a great weight loss testimony. Her staff is fun and they work with people to make them feel better.
1	I went to this place in extreme pain.  Dr. Nash took x-rays and told me that my spine was severely crooked and that I was in Phase 2 degeneration.  She told me that I needed THIRTY treatments or I might be looking at surgery.  I told her that I had been told that I had 6 lumbar veterbrae and she looked at the xray and counted "1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  Nope you have 5 like you're supposed to"  She refused to treat me that day unless I committed to the 30 treatments, and sent me home in pain.  Well, I don't respond well to scare tactics, so I ran far and fast from this place.I found a wonderful doctor in Las Vegas.  He took x-rays and the first thing he said was "Have you ever been told you have a 6th lumbar disk?  It's called a transitional disk"  I liked him right away.  He also said that my spine looked really good and that I had hardly any degeneration.  I told him that Dr. Nash said I had Phase 2 and he said, "not even close!"I guess people buy into her crap because she's in business, but I found someone who had me back at work and feeling great in TWO treatments!
1	Disappointing. I first went here for an auto accident and I signed a form for cash payment. My insurance wasn't billed. For 3 months of treatment I was billed over $3000!!! I asked for a discount and fought to get 20%. My hubby then went & Dr Nash herself negotiates all pricing. She only charged him $350! And billed our insurance who also paid per visit. None of my EOBs seem correct & I know Ive overpaid!!Never will Dr Nash get my referrals again.
