1	I am so angry at this dry cleaners!  I have been using this particular dry cleaner for over a year.  My husband is an entertainer and so we have many of his articles of clothing drycleaned.  And I mean many!They are rude, yes, but I really did not care as long as I could get my clothes cleaned at a reasonable price.  But after going to them on a weekly basis for over a year they lose the slacks to my husband's Italian Suit.  I count the pieces and everything looks good until I get home and the pin stripe pants that they have with my husband's jacket do not match!  NOT HIS PANTS.  I take it back and show them, I give them the pants, i give them 2 months to find his pants... no avail.  I take in the receipt for the $650.00 suit and am told they will give me no more than $200.00 and they do not want my business anymore!  I intend to go to small claims court over this one.DO NOT GO TO THESE GUYS!!!!!
2	They're close to my house, and they're fairly cheap. They do a decent job, and they usually get stuff done as promised. But as the mike c said, the lady behind the counter is a little gruff. She always seems like someone peed in her cheerios, kicked her cat, and insulted her mamma right before you walk in.I've compared her to the soup Nazi from Seinfeld, but she has yet to tell anyone "no dry cleaning for you" yet.It is cheaper if you prepay, but there and they will get the job done, but there are other places to take your clothes, and they will at least pretend to be happy to press your pants and launder your shirts.
1	The tiny lady/girl behind the counter will surely put this cleaner out of business, sooner or later.  Have been going there since they opened for the last few years.  But i have had enough of the tiny terror behind the counter.  What is worse, is she is the only one there who speaks English, he boss, the owner, does not.
