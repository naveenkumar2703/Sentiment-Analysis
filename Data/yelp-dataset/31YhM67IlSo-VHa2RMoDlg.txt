5	Probably the best pedicure I've had in Glendale. Super fast, and a great price. The place was clean, the staff was very nice, and they did a fantastic job. Plus, since two of us came in and got pedicures at the same time they gave us a voucher to come back. The gel nail polish is $22 or $20 M-W, which is a great price. Would definitely come back again and recommend to anyone in the area!
4	Good prices, specials and coupons.Defiantly will be returning

I ended up trying here simply because either was near my home and it is amazing! Frankie always does a great job on my acrylics, and the price and quality of their pedicures are unbeatable. The only reason I rated 4 stars is because they always seem to have only one nail tech so if he is busy you are stuck waiting. But it's worth it!
