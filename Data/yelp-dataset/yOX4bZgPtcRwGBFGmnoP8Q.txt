5	Why expose a child to music at such an early age when there's so much time? If you've ever been around young children, you've probably noticed how they tend to try to skip rather than walk, dance rather than stroll...Music together in Phoenix creates the perfect environment for you and your little one to harness the opportunity to grow with music. The undeniable benefits are endless whether it's neurological stimulation and brain growth, or fine and gross motor from dancing and playing with the instruments or vocal and speech development from singing! That doesn't even mention all the fun you will have dancing, snuggling and singing! We will be starting our 3 semester with Music Together in Phoenix and my little 14 month old loves it! Teacher Sarah & Teacher Kathy are spectacular!
5	My 2 year old LOVES the music classes with teacher Sarah at the Kids.Play.Music location (32nd/Shea).  It's a fun, interactive class for both caregivers and children.  Get ready to sing-a-long and make music!
4	My toddler is a huge fan of the classes at Music Together and so am I!We go to the 32nd and Shea location for Sarah's class and look forward to it every Friday.  My nanny usually takes him to class, but whenever I get the chance to go, I join as well.  The class is fun and interactive and teaches the kids socialization, music, dancing, singing, playing with instruments, and more.  Sarah is awesome at what she does and a pleasure to watch in action as well.  The smiles on the kids faces during the class says it all... If you're looking for a fun weekly class to stimulate your child, don't hesitate to look into Music Together - they've got several Valley locations.
5	Our daughter has such fun with teacher Sarah on Saturday mornings! We have now completed two seasons of Music Together with our 13 month old and have really enjoyed this wonderful, enriching family experience. Children are never too young to begin appreciating music and this is the best place to start!
5	Music Together is great! The songs are really great and fun to sing, so much better than "kids music." My kids both sing the songs at home from a young age. They love to jam with all the instruments in class. They also like pretending to sleep during the lullabies. Music together is a wonderful program for early music exposure!
