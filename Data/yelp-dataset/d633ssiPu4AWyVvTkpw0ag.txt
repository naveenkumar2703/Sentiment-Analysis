4	i really like this light rail stop. it's really cool. Yelp!
5	As far as cities go, Phoenix is a baby.Well, this baby is growing up- and learning to walk and run. Now that we have a light rail system, it is easier, cleaner, and more fun to get around. Does it go everywhere we need? Nope, not yet, but every system starts somewhere.The light rail is very clean and safe, thanks in part to the CCTV security system, and the proactive enforcement that PPD does. If you've ridden the bus, and gotten that creeper vibe, fear not- the light rail does have any of that. With plenty of seats, bike racks and ADA accessible seating, this will get you where you need to be in style.The Roosevelt Station is great. In addition to plenty of seating and shade, there is a really cool light show setup, and at night the station looks more like a night club, then a place to catch a ride. If only it were named Fhoenix Area Rapid Transit (FART), it would be amazing. Maybe next time.
3	This is the metro rail stop for those interested in visiting the roosevelt arts district. I've walked the stretch from here to the hi metcalf hostel when i've been in town. The place has new art galleries popping up and what look like small nightclub venues. Also quite a few wall murals dot the buildings on this stretch
