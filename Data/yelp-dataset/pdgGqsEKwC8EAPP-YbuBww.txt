5	Stealth Denny's    -         These 5 stars are Denny's 5 stars.  This is as good as a Denny's restaurant gets.  Plus the Flying J (recently bought by Pilot) has a bright, sparkly tower of Swarovski and fine Chinese blown glass and crystal Objet  d'hearts right at the Denny's entry.This Denny's is huge, tall, well-lit, nicely decorated and seems brand new.  Because it serves truckers and travelers, right cooking, all dishes all the time, and good service have been well-taught.  If you can ignore the baconalia and cheese-a-thon items, the menu has newer, healthier items added.  We've had complicating life issues for 18 months keeping us out late most  nights.  Denny's is always 24/7, the menu is dependable and affordable.  We know Phoenix 24/7 eateries.  One other bonus about this roaad-travelers Denny's - that rancid flat -panel webcast perfectly named "The Bite"  does not run here.  Never forget, a Flying J has fuel plus more items in stock than you'll ever imagine you'll need.  This one, being a metro stop is toned down.
3	The parking here blows. And is now getting worse with the instalation of the LNG station in the parking lot. The denny's is one of the best I have been to.
3	Probably one of the cheapest places to get petrol in town.  If I'm in need of fueling The Tank and I'm on my mom's side of town....I stop by here.
