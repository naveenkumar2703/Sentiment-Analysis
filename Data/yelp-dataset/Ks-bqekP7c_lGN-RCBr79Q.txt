3	Staying at the nearby Mandalay Bay, the better half and I were looking for something that wouldn't break the bank.  So what could be better than a little taste of home.  No, its not a buffet, no it has no fancy nightlife, and no it has no flashy theme.  It's just an inexpensive "just what you expect" Little Caesar's tucked away inside the Luxor.If Little Caeser's is what you are looking for, its exactly what you'll get.
2	My friend was super excited to get some crazy bread - she kept talking about it since we left Portland.  So I headed over to the Luxor food court from Mandalay for them.  The bread sticks were a little tough and needed more parmesan cheese.  Luckily, we got the dipping sauce to soften it up.
1	Is this my first bad review? Oh no. I was hoping that throughout my entire Yelp Career that I wouldn't experience a place I haven't liked. But the time has come my friends and it has hit like a hurricane.I came here after a long day of studying. All I wanted some crazy bread. I had a coupon that said I could get them for $1.99 and I went there with the intention. I walked in, it look moderately busy. It was a Saturday night and weekends are usually the prime time for pizza consumption. I didn't even want pizza. I walked in and I wasn't greeted with a smile. As a matter of fact, I was greeted at all. I stood there while the cashier was just standing around. I finally built the confidence to say hello. I let out a nice sounding "hello," well I think it was nice. The cashier was uninterested and basically asked me what I would like to order like it was a burden. I felt the awkwardness and told her my order, she obliged and took my payment with so much enthusiasm, that is sarcasm by the way. She basically threw my crazy bread and sauce into the bag and handed me it without even giving me much eye contact. I left without a word and moved on.At least the crazy bread was good.But that's it.
