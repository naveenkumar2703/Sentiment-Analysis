4	Ok, this place is authentic, very well priced, and damn good!When I worked for the power comany we used to hit this spot up when we were on the east side of town. Good steak & shrimp burittos, street style tacos.I sometimes take my out-of-town white friends here to let them see a side of Vegas most tourists wouldn't see being so far away from the strip. :)
5	Wonderful salsa bar and authentic Guadalajara food.. so happy we stopped here. You must try a birria taco with the pineapple salsa
4	The food here is  great.  Has good flavor and reminds me of my grandmas cooking.  Customer service was also good, the lady at the counter was friendly and patient while we looked at the menu and decided what we wanted.  I ordered the gordita and taco combo and everything tasted great.  My husband ordered the enchilada and taco combo.  He said this was very good.  I also ordered a champurrado and I must say that it was the best I had ever had.  The taco was good, but I have had better.  If I'm looking to only have tacos, I already have another place for that.  Since the food was so good here I know I will be returning to try other dishes.  The only thing I did not like was the way the food was served on styrofoam containers cut in half.  It just looked a little ghetto to me, and that's why they got 4 stars from me.  Also, for all the food we got and drinks, our total was $16! You can't beat that, every time I go out to dinner with my husband our total tends to be around $22.00
5	Great food! Best shrimp burrito I've ever had. Get the nachos, you won't be disappointed! 10x better than Roberto's!
5	It's a dive, but the food is world class. There is nothing comparable in the area, though there are many restaurants that serve similar cuisine.
4	Good authentic good and friendly staff. And they have a library of books in Spanish. Excellent.
