4	Near Bacon Street (Yes, there is a Bacon Street!) in Waunakee, this is the gas station we always use to fill up on our way to and from Sauk City. It's clean and you can buy cheap bananas here.
4	Convenience store royalty (how's that for an oxymoron)Yelping my way through the only Waunakee in the World, I'd be remiss if I didn't review the Taj Mahal of local convenience stores, Kwik Trip #832.Things I like: * Cheap bananas, potatoes and onions at 38 cents per pound. * A nice (though rather pricey) selection of groceries, so if I need something after the local grocery store closes, I can usually find it here * It is one of two RedBox locations in town * The store is clean and well lit * The always have multiple registers open, so I rarely wait in line for more than a minute * The cashiers are generally friendly * While not my first choice in coffee, they keep their coffee fresh * The kids are a fan of the slushies * They are open 24 / 7They often have daily specials on pizza, burgers, hot dogs, etc., but I find the quality of these items near inedible.
4	Nice breakfast sandwiches such as ham, cheese, egg english muffins and a 16 oz coffee for $3 and some change.  $1 bbq pork sandwiches (I don't want to know what's in the meat at this time ... ignorance is bliss).  I like that the employees are always friendly, and this might be related to the fact that it's an employee owned cooperative.  And you can always count on a seldom played 80s and 90s song playing on the loudspeakers while you're pumping your gas.  Their car washes are also really good and efficient.  And we stop here for milk on the go sometimes.  Fast and easy for my Sun Prairie existence.I'm docking them a star because unless you've been living under a rock, styrofoam cups are kind of not cool.  Switch to paper cups for hot beverages and I'll revisit the rating.
