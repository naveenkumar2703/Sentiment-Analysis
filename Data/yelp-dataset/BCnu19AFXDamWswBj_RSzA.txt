5	I am on vacation in Arizona and after 2 weeks of frustration trying to repair an electric window myself, I finally made some calls and found AUTO VAUN to be the friendliest of any service shop - and that was just over the phone. When I dropped off my car this morning I was not only met with a smile, but a genuine concern for my problem. I was kept up-to-date on the progress throughout the day and this afternoon when I picked up my car it was absolutely one of the best experiences I have ever had at any auto repair facility. Vaun is a great guy and really made me happy with great service at a fair price. I will recommend AUTO VAUN to anyone that expects more than the usual just-enough-to-get-it-done mechanics that are so prevalent these days.
1	If I could give them a zero I would!  My car left their shop basically the same as when I took it to them - not starting. Got it home and it simply would not start.  I called them the next day and I have yet to hear back from the owner. Very disappointing!  All I wanted was an apology and the $50 diagnostic fee refunded.  They charged me for a battery, diagnostic fee and a belt $430. Not sure that is a fair price for the experience?
