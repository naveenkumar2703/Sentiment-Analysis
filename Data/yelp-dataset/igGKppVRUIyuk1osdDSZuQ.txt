2	The name is fitting because that's what practically covered the joint. This place was empty when I visited. I got tumbleweed stuck in my hair. We had to invent people to talk too!Not the staff's fault, they seemed very nice. Just not a popular place anymore.
4	Back in the day, The Spider's Web was the place to be seen for a particular type of Edinburgh gentleman. It's typical punter was permanently on disability benefit, had a severe alcohol problem, and would often spend 12 hours a day in here, drinkling heavily and soiling himself, in order to escape from his battleaxe of a wife. In turn, she'd spend most of her days chain smoking and having unprotected, disesase ridden sex with various men she met down the Jobcentre.It also had a cult following amongst nightclub revellers whom were just a bit too keen to stay up all night and damage their internal organs further. Sadly, both customer bases seem a bit thin on the ground  these days, but fingers crossed it can ride out the storm and return to glories past.
4	Not the coolest of places... but my goodness! are the pints of 80/ here so good!Also the Beatles memorabilia are pretty impressive.  Friendly too.Save me having to trek down to Diggers for a damn good pint.
