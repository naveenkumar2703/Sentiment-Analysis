3	It's almost a surprise to find somewhere as unassuming and normal as the Coffee Mill on the West Port, which seems to be a hub for kitsch and quirky businesses.  Among the strip joints and second-hand bookshops, it's reassuring to know that there's somewhere nearby that just sells straightforward coffee and sandwiches.Half of this shop is dedicated to take-away, half to sit-in tables.  It's always been quiet when I've been, making it an ideal spot to retire for a read of any recently purchased books.  The staff are always smily and friendly, almost to the point of excess, and there's something especially delicious about the coffee they sell. The food they do is basic - baked potatoes, filled rolls etc. - but makes a perfectly satisfying lunch.All in all, there's not much more to say about the Coffee Mill.  There's nothing remarkable about it, but that's ok, some things don't need to be remarkable.

We had coffees and a couple of paninis with salad, both of which were fresh, tasty and clearly carefully made (which is saying something, paninis are ubiquitous these days and often tasteless and slapped together). Really nice snack, we'll definitely be back when we're in the area.

This place was perfect. The owner Gino was extremely hospitable and accommodating and the food was delicious with extremely reasonable prices. I highly recommend this place if you are visiting on a tight budget or if you just want good food with great service at a good price.
