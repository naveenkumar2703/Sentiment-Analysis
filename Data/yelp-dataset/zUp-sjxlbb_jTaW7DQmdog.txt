5	Great service.Friendly staff.Pricy, but uses plant extracts, environmentally friendly, has no sulfate or paraffin, not tested on animals.Gentle ingredients that don't irritate my sensitive skin.Their unique graphic design and location appeal to me.My fav is the Mango Evasion because of its scent and creative design.I also like their repairing hand butters (not hand cremes), it really works.
5	this is a wonderful store if you're looking for the unusual gift for that someone who has everything. the staff is super friendly and always willing to assist. I highly recommend this wonderful little boutique!
4	I knew there was something going on.  I got an e-mail from this store saying they were having a 70% off sale.  Before Xmas???  I decided to check what was going on.  Of course, I was late.  There was only shower gels left.  Not a big fan of their shower gels, however, their Cucina products are awesome. The dish soap sets are so nice.  Thank goodness I have a stock in my pantry.  They are closing the only two stores they have in the USA.  I guess we can still shop online, however, I like instant satisfaction.  Too bad, I will miss them.
5	unfortunately this great little boutique in keirland commons closed : (the good news is you can still order online.
