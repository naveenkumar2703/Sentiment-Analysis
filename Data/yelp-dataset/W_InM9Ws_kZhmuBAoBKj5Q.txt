4	Took my son a haircut today. He's been going to another Sports Clip near Paradise Valley and really enjoys it.  He's 7yrs old. Jessica was great with him. His favorite part was the shampoo after the cut and then a shoulder massage to finish off.
5	They cut men's hair and my friend got a really nice cut.  I asked if they could trim my bangs and they were really accommodating. If you want a fast, quality haircut thIs is the place to come!
5	Awesome I love this place!! Been going for over 2 years now and have yet to get a bad haircut. They are fast and have your style written down so you don't have to explain each time.
