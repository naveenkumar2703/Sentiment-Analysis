4	Torn between a three star and four star review.  The three star side is the washers are old. There are 4 extra large washers in the back.  It's $1.50 for the regular washers, and $3 for the large ones.  The dryers are 25 cents for 9 minutes. The reason for the 4 star review is the guy who owns the place is often in the laundromat, saying hi to the customers and making sure every thing is running great.  They used to have an awesome wall art installation, but it was recently taken down.  Hopefully he'll do something equally neat.
5	Kind of a sketchy area and older machines (similar to the ones I had my old apartment complexes in Berkeley), but I give this place 5 stars.1.  Soap, bleach, and detergent dispenser ($0.50) each 2.  Change machine3.  Regular washers for $1.50 a load4.  Oversize washers for $3.00 a load5. Convenience store right next door if you are hungry or thirsty6. Huge dryers $0.25 for 9 minutes7. THIS PLACE HAS WIFI!!!And the wifi is way faster than my stupid AT&T Uverse internet at home.
4	Let's face it, laundromats are creepy, and no one wants to be there. Especially when you're a female there alone and a scary guy with a staring problem comes in just to hang out, not to do laundry.Anyway, other than that guy, who finally left, this place is pretty ok. They have Maytag machines, which is always a plus. The wash cycles aren't as long as with some other places' machines, so I missed putting Downy in the rinse cycle, but my clothes came out really clean. All of the washers and dryers are kind of old, but there were no problems with them. Cleanliness I would give a grade of C, but I always have Lysol with me anyway as part of my laundromat supplies, so it wasn't a big deal.There was soft rock music piped in, not too loud, and no annoying blaring TV, so that was nice, too. It's not a fancy place, but it works for me.
3	I was looking for a wash and Fold service, they do not offer this.   The rating is not valid, for my review, I did not use them.
