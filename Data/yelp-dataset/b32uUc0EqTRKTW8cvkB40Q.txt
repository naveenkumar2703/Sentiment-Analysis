5	Opening less than a year ago, I had no idea this beautiful center was located in South Phoenix (Broadway and 16th St) I went to see a black history month presentation in their gorgeous performing arts center. What a lovely venue! I assume they use the space for worship too. I do hope that the center will be used for more performance art, especially for youth theater.
4	Really cool things for kids and family to do. If you live in this neighborhood then you already now this. The rock wall and giant pool place are definitely the main attractions, but there is also a game room, gym, boxing ring, and gym equipment. Definitely worth checking out even if it's a little out of the way.
5	This place is amaze-balls!!! Seriously all those years at The YMCA and I could of been coming to this mini resort! Love LOVE it! Sadly I think they only have this location but seriously worth the drive for those non-members that don't live near by, 2$ for a day pass... That's a deal!!!
