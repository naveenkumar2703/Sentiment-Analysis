2	I had a $5 coupon in the mail so I was like what the heck. And is it next to Home Goods (one of my favie home decoration stores). I got to the store it is like a Famous Footwear with an auction going on. Most of the shoes are off brands and made cheaply. Then loudly over the speakers, they announce the specials for the moment. Felt like I was at the fair. I rather go to DSW if I am going to shop discount shoes.
3	This place has decent deals for shoes and we bought two pairs of name brand Nike / New Balance running shoes that were nice for 100 even after the coupon and deal. Yes they have a guy running around with a microphone and it was packed full of people, but nothing odd or out of line. This place is a good stop if you don't want to pay full price like at sports authority and just need shoes. Not bad, not out of this world. A-okay!
1	We've been in a few times, service is usually subpar at best.Stock is iffy, your best bet is to stay out front and check the sales. If nothing good then head out.
