5	No one does it better then Kevin at Help My Swing.  I was referred here by a co-worker of mine and boy am I grateful.  Kevin has a true knack for people and knowledge of the game of golf.  He's a true gentlemen who actually cares to help whatever it is that you need.  I had my clubs bent and fitted for my swing...since then I've had crisper ball striking and more confidence from tee to green.  A+ here Kevin, thank you sincerely.5/5-Doug S.
3	I went there last year for a few weeks to get some lessons. Kevin seems to be a good instructor. I like his method of teaching you how to swing the club. I have only played a few times after my lessons, but I was swinging the club much better then I was prior to my lessons. I would definitely recommend this place for golf lessons.
5	Kevin is awesome!  I've been looking for someone to help my game for years and I have finally found the best.
5	After going through various golf instructors my daughter has finally found someone that connects with her and is really breaking down the concept of a good swing.  Kevin has cut strokes off her game and she is improving each time we meet.  Thank you Kevin your system does work.
