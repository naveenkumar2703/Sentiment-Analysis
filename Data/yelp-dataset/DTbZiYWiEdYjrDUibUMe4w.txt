5	My Overview- I went there with my boyfriends for a couple of drinks before we actually went out for the night. Not really sure what to expect, we were very surprised to see how cool and "ultra" it was , from the out side it reminds me of a basic everyday hotel but stepping inside its like walking into a hip vegas hotel. As I spend a lot of time at The W in Scottsdale , it reminded me of a sister to it! So we checked out the place , nice furniture , patio with fire, whoo hooo! BE sure to order the Bubbletini ! We had such a good time we ended up staying the whole night! Awesome times!Hidden fun  that I hope people discover!
5	I love this place! Like Jessica said, you don't expect much from the outside, but once you step in, its a complete 180. I live across the parking lot at the Grigio, so going here to pre-game before going out is a great option. I would have no problem staying all night, but they usually close by 12AM. They'll stay open later, but only if it's busy enough.
4	Great spot to stop in for some drinks as we live next door. Bartenders are always nice and the atmosphere is pretty laid back.
2	This place is a wreck. No cocktail toothpicks? Just go ahead and dump some of those nasty olives in the martini glass... Red Zin stored in the refrigerator...Bartenders looking up recipes for staple cocktails...If you're going to ask crazy high hotel prices, maybe you can offer service to back it up?
