Man If i have one quilty junk food plesure it is a chedder cheese pretzel wraped hot dog with nacho cheese sause and a large lemonade. You can bet money if I am in the mall this is a must. For get the Starbucks or the Cinabon this is it. To all you pretzel heads out their enjoy!!!!
5	I had the Pretzel Dog, the dog tasted really good and juicy,  Auntie Aunt's Lemonade is better tho.
4	Great place to grab a snack while shopping. Their pretzels are warm and soft on the inside and slightly crisp on the outside. Just like I like my soft pretzels!
