4	Cleaner than any other QT I have ever been to. Very well stocked. Pleasant experience each time.
4	I have been to this Quick Trip several times over the past 8 years. It's easy to get in and out of and normally there is always a few spots open to pump my gas. It's also conveniently located. I can stop here on my way to work and still be on time. I don't usually go inside, but the inside is nice (for a gas station!) and easy to navigate. Overall, I really like this Quick Trip and would rather to go any Quick Trip than a different gas station around the valley.
3	This QT is just a short distance from the 51 Freeway and is a great spot to grab some gas if needed and all your snacks and drink needs.  Very busy location so be careful driving in and out.
4	I always prefer to stop at QT's. It's just a lot more comfortable. They all look the same and are always well maintained. Bathrooms are very clean. Floorplans are very similar. My preferred place to stop for gas or random snacks during the day.
2	The male bathroom was very dirty. There were crap stains on the back toilet and urine on the floor and foot prints in it. They are not keeping the bathrooms cleans at this QT
