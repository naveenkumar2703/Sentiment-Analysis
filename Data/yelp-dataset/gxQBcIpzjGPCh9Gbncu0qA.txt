4	I really like this place.  Both indoor and outdoor seating, the food is pretty good.  You can get items pretty topical to New Orleans/Cajun style, and haven't had a thing there I haven't enjoyed.  The prices are not expensive.  Nice place for a casual time.  The one problem is that sometimes the service can be slow...
5	I used to love this place and was sad it closed.  I spent many hours at the bar, watching tv, chatting with the crew, and munching some wonderful cajun eats.  It was a gas around the turn of the millenium and, as I said earlier, I was sad to hear of it's decline followed by it's ultimate failure.
