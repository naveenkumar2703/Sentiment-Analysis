5	Jackqueline is the best hairdresser ever!!!!!!!.   She transformed me from Blonde to a redhead, which is not an easy task.  I love my color!  She is absolutely fantastic with highlights and a true artistic with color.  You will never be disappointed walking out of the salon!
5	I've been getting hair extensions for a long time, and had some horrible experiences. Thankfully I found Jackie & I have never loved my extensions more. They look & feel great! Not to mention she is so funny and sweet which makes sitting for hours at the salon go by so much faster :) everybody says they know what they are doing, but when it comes to hair- I completely trust Jackie, she's the best in Vegas!
5	When I moved from Chicago, I was scared to find a new extensionist. I had gotten 3 sets of Hairdreams that looked good but kept falling out - I figured it was just my hair, but Jackie put in a set of Great Lengths that look GREAT, feel much better, and best of all - they're staying in!!! She figured out what the problem was and fixed it, took my old extensions out, colored my hair, and put the new ones in all in one day. And for a better price than I was paying before. Jackie is great, highly recommended! Plus, as another review said, she is funny and sweet and down to earth, which makes the 7 hours in the chair go by a lot faster!
