5	My wife and I have hired Chris the Cake Lady on countless occasions including for our wedding and my wife's bridal shower.  Hiring a baker is not something we do every day, so to be honest, we didn't know what to expect from our first consultation with Chris.  To our surprise and relief, Chris is exceptionally knowledgeable in her craft, and was able to help us design exactly what we had envisioned.  Thanks to her, we had two amazing cakes that far exceeded our expectations.I would, and do, recommend Chris to everyone looking for a professional, creative cake designer.
4	Don't buy another cake or cupcake from the grocery store!  Once you try one of The Cake Lady's you will be forever spoiled and will understand what I mean. You will wonder what it was you were actually eating in those store-bought cakes and cupcakes.  While you're ordering one of her delicious treats, why not ask her to make you some of her incredible cookies.  She does that well, too.  She is a tad expensive, but I promise you it will be worth it.  Feel free to thank me later by sending me a dozen of her chocolate chip cookies!
1	My mom order a cake for my sons 2 nd birthday. The decoration was impressive. The cake was disgusting. I was embarrassed and was so grateful I had made a ton of cupcakes because there was no way I could serve that cake to the guest. When my mom wrote "the cake lady" to tell her the cake was actually awful she never even replied with an apology for the less than appetizing product she delivered. I would never recommend this lady, terrible service. If your considering getting a cake here don't do it! Find someone else.
