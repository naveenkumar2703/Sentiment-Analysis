5	I have been seeing Michelle for over 1 year to 'save face' sometimes once per week and other times once a month!  Her work is impeccable, as each time I leave her office, my face feels complete.  She is about 10 miles away from me, yet it is worth the drive!  Michelle is conscientious, knowledgeable, and loving.  She cares for me personally as a client and as a dear friend.  I would send any one of my clients to see her for any kind of aesthetic work they require!  I do hope she never moves out of the state, I just may have to follow!
5	I am a person who really enjoys spa treatments, so when I say this is the best facial around, I mean it. I have mild rosacea, and because I was taking a medication, it got WAY worse. I had acne on my cheeks and neck, which is not a problem I had ever had. You won't believe this, so I hope you are sitting down....Michelle gave me a facial and an LED light treatment and my skin was almost completely healed the next day. I had been trying to clear this up on my own for about a month.  It was unbelievable. If you have rosacea, sensitive skin, or acne, you have to try this.  The reports about how nice Michelle is are correct. She does a really good job of massaging you while masks dry, etc. She is very attentive and service-oriented. For example, she  is always rubbing hands, arms, or feet in addition to your face. The table is very comfortable, sheets are high-quality and smell very spa-like with nice music in the background. Not only will your face look good, but it's a very enjoyable experience. I would go every day if I could. I highly recommend this place. Two thumbs up for sure.
