5	Pizza was perfect and ready before I was.
4	= = = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =Enjoyed trying this fairly large Peter Piper for the first time today, near the 11 AM opening time.  Things started with friendly Priscilla taking my payment and my order for a custom pizza of thin crust, red sauce, Mozarella, Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, mushrooms & olives.  Then it was over to help myself to some of their 3 tossed salads:  Garden Ranch, Classic Caesar and this month's special, Mandarin Cranberry.  All were fresh & good.Before long my custom pizza was up, but uh oh...  I forgot to ask for Bell Pepper on it along with everything else.     :-|Ok, no problem, it was delicious as made.  Also, they have shakers of red chile flakes to add on and there were also other pizzas out with various kinds of peppers on them, & I enjoyed a couple of slices...  ok, a few slices of them.     :-)Priscilla stopped by my table to make sure everything was good.  Of course it was; this largest Buffet chain in the Valley runs like a clock!  Along with that, the Weekday Lunch Buffet is only $5.99.     :-))
