5	I needed to tint my windows since the desert summer is on it's way. I asked my brother, who has been living here for a long time, if he knew any place that was reputable or if he knew any one that could recommend a place. A co-worker of his, who is very picky about who works on his vehicle, recommended this place. So I decided to trust him and I was very happy with the work done. First of all, the technician is very friendly and he has a friendly dog too. :) He showed me the different shades of tinting he had and asked me to pick the ones I wanted. He also recommends shades if you're not too sure. He put a tint on the top of my windshield as well with out me having to ask him. He warranties his job for the lifetime of the vehicle. I am definitely recommending him. I have a four door Toyota Corolla and it cost me $149 in March 2010. While I waited, he put in a movie to keep my occupied and help the time to pass. It took approximately two hours.  Please check him out if you need tinting done! :)
5	I ended up finding out about this place from one of the sales people at subaru of las vegas. After reading some of the reviews on city search and other places I decided to give him a call. I made my appointment and on the day headed down. It's easy to get to but a little hard to find you can not see it from the street. Joe  ( the guy who runs the place ) is awesome.  I hung around and watched while he did the job. He never said I was in the way and didn't mind all my questions.  We spent the whole two hours talking. It was like hanging out with an old friend you have not seen jn a while. He did an amazing job for the right price. And from now on when my friends and family need tint this is who I am recommending.
5	Joe does PERFECT work. I used to watch him when he came in to our shop to tint windows, He takes his time and always does the best work out there. I am one of the pickiest people around and believe me when I say that Joe is really that good at what he does! No dirt under the film, clean precise cuts, always cleans up his work area & your car when he's finished!
5	Joe has tinted 2 cars and 2 trucks for my family. Great job! Great Price! He backs up his work. I would not go anywhere else.
5	Had 2 of my cars tinted here and I'm very satisfied with with the quality and work!  I've tinted at many other places throughout the years and this is by far the best experience as far as craftsmanship, integrity, and service.
5	Joe was able to get me in at the last minute to tint the front 2 windows on my SUV. Great price for fast and flawless work-thank you :) Will come back to get the rest of the truck done!
5	Amazing work. Great guy. Love my new tint!
5	Its really hard to trust people when working with your car. They either upscale you or try to sell you things that you dont need. Joe was true and honest with his price. His work is worth the money spent. As with other reviews on here I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND DC Window Tint for your cars tinting needs. Thanks again Joe.
5	Joe found a $20 in my floor board while tinting my windows and returned it..this guy is def a good person, and did a great job on my tint as well.
5	I found Joe on Yelp! I'm glad I did my research and found him. He is a one man show. So it helps keep the price low. The quality of service, product, and installation was incredible. My car looks great! I can't wait to refer him out and use him again.
5	After reading the reviews I called DC to see if they had anything Open for me to get my expedition windows tinted  today ( Just the front two windows) Joe mentioned that he was working on a car but he didn't have to finish it until tomorrow and if I come right away he will fit me in. Wow! Made it there in less than 10 minutes he pulled the vehicle out that he was working on And pulled mine in.  He called Me back in about an hour and a half after working on my car and it looks great. Customer service, dependability And quality of work Joe is your man.... Highly recommend.
5	Joe is the man. He does awesome work, never skimps on details. When I bought my new car it had no tint on it what so ever so I did my research and decided to call joe @ desert customs. His prices are great, for the quality of work he does I would expect to pay atleast double. Will refer all of my friends no doubt!
5	Found this place on Yelp while looking for a window tint shop close to my office.  He got good reviews and lived up to them completely.  I had him tint just the front two windows of a new car - price was fair at about $70 and the work looks flawless.  There isn't a speck of dust under the tint and the cut lines are very clean.  His shop is a little hard to find and you need an appointment but I highly recommend.
5	Joe was great!! We were scheduled on a Sunday to have just the 2 front windows tinted...but decided we wanted the whole car done.  Instead of rescheduling he said he could do it all that same day!! It turned out awesome!! He did a great job and the SUV looks good!! I would recommend him to anyone:-)
5	Went to Joe's to have some tinting work done on my Honda Civic. Joe is a one man band and does everything HIMSELF surprisingly; so don't be shocked if he's booked a month in advance.  He is very professional and is an honest guy. He def. knows what he's doing. While waiting for him to install the tint on my windows, he let me pick from a vast array of movies to watch and made me feel like home which made time go by so quickly. When he had finished, my car looked amazing with the work he put in. It was very professionally done for a good price compared to other places. I would highly recommend his shop for all your tinting needs. Thank you again Joe!
5	**Summary**       - Price - $150 for four side windows and the rear window. You can't beat that.       - Area - The shop is in a garage on a less than reputable area, but if you go during the day, you should be fine.       - Appointments - I'd make an appointment if I were you. We came in on a Saturday and the guy was booked solid for the day. We left it for a day and he graciously did it by the next day though.       - Quality - The tint looks good and he puts real detail into his work.       - Trustworthy - You get a real sense of honor from the guy when you talk with him.**Recommendations**       - If you're looking for tinting, here's your guy. Cheap and good. Need I say more.
5	Got four windows and the rear glass done for a great price.  Great service and you can tell Joe really puts meticulous care into what he does.  I recommend him to anyone wanting to get tint done on any vehicle.  He's also a genuinely nice guy who will go out of his way to make sure you get what you want and are taken care of.
5	Just had my tint done by Joe.  I got front & sides done completely, and strip on the windshield.I called around before I decided on him, and his prices beat most of the other shops.In the end I decided on him because of the other positive Yelp reviews.He has an ugly, beat-up shop in a low-rent neighborhood.  But that doesn't stop him from doing amazing work.He's a great guy to boot.  I chatted him up while I watched him apply the film, and he just comes off as a great, working class guy.Just a warning that he's a one-man shop, and very popular.  So be prepared to wait for an appointment.In my opinion, Joe is worth the wait.
5	I think it's a very very very rare feat to achieve 5 stars on all reviews here on yelp and Desert Custom Tinting lives up to its reputation. According to previous reviews regarding his schedule being booked for several weeks in advance, I must have been lucky since I got an appointment the very next day!  It isn't in some fancy looking plaza center but don't let that fool you. The owner Joe is very professional and his shop is very clean. Although he went above the estimated quoted time, he did a fantastic job on the tint. I would trade extra time for quality work rather than a quick sloppy job any day. Joe, communicates very well. Easy and friendly to talk to. I would definitely bring back my other vehicles again. 5 stars for Desert Customs window tinting!
5	Joe  ( Desert Custom Window Tinting) is a true professional and gentleman, and his service is unbelievable and awesome! I found his shop on Yelp, after reading the reviews, I thought it was too good to be true, but after going over to his shop and making an appointment, then having him tint the front windows on our Dodge Caravan (BTW~ a perfect match to the rear factory privacy glass, as promised!), he deserves 5 stars, hands down. Joe puts the customer and the quality of his work at the top of the list. He goes beyond and does the little extra (without asking!) to satisfy the customer. Plain & Simple, if you want window tinting done to the highest standards with the upmost quality, at a very fair price, make an appointment with Joe @ Desert Custom!
5	I've been a customer of Desert Custom Window Tint for the past seven years and Joe has always done an outstanding job on all my vehicles.  I find him to be an honest and highly skilled professional who is always meticulous about his work and careful with the treatment of the vehicles on which he works on.  I have never had any issues with the tint he has installed on my vehicles and his guarantee on workmanship is something that I find valuable in his services.  Desert Custom Window Tint offers high quality services for a very reasonable price and I highly recommend them for those looking for tint services.
5	Joe did a great job on my gfs civic. You gotta call ahead because he does get busy. He hooked it up too and really pays attention to detail.
5	Joe treats every car like it is his own.  He has done both of my cars and a truly professional job.  He is NOT in china town. He is on valley view just north of the Gold Coast casino. (On the same side of VV as the Gold Coast). I walked to Starbucks for a bit.
5	Same as the other reviews... Joe is a very professional and seemingly honest guy.He worked on our SUV (all sides and rear) , and so far, the tint looks very nice. I am going back there next month for him to work on the vehicle's front windshield.
5	Joe is AWESOME.  This young man is the best.  Very knowledgeable and expertise.  The reason I went to Desert Custom is after reading the wonderful reviews, I definitely knew where to go.  I enjoyed this young man and is a wonderful person.Thanks JoeCharlene :)
5	Took my 1992 Toyota MR2 in for new tint on my Drivers, passengers and two small windows for only 100. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is in need of new tint.
1	I normally do not leave posts unless service is really good or really bad.. This place is REALLY BAD!! They tinted my brand new Mercedes and a hack job is an understatement. I searched Yelp and saw they had 5 stars as did their competitor Eco tint. They were less expensive (not by much) so decided to go for it. All went fine until after I picked up my car around dusk. I look at it in detail next day in day light and see the tint was cut short around edges in qtr windows and back windows. Instead of replacing the piece, they used what looks like a wet sharpie blk paint pen and conveniently "filled" in the short comings. When asked about it was told that I didn't say anything about it when I picked up and they do not take responsibility. I was not remotely in the mood to argue. All I said is you burnt a bridge and hung up. So if you want a shop whom conveniently hides things likes this, could care less about customer service and customer retention skip this hack shop. I'm kicking myself in the head for not using their competitor Eco tint. Based on their reviews, if they did make a mistake they would at least have the decency to fix the issue and make a customer happy... Shame on you Desert Window Tinting!!!
5	Awesome!! Great Price!! Great Work!! Loved working with the owner Joe. I'm from out of town and needed my daughter's car done. He totally took care of her, did a fantastic job and I never felt I had to be there protecting her interests. One point is you need to make an appointment (no big deal unless you are in a hurry) but it's worth the wait. Thanks again Joe for a great job and taking care of my girl!!
5	Took my jetta to joe and couldn't have asked for anything better! Honest, and did a phenomenal job!! I highly recommend him, he won't disappoint for the great price.
5	I called trying to find a place to tint my wife's car, Joe got me in that day and was the quickest and most efficient tint job I've seen on any of my vehicles. Can't beat the price and service of Joes shop.
5	Owner went out of his way to get our car in to get it done. He gave us an estimated time of completion and had the professionalism to call and let us know he needed 30 more minutes. The job was done well and we are very happy with the results. We would go back if we needed another tint job.
5	I took my 96 honda civic to Joe and was extremely pleased with the end result.  DEFINITELY WORTH THE WAIT! (I had to make an appointment 6 weeks out).  The price was very reasonable for his high level of quality work. I definitely recommend!
5	This dude was awesome!! Did my tints perfect. Been 2 years now and is still in great condition.  Great quality for great price! I always recommend this place to my friends and family
5	After some research I found this place and decided to call, glad I did, Joe is a proper professional and prices his work fairly.most importantly I made an appt for a week out on my only day off and he had my time open when I arrived. try that with your doctor here.... will be sending my friends his way, thanks Joe
5	Had a hard time finding the place, but once I did it was an awesome experience.  He has movies you can watch while he works on your car. He is super friendly and the tint looks amazing.. would recommend over any corporate ran place any day of the week
