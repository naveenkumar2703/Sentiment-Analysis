5	My wife's brand new car, got plowed into by a snowbird.  Very Pissed. State Farm gave me several options for body shops they recommend.   I called KK in Mesa and spoke with John Schira.   He was very friendly over the phone and after our call, I decided to bring our car to them.Not only was it finished in 2 days, they took car of arranging the rental car and you honestly can not see any of the damage caused.  Really great work.
1	Went to this location for a auto body repair estimate. Was told when I got there to sign a form authorizing them to do the work. I refused, however, was told by Ruth and Bernie that it was only to have on hand if I had chose Kustom Koachworks to do the repairs and they could order the parts. That sounded ok.  Called my insurance regarding the repair and was told that Kustom had actually faxed them the form(within 24 hours) for payment. Advised the insurance company to stop payment as this was a scam. The general manager of Kustom Koachworks called me within and hour & listened to my issue and apologized on behalf of Kustom and that is the only reason that I gave them 1 star.
5	I will bring my car here from now on -- so honest, so professional, so good at what they do. I have nothing but praise for this place, especially for John, the general manager. They are the best!!! You won't be disappointed!!!
