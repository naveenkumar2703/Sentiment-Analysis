3	A sentimental favorite, not only for the chicken ranch sandwich (crispy breaded chicken breast w/tangy wing sauce, cool Ranch dressing, lettuce & tomato), but also because at 16, I met my first Pinoy boyfriend here (he was the busboy).It didn't last, obviously, but I'll always look back on that moment fondly. You know, before he dumped me on my birthday and asked for his jacket back.
