3	I just had my annual MOT for the 40+ here. To be really honest this place is due for an upgrade. The building is tired and the interior features questionable. It is also a maze. The big waiting area is very open and consultation rooms are dotted around the waiting area. Different rooms for different functions. a talk/examine room, a weighing room, x-ray room.. etc. I guess it serves its purpose. Staff is very efficient and the nurses are friendly and to the point. They have been supplied with ipads and laptops that look a little out of place in the tired setting. I was in and out in 30min.
