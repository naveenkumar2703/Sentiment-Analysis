4	Carl's Jr is may favorite fast food burger, it has a good grill flavor not like BK which to me taste like liquid smoke.  They have a hearty low carb burger that taste great and fills me up.      They also have interesting featured burgers . The staff brings the food to you when dining in and clears your tray when your done , they always check to see if everything alright.
4	Growing up in San Diego in the 1970's meant Mickey D's, Jacks, BK, KY Fry, DW, and if I was good, Carl's Jr.  A Super Star with Cheese, Criss-Cut Fries and a drink was a treat.It still is.  With all the choices in fast food burgers, Carl's is still one of the chains at the top of my list.  As a matter of fact, I think it sounds good for dinner tonight on my way to DeMolay.
3	Just finished the 2 for $4.00 Famous Star special. The hamburgers were average, with a nice grilled flavor. The Spicy Chicken sandwich is also average. Generally, I find that Carl's Jr is expensive so look for coupons.
2	.The prices are high, the restaurant is constantly dirty. The food vs price value is poor and getting worse. Want good value for your dollar, go to Del Taco down the street.
