5	I spotted this place on a bike ride & decided to try it out:) I didn't look up what time they opened & showed up about half hour before they opened up:) The owner noticed me & my friend outside & opened early! We couldn't decide on a pizza to share so we each ordered a baby extra small:) The ingredients were fresh & bountiful. I hope this hole in the wall stays a Litchfield Park Staple.
5	I am not sure where this place is, since a buddy just dragged me here.  I am from Denver.  Anyway, this is great pizza.  We had a X Large sausage, peppers and onions and a large plain.  Cut in squares (apparently Chicago style).  According to my friend they fly in all the ingredients from the Windy City and also have great sandwiches.  If you live in the area, this is a good hole in the wall and you should frequent.  Or at least, give it a shot.
3	Its definatly a hole in the wall kind of place but food is yummy but it is a  BYOB kind of place
4	Ordered a medium Deno's Special and 20 BBQ wings, both were fantastic. Decided to take them home (A/C must have been out) the place is very small only four tables, very sparsely decorated and sterile.  Incredible place for takeout! The food is great and with some table cloths, candlelight, and vino (no alcohol, so BYOB) this place could be that amazing hidden treasures you talk about for years.
5	Best pizza in the West Valley.  As good as Chicago pizza
5	Great pizza!! Chicago style!! Good thin crust Good cut in squares like back home good sauce and cheese. Best pizza in the west valley!! Small hole in the wall, no AC in there I think, had to call and ask where the hell it was, I passed it 3 times but was dark out lol I drove from near PIR race track and was well worth it!! It was great and will go here few times a month I bet! A must try and not to far from sox spring training for Chicagoans to get some descent pizza!
