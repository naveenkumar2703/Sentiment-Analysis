1	Not a real business. He's never there when I go during his published hours. One day he took the whole day off without posting a sign on his door or updating his voice message. (He doesn't have a web site that he could update with his ever-changing hours.). Stopped by twice today and he wasn't there. The other fellow doesn't speak English.I'm not wasting any more time on this guy. Not a serious, credible business.
5	Really great job done on my car with a good price to boot. I recommend this place for your car audio needs for sure. Tony, the guy who runs the place, really takes care of you as a customer. I have gone here twice already and couldn't be more pleased with the service!
1	They want money upfront ,the owner very rude. I went to stero city (480-835-1466 ) they charge me $150 to install my alarm. That is half of what other charge. And they  did a-1 job.
1	DO NOT USE PRO AUDIO!!! We had an appt for a window tint. Tony was thirty minutes late which was bad enough. But we him saw pull into the shop parking lot, thought that he was gonna park backwards, then realized he wasnt parking he was driving away. This is absolutely ridiculous!!! DO NOT USE PRO AUDIO!!! DO NOT REFER PRO AUDIO!!!
