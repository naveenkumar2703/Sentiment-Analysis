4	As far as city centre convenience supermarkets go (of which I'm starting to prove myself somewhat of a specialist...) this here is the Daddy. Big enough to stock practically everything you could need on short notice but small enough not to include all the junk that would clutter up the store otherwise; this Tesco is perfect for those living close by who need to pick up drink/pizza/cigarettes on short notice without wanting to pay the usual "convenience tax" for doing so, as it's one of the few places nearby that won't charge you for the privilege of shopping there..This Tesco Express should be made first port of call for anyone living equidistant or less from this one and the one over in Tolcross - that is unless of course Farmfoods has whatever you need in stock...
4	This Tesco Express is my local store, so I shop here a lot. The staff are very friendly and always greet me. Like the previous reviewer said, it has a ATM, and is larger than the store on Lothian Road, with more products and slightly cheaper prices  however, it is an express, so often doesn't have some of the ingredients you might need to make your meal. It is handily located at the start of the union canal  perfect for grabbing something for a picnic before a stroll along the canal towpath!
