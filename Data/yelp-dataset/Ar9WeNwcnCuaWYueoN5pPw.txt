1	I placed an order two months ago.  They took my money and I never heard from them.  Have tried e-mailing - no response,  Tried calling - phone disconnected.  They must have gone out of business right around the time they took my order,  Website still up and running but I advise not placing any orders with them. Gave them one star because I had to put somethingOk a few hours after posting the above review, I received two emails that the canvas was unavailable and they were refunding my money. Does not explain not responding to my follow up emails or disconnected telephone #.   That's all I know about this store. They said they called me several times but calls do not show on my phone .
