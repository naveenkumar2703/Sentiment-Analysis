5	I enjoy visiting this store on my lunch break.  The staff is very friendly, and they have a great selection of greeting cards and gifts.
3	Visited this shop today and am questioning whether I'll go again. The store is clean and organized but the staff does not like children! Every time I enter the store with my three year old or baby in stroller, the front desk person peers around the corner every few minutes to see if we are shoplifting. We have given them no need to be suspicious and it's very uncomfortable. It's a shame because I live right behind the store and like to support my local businesses within walking distance.
1	I wasn't there to shop in Sue's Hallmark, I went to use the Post Office that was located in the shop.... This was my first and only visit. I will NEVER use that post office again! I have never encountered such rude, unprofessional staff. This one lady in particular had absolutely no customer services skills and was beyond rude to me. I'm sorry if you hate your job but I spent a lot of money to mail Christmas presents to my family and since I couldn't be treated with respect you will not see my business again. Also, be prepared if you go there they don't take credit or debit cards, but they do take checks and cash. Who seriously even writes checks anymore?! I only gave this place one star only because I had to.
