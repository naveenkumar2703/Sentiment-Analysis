5	The staff at the front desk is so attentive to everyone there that they have no problem dropping everything to help people out in the gym. Safety is a pretty high priority when you have people hanging 30 feet in the air. Here's your chance to lighten up! Practice your breathing and go to your happy place. I've gone to Yoga all over the entire valley. I've had good Yoga experiences, and I've had BAD, so I know what I'm talking about. I LOVE Yoga on the Rocks so much that I go to 20-30 sessions there every month! The staff is amazingly friendly and helpful and are quick to know you by name. Every single Yoga instructor is masterful and has added so much to my Yoga practice. You'd be hard-pressed to find a Yoga studio that offers so many classes with so much diversity every day. There is always a great class going. I know I'm not perfect, and I've always found everyone there to be very friendly. I hope I'm able to continue my Yoga practice at Yoga on the Rocks forever!
5	I've been attending restorative yoga classes with Janet on Wednesday nights for about 4 months now. Her classes are inspiring, informative, and fun. My back pain from scoliosis has improved greatly and I have energy once again. Thanks to Janet for helping me feel so much better and changing my life.Sue MorrisonScottdale
5	The staff is very friendly and very accommodating - the customer always comes first at this place. I realize that is the standard, but it is actually very hard to come by organizations that put their customers first these days. I usually attend Kandi Neal's classes - she is awesome. Her class is very easy-going and she is always willing to modify her sequences to cater to her students' preferences/needs/restrictions.
