2	Well the office staff was very nice.  The pool is gorg  - but the heater was "broken".  Somehow I dont believe that.  I was shown an apartment that is in the right price range. The only problem is that nothing is updated.  The kitchen and bathrooms are easily from the 80's.  There is also only 1 pool there with super uncomfortable chairs around it.  For the price they charge-  you can find updated apartments somewhere else.
3	These are nice apartments. however like previous review the need to upgrade their appliances. also they require you to have renters insurance. the location is great!
4	I really enjoyed living at Bellagio Apartments - in fact, I would still be there now had my job not transferred me to Pennsylvania.  The apartments are all very large in size, and the community is quiet and has a lot of well-maintained green space.  The staff that works in the office are very friendly and any maintenance issue I'd encountered was quickly resolved.  The location in Scottsdale was close to the 101 and 51, as well as Scottsdale Road shops and restaurants.The appliances in the kitchen could have used an upgrade, but everything worked just fine, so i was happy on that front.  The Washer and Dryer in my unit were brand new.
