4	Everything I need for an improptu Carne Asada party - carne, pollo, tortillas and delicious guacamole! Throw in some Bimbo pastries and Coke and I feel like I am in San Carlos!
4	Excellent carniceria in Peoria. I agree with other reviews, this is the most northern carniceria to where I live and I love it. Been here about 6 times ordering the carne asada and have never had a bad experience. Every time I cook the carne I get compliments and questions where I buy it. Great place!
5	Best carniceria in peoria. You cant beat the price for a full tray of cooked carne asada meat.  Love going here and buying lunch for work for everyone. Insde theres lots of cooked and uncooked meat to chose from
