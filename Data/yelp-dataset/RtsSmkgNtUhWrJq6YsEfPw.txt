4	Hubby and I just got in from seeing this show tonight, I definitely underestimated this show! It was HILARIOUS! I love hypnosis shows and watching people do stupid things. The first 5-10 mins was kind of a drag and long and made me wonder when the hypnosis and fun stuff is gonna start, and once it did, I couldn't stop laughing til the very end. Rated it as a 4-star because the hotel they're playing at sucks, and there weren't that many people there tonight. I'd say there was about 25 ppl there or so. It still wasn't bad. My favorite part: They gave one guy a rubber penis, made him play with "himself" then wander around the audience and they made random girls tug on his fake penis, then "took his penis away."  Just the look of confusion, horror and desperation for his penis was so hilarious.  He ran through the audience over and over in pure confusion and horrified that his penis is gone, then he asked every single person in the audience if they've seen his penis, or if they knew where it was. Good god, I died laughing. I wish this show was on the strip in a more popular theatre so it can actually get recognition and get more audience to make it even better. I'd see it again for sure. If it was at a better hotel, and more audience... i'd give it a 5 star.
