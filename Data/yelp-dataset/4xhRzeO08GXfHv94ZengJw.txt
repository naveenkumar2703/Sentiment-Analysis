4	In a pinch I love Hi Health.. when you forget to order protein shake or metabolism boosters online, this is good in a pinch. Also buy one get one half off is always a real draw for me but you have to have one of their stupidity cards (those lame little plastic p.o.s. that go on your key chain) to get that deal. However online you'll save that and some from other nutrition e-tailers. Stores are decent enough and usually have a hottie or 2 working there.. I love it when they have to bend over to grab something off of a lower shelf.. makes the pinch even better!
3	Small store but informative staff.
4	I will go out of my way to go to this Hi Health location because the employees are so knowledgeable and friendly. Some people who work in retail/sales act inconvenienced when asked questions or for help, but not at this store. I have been having knee issues for a while and the sales girl was very helpful in finding me the right product for my problems, while being conscious of my wallet.On another instance I was in the market for some diet pills and the sales girl recommended I also take vitamin C supplements so the diet pills would remain effective until the end of the bottle. I appreciated her suggestion and found the pills to be very effective. Thumbs up, Hi Health!
2	They raise their prices  a lot at a time, you can get better buy's on vitamins else where.
