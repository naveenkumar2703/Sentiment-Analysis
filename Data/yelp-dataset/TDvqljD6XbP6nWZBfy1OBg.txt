2	It's Subway.... what do you want?
3	Its Subway. Thats about all their is to say about this place. I will say it is a very clean well run store and the owner takes pride in this location.
4	This location makes good Sandwiches.  I of course order my regular Sandwich which is a footlong BMT on Cheesy Italian Bread.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mLj1xf3Za6PAoEYsddOOOQ?select=1yN8r6CM5fMLgf_nI8OJ2wThe Sandwich Artists here pay attention to your order and it generally goes smooth.  Plenty of seating inside, which is always a bonus for me because I enjoy eating at the restaurant.  My experience at this place is always a good one.Return Factor - 90%
3	Not the worst subway experience.  Not the best.
