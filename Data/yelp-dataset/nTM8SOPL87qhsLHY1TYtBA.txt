5	Dr. Bui has been my personal physician for several years. As a patient, I know I can rely on Dr. Bui to be there when I need him. He is always attentive and caring to my needs. Highly recommended.
5	I just started to see Dr. Bui and he is the best Dr. I have ever had! He makes sure that all my questions are answered and is very thorough with everything. He makes sure that I am taken care of and is genuinely concerned. Most doctors ask what you are there for and then treat and leave the room. he asks if you have any questions and will answer them !!
