4	My regular place had too many customers in line. Their fault for having only one cutter working. So I came here. Two cutters. I was in the chair within 10 minutes. Friendly staff.Good conversation during the cut.The cut came out great and she made it like I like it.
5	I am so pleased with this place! It has a relaxed easy atmosphere. I went in for a haircut because my hair was messy and dorky looking. I guess I didn't communicate well enough because the cut came out different from what I expected. Oh well, my mistake. I admit it. I went home and my hair was really uncomfortable because some of it was falling in my face. It just didn't look right either. So, I got out the scissors and butchered it. Yep. Messed it up big time.I went back to Great clips a couple of days later and told them what I did. They were able to straighten it all up and cut it the way I really wanted. Very nice job! As I was getting out my credit card to pay for it, I was told, "No. There's no charge". Wow! I was fully prepared to pay again because it was my mistake. They got a new repeat customer!
5	In my opinion, the best affordable hair salon for men in the area.They ALWAYS get it right. On the rare occasion that I try to get a haircut elsewhere, I am quickly reminded why I should stick with Great Clips.Service is fantastic and with the online check in now things are much better. I used Tony a few times and always get compliments.
5	Absolutely perfect service every time I come in. Staff is friendly and always cut my hair the way I want. I've been using great clips for a while and I've always had great service. This location is not super busy, so wait times are not long.
1	Place is terrible. One person signs in online and brings a whole family so I can wait over an hour. I will never go to this junk hole of a place ever again.
