5	Best coffee, they always have special flavors for each season! Right now Pumpkin Spice & Cinnamon Cookie are my favs!
5	Clean store, can't beat that. Most convenient stores are not. The staff is friendly. I have been coming here for over 2 years and love that all the employees know me by now.
5	Great store  good employees. Even when there is a line it still goes by fast. Not like other 7-11 that have a line inside and one employee is outside smoking. Great place
