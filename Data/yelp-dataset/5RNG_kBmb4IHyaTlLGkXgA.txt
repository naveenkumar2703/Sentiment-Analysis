5	Hourly rehearsal rooms.  Fully back lined with gear.  $15 to $25 an hour is pretty cheap.  Especially if you jam with 3 or more people, the cost is nothing when it's split up.  No cops, no drama, and a clean fuckin bathroom!Love this place!
5	This is the best hourly studio in Las Vegas.The parking lot features clean ash trays and a picnic table.There are 5 rooms ranging in size and price.All types of bands practice here and everyone is pretty cool.Earplugs, snacks and water are available in the office.Sometimes I go to MDV just to have a quite place to cry to myself.You can call far in advance or the same day to book your time.HAVE FUN!!
