5	Great service, and delicious food!I had the croissant with ham & cheese, which, to my surprise, came served in a full dish with salad on the side, like a regular lunch course. For dessert I tried their chocolatiest treat: Chocolate ganache cake. Delicious and SO chocolatey!! My boyfriend had the waffle with nutella and I have to admit I stole about half of it. delicious waffle!!! At the end, I went upstairs for the bathroom, and saw that the best seats are actually on the top floor! With a bird's eye view on the Royal mile, you can people watch from just about any comfy seat (it's armchairs-only upstairs!!) thanks to well-placed mirrors. Lovely!!
