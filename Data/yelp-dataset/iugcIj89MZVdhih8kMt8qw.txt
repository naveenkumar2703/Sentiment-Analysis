2	With a name like Smoothie King, I was hoping to find smoothie worthy of a crown! What I got was a mediocre blend of frozen yogurt, a fruity syrup, and protein powder. I didn't care for it, and the stryfoam cup it came in is disappointing to my environmentalistic side. The store definitely had the chain, mass-produced feeling. However, there was quite an extensive menu, so, for a smoothie lover like me, I suppose this joint is worth more than one shot.
4	We really like some of their smoothies.   They can be very flavorful and they are always well made.   We focus more on the few that don't have banana in them.We feel they are fairly priced but some may find them more expensive than they would like.
5	Good selection service.   They have products for weight gain, weight loss energy boost, as well as pre and post workout. I step in here regularly after working out at anytime fitness.  Call ahead and have it waiting for you when you get there!
4	Good variety of delicious smoothies!Tip:  You can order your smoothie "skinny" which means they don't add sweetener. According to the nutrition guide, this saves you 100 calories and 24 grams of sugar.
4	They make smoothies.  Can a smoothie ever be bad?
