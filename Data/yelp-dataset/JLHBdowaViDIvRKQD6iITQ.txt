3	Drive through was quick. Food is the same as any other King.
2	Not sure where that hair on the seat came from, but given its curly nature I'm a bit worried.  Yuck.  And I noticed this halfway through my meal.  Many tables/seats not cleaned here.  Food took longer than usual.  Bleh.
3	I've been to this Burger King several times for lunch and dinner, mostly because it's the closest one to my house. Today I went for lunch, and the food was better than normal for this location. Many times I've gone in the past I've gotten food that seems to have been sitting out for most of the day. The workers today we're also friendly. Wait time in the drive thru was also quicker than normal. If my experience every time was like my experience today, this would probably have been a 4-star rating. Whoever was on staff today, keep up the good work.
