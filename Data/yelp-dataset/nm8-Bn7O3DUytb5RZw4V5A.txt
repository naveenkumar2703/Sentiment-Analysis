1	The employees at this location are the losers in life who never finished college because they were too busy trying to figure out when they were going to get stoned again next.  Now they are out in the working world and things haven't changed much.  Except, instead of talking during lecture about the next great party, they are doing it behind the registers at this Culver's.
4	As part my introduction to Wisconsin culture, I had my first taste of fried cheese curd. They were hot out of the fryer, not too greasy and delicious. Staff were welcoming and helpful, dining area clean and comfortable. If I had more time during my visit, I would've returned to try more of their menu - i.e. burgers, sandwiches, salads, and frozen custard sundaes. Wish there were a Culver's closer to San Francisco.
3	The butter burger was definitely better than the ones from McDonald's but not up to Five Guys's quality.  Prices are a bit higher than BK or McD's but they do have fried cheese curds, which were hot and delicious, and much better than tater or cheesy tots.  I also had an Oreo shake, which was very rich and creamy.  We need a Culver's on the East Coast.  Just be warned that drive-thru service can be pretty slow, at least at this location.
5	Better than most fast food joints.Clean dining room with free WiFi.What more to ask for?
2	Walked in 10 minutes to close and was told by the manager that they were closing soon and that they needed to kick everyone out then. He said "you can order food if you want, but you won't be able to eat it here." Thanks, we won't eat there. Congrats on getting out of there on time.
5	Really great restaurant!  The friendly staff took the order quickly. The beverage selection was impressive. The whole restaurant was very clean. The staff member Yvonne was so helpful with placing an ice cream order, and she was so nice! Great job, Yvonne!
