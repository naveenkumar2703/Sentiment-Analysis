4	Hidden away on Lame Mendota is a little place called Cafe on the Pier at the bottom of the Edgewater hotel. This is a cocktail bar and restaurant on a pier over the water- does not seem like you are in Madison when you visit the PierVery neat place - great drink menu with a lot of unique cocktail options. The drinks are kind of pricey, but the location definitely is worth it. Great place to grab a drink in the one or two months of summer in Madison.
2	While I'm still sitting on the deck at the Edgewater Pier I felt it best to review immediately while my feelings are fresh. Drinks, including beer, are very overpriced- food is also overpriced and bland. Service is slow.  The only perk is the view, but if you have a boat you're better off packing your own drinks, grabbing some McDs and dining on the lake!
3	I ordered the fish sandwich (hovers between $8 and $9) and my hubby ordered a bbq chicken sandwich. There was a nice guitar singer sololist. Wait staff was attentive and friendly. It was a gorgeous day, low 80s around sunset, so this really had a nice impact on my first time here. No complaints!   A hidden gem, for sure.
