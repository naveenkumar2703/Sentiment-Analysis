5	I love this place!  The  3 employees I talked to are all friendly and helpful. Because I have a vintage Travel Trailer I originally approached the older parts guy  in hopes he might have some parts for my old trailer. Most of the items were no longer made, but on the most important-the propane hose / pipe setup, he was able to sell me the current model and the appropriate adapters to safely make it work. As  I delved into the trailer more, I kept returning for other items and in many cases got something that I could adapt. (old trailers are hard to get original parts for!). They even sell tires and rims here! And rain drip rails for over the doors and windows.I have returned a few times, and will come back for more. Check out their sale areas--they even have some hitches and trailer truck  mirrors on clearance!
5	If this place doesn't have it, you probably can't buy it...  Staff is always friendly, selection is overwhelming (especially for a fairly small space) and prices are reasonable.   This is really the only place I go when I need parts for my RV (other than WalMart for TP and tank chemicals...)
4	Love this place. From the outside it looks closed and when you walk in it looks like they need some paint and ceiling tiles replaced. But the customer service is great! As soon as I walked in I was approached and was asked if I needed any assistance. The staff is very knowledgeable, friendly and very helpful with parts and repairs. I was there for cam locks, keys, propane, sewer treatment, and a replacement door latch. They had some reasonable priced led light bulbs and wood burning products. They also have a great selection of items. Only downfall is there key machine isn't working and neither was the Propane station. Refill on propane is $3.50 lb. not bad. Call if you need to get keys or propane. But I will be back. :)
