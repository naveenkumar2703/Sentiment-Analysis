4	Travis is very nice and helpful
1	Average services. The doctor i met wasn't that helpful & courteous. He was always in a hurry. Never spent more than 2 minutes with me in any of the visits. He felt irritated by the normal questions i asked. He didn't give a clear enough idea about my condition. I had to virtually dig information from him.I don't feel confident enough about the treatment i've received here.Won't recommend this place to anyone.
5	Dr. Salyer was my doctor and he was great!  He took the time to explain why I was having shoulder problems.  I had x-rays and the x-ray techs were nice and friendly.  I had two cortisone injections and it fixed me right up.  I would recommend Dr. Salyer for anyone looking for a good orthopedic doctor.
