1	The sandwich maker tried to pull a fast one on me by covering the scoop used the measure the chicken and give me way less than half a scoop. When I called him out on it he  laughed and said that's how they are made... I went ahead and had him make 5 total sandwiches with double meat, double guacamole, double bacon, extra cheese, all toasted, filled with veggies and lots of sauce... when it was time to pay I laughed and said that's how it should be made and walked out. Negative 5 stars
3	Well it's Subway. What else do you expect. Nothing real good and nothing real bad. To be honest I try to stay away from Subway ever since I heard about the chemicals they use in their bread being same as yoga mats..but my options were very limited this night in downtown Glendale. So we came here. We didn't notice that they close at 9pm and we walked in at 8:58. No ill will from the 2 employes working and they were happy to make our sandwiches. So 3 stars. On a side note the area can be "lively" in the historic area of Glendale, so enjoy the people watching.lol.
3	I think the previous one star rating was unfair. This is a typical Subway with the same consistent sub sandwiches as any other Subway. The staff was friendly even though I walked in two minutes before closing time. The food was fresh and delicious and I have no complaints.The facilities were very clean and well maintain to include the bathroom.This Subway is located in historic downtown Glendale, which provides some interesting people watching inside and outside the restaurant. There was nothing great or bad about this Subway.
