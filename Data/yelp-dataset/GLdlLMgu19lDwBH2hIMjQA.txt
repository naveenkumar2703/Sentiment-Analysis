5	If you're looking for a great place to find great home furnishings at a great price, then Estate Resale is the store.  They get new items coming in daily so I usually stop in several times a week to check out the new stuff.  The prices are fantastic!  I have on occasion sold a few items on consignment there as well.  This is by far the best consignment shop I have been to in the metropolitan phoenix (sun city) area.  If you love home furnishings, you must stop in.
5	Over the last 10 years, I have been slowly furnishing a vacation house with great finds from Estate Resale at 99th & Bell--sofas, arm chairs, lamps, framed prints, china cabinets, sets of dishes, you name it.  Prices are very reasonable and quality is top notch.  Delivery can start at $50, but if you think you can borrow or rent a truck and do the job yourself, they will help you get your items to the door of the store.  (By the way, the previous comment about a bad BBB rating was based on ONE complaint in the last 3 years--and NONE in the prior 12 months).  The store now has a second location at Bell & Cotton in Surprise and it's also filled with great items.
2	Sun city high prices. No public restroom. Nothing special about the place. Staff is friendly but nothing more than any other business. Just your average sun city used furniture.
4	This is a well organized shop that is clean and easy to access. It has a very nice assortment of collectibles in cases towards the back. Larger furniture pieces are in the front of the store and seemed to be priced higher than thrift stores or estate sales but obviously less than new. While the styles weren't trendy, there were good quality items. Will keep this shop bookmarked and on my "route".
