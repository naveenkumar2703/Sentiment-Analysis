5	I had occasion to avail myself of Greta Muirhead's legal services in a real estate matter in NV.  She was thorough and handled the transaction promptly and professionally.  She has a solid grasp of the law. Her fees were quite reasonable.  No one likes to deal with lawyers but this was a fairly painless interaction.
5	I hired Greta to represent me in my custody battle and I have to say I will do so again in any legal matters. The matter was quick and painless due to Greta's knowledge and we walked away with all that we had asked for.
5	Greta was wonderful at helping me to sort out some key issues regarding my mom's estate and what my obligations were.  She got back to me quickly and was very forthright and super helpful.  Easy to talk with, great personality.  I highly recommend her.  Thanks Greta!
5	I have to say that Greta was AWESOME in getting some very time sensitive legal issues dealt with quicker than i could have imagined - Clear and to the point, ot the job done and is very knowledgeable in many fields of law. I would highly recommend her to friends and family. Exceeded my expectations. Thanks Greta!
