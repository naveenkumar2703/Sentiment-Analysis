4	I ate here for the first time at this particular restaurant and loved the authenticity of their food..their salsa was good! I had the fish tacos..they were fresh tasting, no fish flavor at all=]I had a beer for only $2.25(i believe). My husband had an octopus tostada..which when i took a bite of, it was delicious.So, if your looking for a yummy mariscos place to eat where they are friendly and it's clean, i would go back again, for sure!
4	We go here for great Mexican seafood. My husband always orders some type of seafood there and is very happy. I love their beef and their chilaquiles-Yum! Their salsa is very tasty and fresh. The prices are incredibly low, the staff is friendly, and the place is very clean. A great place for a relaxed evening!
1	I went to this place because I had a restaurant.com certificate but they did not honor saying that the owner did not authorize it...which is fine i can get a refund. Anyway i love seafood...we ordered and it took a while to start getting our food. I got the coctel de camaron which was ok. Then my husband got his botana de camaron con pulpo...it was so small for the price i couldnt believe it! It tasted good though...my biggest dissappointment though was the ceviche de camaron...the moment i saw it i knew i was not going to eat that...it was so raw...like completely raw...i returned it and was told its because it takes a day to cook ot completely with the lemon...youre telling me? Ive been eating this all my life i know jow to make ceviche and it takes an hr or a little more...but its a restaurant it shouldve been ready for customer. People were nice...but wont be returning...at least to this location. Ill stick to Mariscos Playa Hermosa or Islas de Capitan both in Phoenix.
