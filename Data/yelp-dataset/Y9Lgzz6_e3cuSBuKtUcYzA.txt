5	The service people are quick and friendly without much chitchat.  They just get the job done.  They are thorough, hitting all the basic maintenance requirements such as checking for dirty air filters and tapping off the fluid supply wells.  I feel confident they are doing an excellent job without skipping vital areas due to maybe having a bad day or something.  Several times they have suggested a service that I really needed, physically showing me the dirty filter or what-have-you. This has save me expensive trips to the dealership and saves me time to get it done on the fly.  I'm not saying avoid the dealerships recommended inspections, but these guys will get you by until you do.  Be sure to ask the serviceman about the services offered because this place is much more than an oil change.  Oh, yes, the place is clean, has separate washrooms for men and women.  Air conditioned sitting room.  Sometimes they have a pot of coffee brewing for you.  There's not much in the way of eateries nearby in case you want a quick bite.
5	Definitely going to be coming back....Gilbert said 45min to service my ride and it was done 45 on the dot! Great service, friendly, honest, straightforward,  did not try and get one over on me like some mechanics ive dealt with before
5	This is by far the best place I've ever had my oil changed. The guys here are super friendly, fast and honest I trust their advice when it comes to my car. The waiting area is always spotless.They never try to push you to get something done they only make suggestions for your car when it need it.
