5	One of the best dentist offices around. Staff is very caring and Dr. Hakes is always on time, does not keep you waiting.
5	Dr Hakes and his team, especially Carol, are fantastic.  If you are in the Tatum Ranch/North Phoenix area, you should find your way to their office.  Second on the other review where their office is very organized and they are always on time.
5	I have been going to Dr. Hakes for a few years now. Mostly I go there to get my teeth cleaned by the hygentist Carol. She is wonderful!  She very thorough and knowledgeable about your dental health.  I had my wisdom teeth pulled by Dr.Hakes and he did a good job, had no problems.  The bad news is Dr. Hakes has sold the practice recently but I will still go back to see Carol to get my teeth cleaned, even if I have to find another dentist.
5	I've been going to Dr Hakes office for ten years and highly recommend his office - especially Carol who is amazing! She is gentle and does an excellent job. I also just met the new dentist, Dr. Curtis, who is very nice and personable.
