5	New location!
4	Anytime Fitness is a great gym!   They have great rates and the staff is super friendly.  Unlike any other gym I've been to Anytime Fitness gives you a key pass to enter the gym whenever you like.  This is great because it means that whenever I have the itch to work my hammies I can pop over.  Unlike like other gyms however they do not have group classes.  Instead in some locations they have a room where you can pop in an instructional video that works like a group class.  Though I generally do not take advantage of group classes, I would like the option.  With that said however, I have no major complaints with Anytime Fitness.  The gym is generally empty which means that there is no waiting for other members to get off the equipment.  All in all I would recommend Anytime Fitness!
4	For the price per month and selection of machines and free weights....a solid 4 stars! Like every gym, this place can get crazy busy between 3 and 6pm. But if you can avoid that you might have the place to yourself. I go in and work out some Saturday and Sunday mornings and I am the only person. It is great! I mostly use the free weights and treadmill, and their equipment is always clean. Plenty of TVs on with the remotes easy accessible to change a channel. Friendly staff willing to help you out with any need.I would recommend this location to anyone just looking for the basics.
3	I went here with my girlfriend a few times. Seems fine. I don't have a membership at any gym so I can't compare but I can't say anything bad about it.
