5	Dr. M. is an excellent Dentist. I have been going to his office located at Elliot and Cooper in Gilbert for several years and I have always received exceptional service. I would highly recommend Dr. Mazaheri and Exceptional Dentistry to anyone who is looking for a great Dentist who will really take good care of you.  I recently went to him for a single porcelain veneer which had cracked on me. I was concerned the replacement would not match my other veneers. Dr. M. matched it perfectly. Not even my wife could tell which one Dr M. had replaced. He is the Michelangelo of Dentistry! I am very happy. He is very talented.  Hi office is very beautiful, and takes your stress away with flat screen TV's with movie channels, massage chairs, and a beautiful huge colorful salt water aquarium. His staff is very friendly. Thank you to Brooke, Maggie, Allie, and Analisia. They are very efficient and you rarely have to wait at all.  Dr. M is very straightforward and tells you the facts about what your teeth need. His prices are very competitive. Dr. M. cleans your teeth himself! I always leave his office feeling really good about my smile and my teeth.   Thank you Dr. M. and team!!  I am a patient for life!David Sambell Gilbert, Arizona
