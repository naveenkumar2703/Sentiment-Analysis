4	Went to my first class last night, the belly dance fun with Ava and thought it was fantastic. The instrcuter was funny and helped everyone that needed it. It was a great vibe and a variety of women. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to go back to another class.
5	I'm not sure if it was all the giggling or all of the wiggling, but I do know for sure that my abs were begging me for mercy after taking one of Ava's all level belly dance classes.  Ava is an excellent instructor who really takes time to make sure each student "gets it," but more importantly, she makes sure everyone has FUN.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  Go.  Dance.  Laugh.  Invite some more joy into your life.
5	First, Al Moro.  Then, Silk Road.  Now, Studios 806.  Why all the name changes? I couldn't tell you.  The dance studios have remained a great place to practice your style of dance.  For diversion, there are pictures by local artist for sale on the walls outside the studios.  The studios themselves feel professional with hard wood floors and huge mirrors.  In the studio we practice in is a beautiful mural on the back wall. I train with Yumi La Rosa. I have been with Yumi since traveling to Spain with her about one and a half years ago.  My daughter joined shortly before the trip and my wife joined a year or two before either of us.  We all love practicing and performing with Yumi.  Yumi produces a show with Ava, who is the owner of the studios in the Spring at Tempe center for the Arts called Mujeres.  Ava teaches belly dancing.  I enjoy seeing the belly dancing numbers at Mujeres.  There are three dance studios at Studios 806.  During my daughter's class is a burlesque class.  I like listening to the music emanating from the room as I wait for my daughter's class.  If you are interested in learning a style of dance, I would recommend seeing what is available at Studios 806.
