1	We are retired and have gone to this McDonald's since they built it two blocks from our house.  This last year it has gone down hill.  They are out of things often, week after week.  The service has become poor.  Some of the long time employees are good but the bad now outweighs the good at that location.The street people hitting you up in the drive through and inside but the managers will do nothing about them.  Talked to the owner and he said he would see thing get better but they did not.  After all these years we decided we no longer need McDonald's and have not been in three months.  We have ten grandkids that are not missing it either.  Poor service has cost them a lot when you think about it over the years.
1	My mom and I went here for sodas around the night I moved back, they tasted normal. My husband and I got sodas this morning and I cant even describe how awful they tasted! We promptly threw them out and went somewhere else. On top of that the panhandlers and drug addicts asking for money (both times) is ridiculous. Plus, we could barely understand the lady talking through the order box in the drive through.Don't go here!
1	Worst one I've eve been too! I was number 205 and I waited for ever and ever, and the manager was giving out the food and saw me standing there forever and she didn't ask me what my order was or anything. It got up to 216 when the cashier had to ask me what my order was. So slow and disorganized and barely any space to eat and sit down.
