5	Nice place..
5	I was in Vegas for a short biz trip, after standing all day at the booth, super exhausted, found this place on yelp, went in, pretty lay back environment, what great about this place is they explain everything in details, no hidden fees like places in LA, got an hour and half foot care, head back to hotel, what a day.  Thumbs up! Appreciate too for the new customer discount Nicole gave to me.  Definitely a place to stop when next in Vegas! Absolutely worth my 5 star rating!
4	Very Nice Place...Relaxing...quiet and of course a great rejuvenating foot massage and body
4	I received a voucher from a friend as a gift, and never having been to a foot reflexology place before, I wasn't sure what to expect. To be perfectly honest, because its open so late, a little voice in the back of my head was saying "oh god, i hope this isn't one of "those-kinds" of asian massage parlors".  The voucher was for an hour foot reflexology & massage with salt scrub. I thought it was all going to take place on my feet...but was completely wrong. The massage started on my head, then neck and shoulders, then arms. When she got to my legs she did the salt scrub and massage. I thought it was over, but then she had me flip over onto my belly and gave me an amazing back massage too. The place was clean. The ladies were nice. The gigantic chaise lounge that is actually a massage table, was so comfortable that I swore to myself I would have one in my home one day. I didn't have to get undressed and lay under a little white towel like you would at a typical massage place...so I was far more comfortable and able to relax more. And for the price - you can't beat it! Will definitely be going back!
1	THE WORST!!!!!  I made an appointment and then when I arrived they told me to come back in 1.5 hours.  So unprofessional!
