5	Top Notch Care! I had shoulder shoulder Arthroscopic peformed by the BEST Nathan Richardson!!!! Kind, Gentle, Strong and Professional!! The Staff his assistant/nurse was the Best as well. If I need ANY bodypart worked on suegically it will always be CORE no mattter where I am I will fly back for all my needs..Hopefully no time soon ;-)The Core Really sticks by it's "core" values...This is the Route folks!!!
1	This place was not very comfortable feeling and seemed very restrictive. What was the point of putting on a paper gown and feeling like a doofus for not knowing how to put it on , then having it rip. Not a good experience. The Doc was knowledgable but demanding to the staff. Didn't really show respect for the rest of the staff.
1	Most disgusting attitudes from staff and Dr's. And treat you with no care or feelings and very discriminating.
