5	Love love love this place. Its the cleanest, quickest tanning salon I've ever been to. 9 times out of 10, I walk in and literally keep walking to the room Christine tells me is open. No stopping. Thats it. Also, she is the sweetest thing in the world. She always asks me how my session was even though I razz her for it.They used to have a can of spray deodorant in the booths to freshen up after a session. Maybe do that again? That was an unique touch since I've never seen that before at other salons and no one really wants to face the rest of their day smelling like sweat and lotion.
5	I really love this place! I know what you must be thinking....how great could it be, it's just a tanning salon! Well I have been to most salons on the west side and this is by far the cleanest and most effective! The rooms are nice and spacious, not tiny like other locations. The floor, walls, mirrors, stereos and most importantly the beds are very clean. Some tanning salons have an inch of dust surrounding the bed but not here! Today I tried the level 3 bed (I normally do level 1 or 2) and I couldn't believe the amount of color from just one session. I have done level 3 beds at other locations, but never saw much color so I figured why pay the extra money if I get the same color on a cheaper bed. The first time I came here I got a better tan on the level 1 bed than compared to other places upper level beds! They also have the spray tan and new red light therapy! I haven't tried the RL therapy but when I do I will update! Kristina is super nice and very informative about tanning and anything related to it! I highly recommend!
5	I love this tanning boutique!  I've started tanning again after 16 years out of the sun. The beds are excellent!  Very clean & high tech!! Staff is always nice! Felt a difference after 1st session. GO Vitamin D
