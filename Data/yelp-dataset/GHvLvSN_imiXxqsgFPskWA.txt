5	My family has been going to Dr. Killian for years now and he has always been an extremely good dentist, very kind, professional, and comforting when it comes to some of the more serious procedures. Not only that, he has just recently updated his facility via a $1 Million investment! He now has luxorious massaging dental chairs, state-of-the-art equipment and even a moveable LCD TV above the chair so as to relax you while you're worked on! The lobby is gorgeous with a massive 60" some odd LCD HDTV etc. This is an EXCELLENT dentist. He has been in the business for, well since before i was even born! which is over 20 years, so he knows exactly what he is doing. Also his son just moved into the building so there are now 2 great dentists working in the same building.
5	Dr. Killian is our family's favorite dentist, including my husband the dentalphobe, and our two young daughters. We appreciate the beautiful facility, private rooms, gentle hygienists and top notch dental care.
5	The clinic itself is very, very nice. They had Frozen playing and just about any good magazine you'd want to read in the waiting room. Everyone was very friendly and went out of their ways to make sure I was comfortable at all times. Dr. Brent could have easily said I need a few new fillings--how am I to know? That makes me feel like they're serious about their work and not in it for the money. I know a few people who have been told they need work done when they didn't. I trust that the Killians don't do that. Dr. Brent also seemed to know his stuff. I don't even like the dentist and I'm looking forward to going back!
