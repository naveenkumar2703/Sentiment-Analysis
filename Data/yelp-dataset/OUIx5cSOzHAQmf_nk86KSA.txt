5	I have been taking my baby Sophie here for a very long time, she's a shih-tzu and her hair gets matted easily, at the good groomers, they always take care of her(even though she's not the nicest to work with) they always do a great job. They de-matt her and make her look super cute everytime :)I would 100% recommend the Good Groomer to anyone and everyone!
3	I called the Good Groomer salon a day before I was planning to drop my dog off, they were able to get me in with a few different times open, so I was pleasantly surprised. I was even happier when I went to drop off my pup and saw that this groomer had rooms available so the larger dogs don't need to be crated. Very thoughtful.Everything was great, until I came home and saw how choppy the cut was on my little guy. His face and head was oddly hacked up, and there were several spots on his body that were also uneven. :(The pricing at this shop isn't incredibly competitive, and for the quality of service it's not a good value. This seems like a generic grooming salon- nothing special but I would recommend this place in a pinch. I have a groomer that I like and that does a phenomenal job; however, she is located across town and it's hard to get there to drop him off and pick him up. Although I'd definitely prefer to use that groomer, it would be nice to find a groomer on my side of town so we could get him cleaned up more often and after my visit to the Good Groomer, I don't think I'd be back before trying out some other groomers in NLV.
5	This place is hands down the best they do a  really good job with my dogs and the customer service is great. I recently moved to the SW side of town but I'm wiling to make the drive to have my dogs in good caring hands.
5	New location - 215 & Decatur (Aliante area) - BEST place ever!  Great customer service; my babies feel safe and comfortable
