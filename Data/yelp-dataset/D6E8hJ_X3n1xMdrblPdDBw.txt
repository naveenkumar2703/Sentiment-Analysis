4	As snack kiosks go, the Circle K on McDowell is pretty top notch. So many Circle Ks let the hot food sit out forever, but I can always get a fresh Diamondback Dog or Rib sandwich. The people there are great.
3	Friendly staff, but wish they keep the store a little cleaner.
2	Why talk about a gas station on yelp?  I dunno....Is it in a convenient location?  Yes, it's like in the middle of Galvin on the way in to Scottsdale.Is it spic'n span? No, it's a gas station. Do they have a beer cave? Yes, it's just as glorious as any other. Is it over run with homeless people?  Nope, you should feel as comfortable as one can at a gas station. I stop here pretty regularly being that it's on the way home from work, they have gas and beer. Good enough for me.
5	I Have been going into this circle k store for years, The people that work there are so fun, especially Betty. She makes my day and the rest of the staff are all great. The store is clean and outside is always clean also.
