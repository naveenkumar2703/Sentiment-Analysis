4	I really do love going to Starbucks and this one is RIGHT by my house.  YEAH!  It's usually busy, but the line goes fast.  The ONLY complaint I've had about this one are the vagrants that hang around from time to time.  They aren't always there, but when they are, it stands out in your head.
3	This is a strip mall east of the strip on S Maryland. It is a Starbuck's what can you say? I bought $30 gift card for a door prize. That was pretty easy to do, and probably well liked by its recipient.There is a grungy element that hangs out from time to time around here. This is the side of Las Vegas you weekend on the Strip in the Show/Spa/Casino from Cali don't get to see. OF course, you can just go back to California and find it all day, too!

3	So sad this place didn't last. Now I have to travel to the one on paradise and Sahara. The vagrants that hung around probably scared away everyone.  This shopping center is notorious for that!
