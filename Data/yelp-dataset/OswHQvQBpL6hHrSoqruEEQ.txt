4	So our last visit seemed normalFood prep time about usualI walk up to check on it and to my surprise they were about to call my number.the little woman behind the counter said "We are sorry for the delay, we added 2 extra pieces of fish for you".Said thank you and was Very impressed
3	First off, very clean restaurant ... But long wait time as they are preparing the food fresh can be annoying... Visited twice last weekend, and waited 30 minutes on 2 burgers and 2 shakes!!! At least the staff was friendly enough and refunded the whole amount.
5	Great place for hot, fresh nostalgic food blast. Had A&W with my mom here before she passed in 2011. Memorial bike ride today so stopped here to remember our lunches together. The counter staff was very friendly and the food came out hot and delicious! Just a little wait because its made fresh but not too long. Miss you mom!
4	Food is the same.  Prices are the same.  What this place has that most don't are the people.  The staff always make the difference and the young man that was at the register was soft spoken but patient and smiling.   Glad to stop in at an LJS and not regret it, for once.
