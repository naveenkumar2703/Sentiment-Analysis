5	Can't say enough about this class!! You'll drop all other workouts for this full body sweat down :)
5	Dance Trance is AMAZING!  The instructor, Juliet, has great energy and enthusiasm.  The music is fun and current, and the choreography is challenging, yet doable!  You don't even realize you are working out because you are having such a good time.  I totally recommend it for people who are bored with their gym routine
5	This class is awesome! I've danced my entire life, all different styles, and Dance Trance is great for any adult looking for a hip hop class. In high school, I took Culture Shock company classes and this reminds me of those a bit. The teacher, Juliet, is very inviting and breaks all the choreography down so you pick up the dances quick. The other students are welcoming, not cliquey like many other studios. Please try this if you're looking for a fun way to do some cardio, strengthen your body or enjoy some dancing. I'm so happy this exists in Vegas.
