1	DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM!!!  The last order I made with them, they did not pay attention to my instructions, and delivered my order on the wrong date.  they did not return any of my many frantic emails and phone calls to rectify the situation!  The food from my $100 order spoiled on my dad's doorstep!!!  Auwe!  Shame on you!   And I was a repeat customer.......but no more!
5	Awesome Customer Service and Website at www.hawaiianfoodonline.com Huge selection of online hawaiian favorites with quick shipping.
