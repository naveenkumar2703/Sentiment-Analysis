5	This a wonderful place to learn music. They are very patient and compassionate with children. Ive observed some of the lessons and they're great with kids particularly young kids. They didn't have rigid requirements about age so if you want to start tour child early, this is the place to go. My child is excited to come here for classes. Their pricing is more than reasonable.
