5	Soy de Monterrey Nuevo Leon y me encanta la comida mexicana siempre y cuando se autentica, batalle mucho para encontrar buenos tacos pero por fin los encontramos! Super rico, aunque lamentablemente el servicio deja mucho que desear (no toman la orden bien, encargas algo y se les olvida y terminas llendote cuando ya no tienes tiempo) pero fuera de eso los tacos estan riquisimos, 100% recomendable
4	Hello Rocky Point tacos!  That's right, I was driving by this place looking for a used car in a tougher part of town and could not pass trying out their carne asada tacos.   It was just like street tacos.  The service is normal, the atmosphere is what is expected (see picture), the food was pretty cheap.  Don't take your date here but if you are having a craving for street tacos you should stop by.
5	This the area you bring a friend with you and be sure both of you have a gun. But the food is more than worth it
5	I was here a couple of days ago had to come back tonight and knowing me and how good the food is here I will more than likely be back this week
5	I just can not get enough of the food here. Eating outside with a nice wind blowing. Sitting there eating and looking at all the street life just walking by, the fact that there is no menus or prices is a strange feeling, but you realize you do not care. You know you are hungry and you know what you want so why you need a menu? You know the going price for what you order so why would you need prices on this menu that you do not need. Just sit back order your food and enjoy
