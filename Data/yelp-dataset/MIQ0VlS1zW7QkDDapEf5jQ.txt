1	The overall experience wasn't too bad. I thought I would try this office because it was close to my house and quick for me to get to. I called and got a same day appointment for 5:30pm and when I got there I had almost no wait as the place was pretty much empty. The exam was fine but the problem came when I checked what they had billed my insurance. The amount billed for the appointment was triple the amount I have ever been billed by any doctor, in addition to that there was a 200 dollar charge for having an appointment later than 5pm, which I was never informed of when I made the appointment. The billing department assured me that if my insurance denied that charge they would not pass it on to me but I still do not support the idea of charging insurance crazy fees that in the end just drive up everyone's insurance costs. I will not be back.
1	I was fortunately only to have to deal with this company for a short time.  You are not allowed to contact your doctor without making an appointment, even if it's just them telling you everything is ok. I'm not paying a copay for that.  Will not go through my pregnancy with this company at all.  They are all pretty on the outside, but honestly that's just a front for the lack of competence inside.  I did like the doctor, may even see her at her other office not associated with the Goodman & Partridge practice.
