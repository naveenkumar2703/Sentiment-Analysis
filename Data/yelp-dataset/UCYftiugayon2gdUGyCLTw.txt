4	Ok if you've never had frozen custard before...and you like ice cream....then you gotta try this. They make their own custom flavors plus there are mix ins. Usually every week there's something different. Always your standard chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. Sometimes coffee, banana, peach, etc.....very creamy and smooth texture. Yea...very fattening....
5	Only been here once but it was good! Good enough that we took home 2 pints & a 6 pack of their Frozen Custard sandwiches. I think they were called bear paws or something like that... I haven't been to Luv-It's yet so I can't compare the two. But what I can say is that if you're an ice cream lover and you're in North Las Vegas, YOU GOTTA TRY RITTER'S FROZEN CUSTARD!!!
