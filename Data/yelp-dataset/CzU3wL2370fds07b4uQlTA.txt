4	What a fun place to hang out at the Westin Kierland.  Waltz & Weiser Saloon had something for everyone.  In our case it was drinks for the adults, shuffleboard and the rest of the resort for the kids and food for everyone.  Even billiards.  It's a little hard to find.  From the lobby you have to go through the lobby bar, down the stairs toward the golf course, then take a left just before you get outside and go almost to the end of the hallway.  Unlike the rest of the Westin, it's dark and cave-like.  A little more informal and comfortable.  Like the rest of the Westin, we had excellent service and pretty good food at premium resort prices in the upscale resort atmosphere.   Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a place to relax for a couple hours.
4	Great pub to grab a drink...either inside or outside on the patio!  They have shuffleboard and a pool table next door.
4	Cool bar with late night food.  The burger with green chile is pretty delicious.  Grab a drink and sit by the fire outside or hopefully you will catch the bag pipes guy at sunset.
4	Waltz & Weiser Saloon is a great place to become inebriated while at the Westin Kierland Resort in Scottsdale. I walked in here with about 150 other people and considering the mass demand for cocktails, the bartenders really kept up and provided excellent service throughout my visit. They have IPA on draft, which was awesome, and they pour relatively strong mixers considering this is a resort bar. A drunk golfer dropped and subsequently broke a tall glass full of Long Island Iced Tea and the staff cleaned it up in record time and even remade thew man's drink without batting an eye. Spot on service, really.They also have a man that appears at sunset each night with a set of bagpipes and he plays a song or two to serenade the evenings arrival. This is either really cool or really annoying depending on your take on bagpipe music.
