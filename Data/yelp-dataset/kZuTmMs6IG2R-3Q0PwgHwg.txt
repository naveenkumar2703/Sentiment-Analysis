3	The Melville Monument was one of the first things I saw upon arriving in Edinburgh and interested me simply because I didn't know who the person at the top was nor why it was built for him.  Normally you recognise the name of those with such great statues devoted to them (42.6m to  be precise), but Henry Dundas who stands proudly at the top was an unknown to me.A bit of research told me that he was the 'uncrowned King of Scotland' for his political standings which sounds impressive enough.  Unfortunately, his history then got very political and I lost a fair amount of interest, but it is a great statue to stand below and gaze up at.  At only 18 years shy of 200 years old, it is also an outstanding piece of engineering and well worth taking a peak at if you are passing.
