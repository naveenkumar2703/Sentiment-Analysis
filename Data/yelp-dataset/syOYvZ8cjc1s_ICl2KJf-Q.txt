5	My toe issues were cured from Dr. Burns. Thank you so much for your service.
5	Dr. Burns is a friendly, experienced doctor that I would recommend to anyone that has foot issues.  I've been to many foot doctors in southwest USA and Dr. Burns is the best!.
1	No help at all. Does not listen. Kept waving a wooden model of a foot at me. Told me I have arthritis when, in fact, I have a severely torn tendon in my foot. For this I had to pay?  Found out other DPM's are getting patients from Burns with the same complaints.
