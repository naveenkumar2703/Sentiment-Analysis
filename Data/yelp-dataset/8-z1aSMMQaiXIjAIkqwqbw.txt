1	God this place this awful, admittedly I am a bit of a film buff who primarily enjoys independent and European cinema, but even if you do like Hollywood dross starring Jennifer Aniston and Vin Diesel, it's still a terrible video shop.The staff are unhelpful (I was sneered at by some spotty emo kid when I unfortunately decided to visit), the selection of films is pitiful (they mainly have recently released titles, which sucks if you want to rent out something made in the 1970s) and it's expensive to boot. I really hope the recession hits this place hard and they are forced to go into administration. Sorry, but it really is that bad.
1	Back at my parents' gaff in Preston I used to go to Blockbuster quite a lot. And I never had any problems at all - it was reasonably well stocked and cheap. So when I moved to Edinburgh I went to this place to rent a couple of films.Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear. Horrendous. It feels unclean, for a start. Dirty. The film selection is lamentable. They have chick flicks and big budget action films and not much else. It's really really poor. Sure it's cheap, but then so is McDonald's and I don't eat there.The worst part about the whole thing was I did end up leaving with a film. I got the brilliant, brooding Harry Brown (watch it if you haven't seen it yet, Michael Caine is great in it). But the film kept skipping at the vital moments, which completely ruined the film. When I took it back in they didn't even apologise. The guy just looked at me as if to say 'Well, look at this place. What did you expect?'. Utter rubbish.
