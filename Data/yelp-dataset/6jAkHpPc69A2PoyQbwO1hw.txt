3	It's not what it use to be. :/
5	When we were getting close to our due date and the panic to find a pediatrician set in, I was lucky to come across Estrella Pediatrics and especially Dr. Bennett. His bedside manner from the very beginning was very nurturing and has a really patient demeanor. One added bonus to this office is the split waiting room- half for the sick children and half for the children who are there for well-child visits. I've been on both sides of that wall and it makes me feel a lot better that my little guy isn't getting sneezed on when he's not sick and not contaminating some other poor kid when he is.

5	This place is great. The office staff are very friendly. I take my daughter to Dr. Grassl and she is amazing. I moved to the area about a year ago and I was so worried about a new pediatrician for our daughter. Dr. Grassl has been wonderful. She is very attentive and makes my daughter feel comfortable. She askes alot of questions and never rushes through the appointment.
