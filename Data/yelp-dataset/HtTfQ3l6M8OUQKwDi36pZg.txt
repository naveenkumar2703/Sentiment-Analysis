5	This is an amazing little store with goodies from all over Europe, mostly eastern European countries. Ana is from Romania, the store prior to Ana's arrival was all Russian. We get some amazing food from here, that you won't find in the local Groceries. For example yesterday I cooked Ana's homemade skinless sausage. I will be getting more of those, I tell ya. She has had some cured salmon that with cream cheese and a bagel that is a piece of Heaven. Wines, cheese, meats, Jams, Pickles, spices and so much more. Walk in and talk to Ana... your tummy will thank you!
5	We love Ana and we love Ana's store!!! The most important thing for my husband and me is the friendly attitude of the host. She's amazing))) We would definitely come again!
