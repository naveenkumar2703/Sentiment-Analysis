4	I've been to a few Peckhams in Edinburgh, but none feel as classy as this Stockbridge branch. It lures you in! On a warm day there are always people sitting outside and it is always busy.I quite fancy myself as a viticulturist, and the selection of wine here is amazing. I didn't even recognise the majority of the bottles and names, and I think it showed on my face as I was helped within 3 minutes of coming in. The staff were lovely and really happy to helped, and they knew what they were talking about.I then had a cake and sat outside watching the world pass me by. Their selection is great and quite reasonable for the size you get! It is a bit pricey, however, but it's Peckhams!
5	Oh, I lurve Peckhams. I always have. My pocket hates Peckhams, though. With reason. Because of its olives. And its cheese. And its cheesecake. And oh god. My pocket melts whenever it crosses Peckham's threshold. This Peckhams is smaller than the other ones I've been to in Bruntsfield and Newington. And it has its own cafe, where the others seems to have whole separate underground restaurants (do not quote me on this). There's little to say about it that would set it apart from the other two shops (the other two shops I've been to). They have a deli and an alcohol section. They have pretty decent coffees. I'd even say that I had one of the best lattes in Edinburgh there (don't quote me on this either: I don't want to make the staff big-headed unless I get some free caffeine outta the deal).So, if you're in Stockbridge, stop by for a panini and a latte. Definitely have some cake too.
1	Peckham and Rye are in administration and this shop has already been sold off.Not that surprising given their pricing , their items are now available through a far wider variety of outlets and they failed to really create any sort of unique selling point or draw.
