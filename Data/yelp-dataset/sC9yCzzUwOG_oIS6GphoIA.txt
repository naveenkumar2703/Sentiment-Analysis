5	Full service salon great stylists and nail specialists! You can buy just about any product you want there and good prices! Everyone has a smile on their faces and are great at what they do! A must!
4	Every time I stop in this location, the service has been great.  The girls behind the counter are always willing to walk around with me and find what I need.  It is not a large location and many times the shelves look bare in some areas, but I can get the most popular brands.  I choose this location when I just need my Morrocan Oil products or just need to get in and out quickly.  Larger locations like Ulta are overwhelming to me sometimes.
