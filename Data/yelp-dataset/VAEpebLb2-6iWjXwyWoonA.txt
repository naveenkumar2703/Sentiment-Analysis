5	The shop owner, Jim, is terrific--helpful, straightforward, and friendly. Prices are great for rentals but the quality is still top notch. Rented for an out of town wedding and was very happy. By the way, some of the cheaper rentals are still really good but you might not know about them unless you visit, so check them out in person.
1	Worst customer service experience ever!!!!! I asked the owner if he was going to have my husband try on the shirt for the tux we rented. He wouldn't respond to me at all and was extremely rude to me. DO NOT SHOP HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	So my dear friend stopped in here today while I waited in the car... He asked for some info on renting a Tux for his upcoming wedding and the person basically booted him out of the store !! Not sure if hes the owner or what but he conducted himself very poorly... When my friend inquired , the store worker stated he didnt feel he was in there as a serious customer and told him he had 2 seconds to vacate the store. I was so baffled by this I had to report so that others will know this place is NOT friendly or worthy of any decent persons business.
1	WOW!. What a angry man. I was 2 days late with bringing the tux back and he calls me screaming and told me there was a late fee. I said fine , its ok , calm down i don't mind paying the fee. He threatened me. Crazy man.
5	I was pleased with this rental.  The man was very nice who took my measurements and quickly and easily finished everything.  I have rented for many occasions from different shops and this was one of the best I have been to.
