1	WORST BUFFET EVAR!The food was gross, the service was slow, and it was the worst 25 dollars my bf and I have had the misfortune of spending on food. Seriously, we barely ate anything and when we asked to speak to a manager, he offered to comp our sodas... that's it. Worthy of a health department inspection.
2	Wow-wee-wow! I didn't hate this place; I sure liked it a lot better than the previous reviewer (Tiger W.), but it was rather mundane.... 'ho-hum', if you will. Not terrible at all, just nothing special. Good if you're hungry and not looking for a fancy-schmancy experience. I recommend on those terms. Good price.
2	I stopped going to this place years ago. the food is horrible and the people are sooo rude. and the seafood made me sick. don't waste your time or money
