4	I used to use Aliante cleaners all the time....well there was a huge problem with my alteration they did make it right. Thank you to the manager and owner, greatly appreciated!! They stand behind their work. I like that.
4	My good friend gave me a bunch of work suits, so I opted to take them here.  This is my first experience with a Las Vegas dry cleaner so price wise I couldn't say if I got a good deal or not.  4.99 for each jacket, suits were the same, so to me it felt like a BOGO kind of deal.  I also had a long winter coat that was around twenty dollars.  Overall it came to about 85 dollars for two bags of clothes.  My only gripe was that it took longer than the slip said.  Five days turned into ten days, but the garments are clean and they smell good.  The skirts were neatly clipped up on the hangers and everything is pressed and looking ready to wear.  They must get a lot of business because there was a line out the door each time I've come here.  I also noticed that other cleaners vans parked outside picking up stuff so they must do good work, or they are part of a chain.  They offer alterations and advertise for quilts and wedding dresses.  I asked if they would dry clean my purse.  (Which has seen better days, seeing as I dropped it in a mud puddle last winter.)  They said they would take it.  So I'll be back.
3	They seem to be a little more expensive than most cleaners.  they do not offer same say service, it usually takes 3 days.  Expediting will cost more.
2	In my opinion and compared to other places in town, overpriced and slow turn around.  Yes their location is convenient, but would rather find a place a little less convenient and worth the money.  My items did come back nicely pressed and don't doubt they do a good job however.
