5	I was out of town for a while and I was in major need of getting my hair cut and colored. I always have a hard time trusting new stylist, especially with my Asian hair. It was a big risk but I decide on Regis at the Fashion Mall. I had awesome experience here. Hayley, my stylist, was very knowledgeable and gave me what I wanted. I love my haircut and color. She did a wonderful job on my A-LINE stack haircut. LOVE IT! I highly recommend HAYLEY! She was lots of fun and professional.
5	Hayley works magic here.  I was concerned about going to a mall to get my hair done, but it's not an issue.  Appoints are always on time, no waiting for other to finish.  The color is perfect every time, no more gray here.  All the other women that work there are friendly and very talkative, makes a person feel welcomed.
5	I would love to keep Ahn a secret from everyone, but she is so good I can't help but write a review about her.  She actually listens to what you want done and lets you know if that's going to work with your hair. She is always on time for her appointments and never has me waiting.  She's efficient and quick, but doesn't rush through anything. I've been there to see other stylists, but the quality is not the same.  If you want an amazing cut and superior color, do yourself a favor and give her a call. Her experience in the business can't be beat!
5	I was desperate for a trim and partial highlight after a year of untouched hair. Of course, I decided it had to be done TODAY.  Thankfully, Bethany was available and gave me everything I wanted!!! My hair looks AWESOME! She is so nice, professional, and talented! Thank you!
5	Michelle did a great job on my 9 yr olds hair. I'm definitely coming back for myself.
