5	This is hands down the best coffee I've ever had. The baristas are friendly even to anti-social guy like myself.  I once cheated on Seattle Espresso at starbucks, but ended up throwing away my drink and heading over to Seattle anyway.  Try their Iced Moca, but get a double shot of espresso, its worth it! Oh, and their black and white cookies are some of the best I've ever had!  FREE WI FI TOO!

4	The drinks are excellent and staff is great. The patio has a nice feel, but the interior is a little compact and boring.
1	Not here. Just an Italian Bakery
