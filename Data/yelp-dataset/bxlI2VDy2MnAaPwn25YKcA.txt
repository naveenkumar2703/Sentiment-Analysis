5	I typically don't write reviews but I just had the best phone call with a MG & E representitive I had to come and rave about it. Upon calling the customer service line I was directed within (quite literally) 2 seconds to a very friendly representitive who was very helpful and informative while I was trying to change my service location. Keep up the good work MG &E customer  service.
5	Great phone service & support. Friendly, quick and helpful at sorting things out. Even when I was out of state for personal reasons, I called MG&E, said I didn't forward my mail. The kind midwestern voice on the other end never missed a beat; "Oh ok, no problem. You've always paid on time", they put a note in my file that gave a generous extention, though I ended up not needing it. Along with phone there's an online payment, mail (old school), and pay in person at various places. The automated credit-card bill payment line adds a $5-6 fee.They also have a solar program if you have a roof. Now, if those surges could be taken care of...or is it just my building's messed up wiring and routing?
