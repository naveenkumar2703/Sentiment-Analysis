5	Ever since the CMYE Yelp's Sweet Bake in-at  LGO Bake shop I've fallen into sweet love with LGO! From the tasty treats at the bakery, to the coffee counter, to the bakery, to the gelato spoon, to the bakery, to the grocery store, to the bakery,  tothe pizzeria and did I mention the BAKERY?!  They have the best and biggest cookies, I love them because they're not overly sweet and each has it's own unique & fabulous flavor! They have the best key lime pie on the planet, and so many other decadent desserts! The store is filled with a variety of adorable & unusual items you won't find anywhere else, perfect for the season of gift giving & exchanges. Tonight we had the opportunity to bring in our donations for RMDH, and shop local all while sipping tasty hot chocolate, and nibbling on cookies! We received a discount on our purchases and even received a $15 voucher for the newly opened restaurant next door(which provided dinner) all this to shop at my local beloved LGO! Thank you LGO & Lindsey for leading the pack in shopping local!
5	I was excited to see the Yelp was doing a Local Shopping Party at LGO.  It was fun walking around and seeing all the cool things that LGO sales for Christmas.   This year I decided to buy a game at LGO for my Christmas gift for my family.   Hopefully the game will be fun.  :) Thank you Lindsey and LGO for a wonderful evening of shopping.  Also for the awesome cookies and hot chocolate.
4	This event was held at La Grand Orange.  This was an easy location to go to for shopping for me.  I go to LGO often enough and love their cookies.  I arrived at 5:30 on the dot.  Yelp had a table setup for "shoppers" who checked-in to pick-up their check-in offer sweet treat - for me, it was the mini-red-velvet cupcake.  I dropped off my cleaning supplies that I purchased for the Ronald McDonald House at the table.  We also received a sweet ticket to get a cup of hot chocolate and an invitation to try out the new restaurant in the LGO family that is located across the street.I ordered food and sat in the dining room.  I ate dinner and then went back to check out the offerings that LGO has.  I previously wrote a review about LGO.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix#hrid:gx2aCOeK4UAv7h2_jBB3AgBesides the food (salads, sammies, desserts), you can get an eclectic variety of games, coffee mugs and various other trinkets in the store.  Here are the links to the pics I took of the things in their store a few months ago. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?filter_by_userid=True&select=XfNKgRbVsXo_6-pb_F0ePw&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA#XfNKgRbVsXo_6-pb_F0ePwhttp://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3DFO8xOw0Bz_gNA44d2hxw/l.jpghttp://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6inoyyD0nrBf9XcU1yjunw/l.jpghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=YN5Vf1tXbANm1L0etkobQQ#YN5Vf1tXbANm1L0etkobQQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=7Ut5X_m74qV9EI7tFzht-Q#7Ut5X_m74qV9EI7tFzht-QI enjoy shopping local.  I co-organize a supper club UYE that almost exclusively supports locally owned restaurants and I usually eat at local places.  When I can, I do like to give my business to locally owned farmers and grocers.  Thanks to Lindsey and LGO for the invite to join. I am hopeful that next week's shop local will introduce me to more stores in the Phoenix area that interest me.
5	I haven't had a chance to attend many Yelp events this past year, so when I saw that this one was on my way home from work I decided to stop by.What a great event! I had the opportunity to see some Yelp friends, meet some others in person for the first time, and to support a local business where I picked up a Christmas present for my kids.I also recalled how much I liked this place when I used to come here nearly a decade ago... and I remembered what I don't like about LGO... the parking... or lack thereof.However, I am happy to see Yelp supporting local businesses and hope that these efforts continue even when its not the holiday season.
5	Yelp Shop Local Shopping Party at LGO??? Um yes I am in for that!! Not that I need a reason to go to LGO, I have been smitten with LGO for some time now.When I arrived I dropped off my items for the Ronald McDonalds House with Lindsey, Lindsey offered a free cookie SCORE for me!! Also received a voucher for free hot chocolate and a coupon for next door. And for this shop local event LGO offered 5 dollars off any purchase of 25 bucks or more.LGO's items for sale change often, that's one of the reasons why I enjoy coming, you can find unique things. For this shopping trip I did find some gifts I will be giving away at a white elephant party I'm attending in a few days.I also picked up some cookies, they are addicting!!!Thank you Lindsey & Yelp for setting up the shop local event at LGO and thank you LGO for having us!! See ya soon!
