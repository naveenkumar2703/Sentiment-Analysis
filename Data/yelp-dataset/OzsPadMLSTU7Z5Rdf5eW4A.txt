3	Had the new chipotle chicken sandwich.  Nothing to write home about, but got the job done satisfying my hunger.  The place has some tvs to watch and overall its pretty clean.
3	I rarely go to Arby's, but I wanted to try their Cravin' Chicken Sandwich, so I dropped in here one afternoon for lunch.  I ordered the Cravin' Chicken Sandwich.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arbys-scottsdale-2?select=TUEZOrAh5TK-nD3nyub6MQ#TUEZOrAh5TK-nD3nyub6MQIt's larger than most fast food Chicken Sandwiches and the flavor is pretty good.  Not too bad.  However, it wasn't good enough to get me 'addicted' so I would 'crave' it again.Return Factor - 50%
3	It's ok. I like the jr. hot ham & cheese sandwich. Today I ordered it with a jamocha shake, because it's hot outside, and shakes are cold, so I figured it would balance me out. The jr. ham & cheese sandwich is on their value menu (it's always weird and flattened looking no matter which Arby's I go to), so is the small jamocha shake (on the value menu I mean...not weird or flattened like the sammich). My hunger was satiated, the bill was cheap (for Arby's), and so far it has not made me sick, so I have no complaints. I don't go to Arby's very often, I'm not a fan of roast beast (unless it's a REAL roast with potatoes and stuff), but when I'm wanting a hot ham & cheese (and since there aren't any Hardee's around this joint) this is where I go...until I find a different venue that will gratify, satisfy and quiet my urges.
1	Ate at this Arby's on Sunday 7/06.  They were so focused on taking care of the drive through that it took them 30 minutes to prepare our simple order to eat in their dining room.  When we finally received the sandwiches they tasted like they were made 30 minutes earlier and left under a heat lamp.  They were a little above room temperature.  The fries were hot but over cooked.  We asked for our money back and left.
3	It takes FOREVER to get your order in the drive thru.
