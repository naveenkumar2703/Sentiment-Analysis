5	Don recently painted my house and I am extremely pleased with the results.  The price was very fair and his attention to detail was superb.  He patched many holes in the stucco.  He also painted the house quickly and even did things that were not previously painted like the doors and garage.  I have already sent him some referrals.  Thanks!
5	Don did a very good job of painting the exterior of my house.  His price was competetive, he started and completed the job on schedule, and did a good job.  He did minor stucco patches, too.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him.
3	I called for painting of my 3300 Sq ft home and interior block fence paint along with some minor stucco repairs.  They were not interested in this size of project.
5	Don recently finished our home.  He was a pleasure to work with and the finished project was perfect.  His quote was very competitive.  He started the job the day he said he would and finished a day early.  He takes great care with his prep work and truly treats your home as if it was his own.  It was a wonderful experience experience working with Don.
