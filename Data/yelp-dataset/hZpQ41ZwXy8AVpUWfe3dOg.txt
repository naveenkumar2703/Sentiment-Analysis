3	If you really look you can find nice clothes, but most of the stuff is cheap and shrinks the wrong way in the wash. I like coming here just because I know everything's going to be cheap anyway.I love the panties and bras. So many to choose from, and most of them are fun (or funny). Lots of cute shoes, too. Purses...meh. I've probably bought 1 or 2 purses here, but I don't usually check because I haven't seen anything to my liking too many times.
3	On the way to meet a friend for dinner The Better Half decided that she needed some hair accessory or something like that.....so we made a quick stop here to pick it up.  Normally, the lines are pretty long at a Ross, but for some reason this place was empty.  I told her to hurry up before the line got long as the cashiers at Ross are notoriously slow.Luckily, we were in/out of there in less than 5 minutes.Return Factor - 60%
4	Good selection of finer quality items. This particular location gets a nice inventory in, unless I happen to just be lucky enough to go at the best times of the day! I really enjoy the hunt sometimes, and I can't leave this store empty handed. I buy clothes as well as household and pet items here.
3	I had never been to this specific Ross before and was pleasantly surprised when I stopped by this weekend. I wanted to grab some candles (I'm suddenly addicted) and they had a rather large selection. All sorts of sizes and smells, it was fun to pick and choose. The entire store is rather large and easy to navigate. I didn't do much browsing, but this Ross seems to have way more stuff than a few others I'd been to. Also, it was pretty clean. (Didn't go into the changing rooms though, which can be a real sign on cleanliness.) Overall, it wasn't a bad experience. I didn't have to wait long in line, which is definitely a plus! If I'm in the area again, I'd stop by.
