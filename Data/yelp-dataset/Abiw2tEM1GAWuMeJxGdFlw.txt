5	We all know I love Sundrops Nail Spot and want to live there....because I can't (code violation or some non sense) I have been bugging Stephanie where she got the flower arrangements on the bar. They look so real! So, I went to the French Bee and low & behold was able to buy an arrangement for every room in the house. My favorite is the yellow rose arrangement that I have on my kitchen table....to increase wealth according to my feng shui handbook.  Great place, not cheap by any means but I won't have to buy fresh flowers that only last a week!
5	If my house was a store, I would want it to be The French Bee.  Such great great house stuff and even some cool jewelry.  The prices fluctuate on everything.  I saw a necklace that I had to have and figured it must be too expensive so there is no way  I can buy it but it was reasonable!  So reasonable that I bought 2! -- Don't you wish we were friends?  When i find something great, I buy them in multiples to give one away. The last time I was in there, it was around the holidays and they had the BEST CHRISTMAS STUFF!!!
5	WOW! Gorgeous Store! I went in today and was just mesmerized by all the beautiful gifts, flower arrangement and designer decor. I was greeted by all the staff inside which was really nice.Their Dried Floral arrangements are Amazing! It's great place to find a unique gift.Stop in and see for yourself, it's a real treat!!
