3	Decent nail salon, fair pricing for this area, good color selections. Service is your typical Viet salon... They try to upsell you constantly and when you say no they talk behind your back lol. My friend's lady was great, really took her time and did a great job on her gel manicure. I opted for a regular mani/pedi and my lady would not let me hear the end of it. Also nicked me but I doubt it was on purpose. I didn't like the flower she drew on my toes, its like she intended to draw one thing, screwed up and kept adding to it to fix it, turned out looking bad.  She was an older lady, someone's mother at the nail salon, so I felt kinda guilty and tipped her anyway. I think I'm just going to do my nails at home til I find a better place.
3	Visiting from out of state....average mani/pedi.  Nice clean shop, friendly technicians; way overpriced!.
5	Clean and comfortable salon with many services.  Staff is very friendly and creative.  They take appointments and always do a great job.  Prices fair and affordable.  I highly recommend Lena, she is a true nail artist an such a perfectionist.
