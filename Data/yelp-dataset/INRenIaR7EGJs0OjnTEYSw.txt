4	This location of Kohl's is a stand alone store.  It is new, nice, and pretty big.  Has 2 to 3 entrances to the store and a huge parking lot.  The store is mapped out and labeled well, so you just need to look up at the signs for the department you want.  The only minor set back, they are short of cashiers sometimes.
4	This store is never really too crowded and there's always plenty of parking. Every time I go there is always someone to help and the selection is always great. Even though the store isn't too busy, they do seem to only have one cashier working and so there is usually a line of 2-3 people.
5	Nice location! Very clean and organized. I visited this particular store for the first time to return something purchased at a different store. It was a pleasant surprise compared to the other one. Everything seemed to have a place and was in it. The cashier was very friendly and helpful, handling the exchange professionally and quickly. I was on my way in minutes. Excellent.
