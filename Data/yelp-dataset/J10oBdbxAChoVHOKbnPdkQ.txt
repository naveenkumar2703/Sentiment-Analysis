5	Wow!! I really have a tough time staying motivated to work out but this place makes we want to come back. I love the staff! It's the perfect size with unique equipment. You will see results! It's high impact without tramatizing you. They train any level up to professional athletes. The eye candy is not too bad either ;)
5	TR3 is way different than other gyms I've been to, but in a good way! It's open 24 hours so you can come whenever you want and isn't super busy so you can come in and get to your workout right away and not wait in lines. I really enjoy the turf and the different equipment they have unlike other gyms, and the trainers are willing to work with you on your schedual which is GREAT with my busy schedule. Everyone needs to check this place out it's fantastic!
5	Micheal was able to get me into the gym the next morning. The facilities are incredible, far more than I would expect. Of course a pleasant staff and atmosphere but with enough freedom to get in the workout I expect.
