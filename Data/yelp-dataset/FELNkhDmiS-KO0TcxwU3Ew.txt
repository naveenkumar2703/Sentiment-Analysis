3	A solid place to grab a quick lunch, drink, or snack in between classes.  This Einsteins is located inside the Science and Engineering building, right across from Ham Hall, and is reasonably quiet (at least whenever I've visited).  Service is usually good, from what I've experienced.The con: they're usually out of whole wheat bagel thins!  Come early to snag one.
3	When you need a snack and a place to study, this is the place to go and still stay on campus. It is a chain so the food is pretty consistent, it is easy and fast.
4	Need a quiet place to study away from the hustle and bustle of the SU?! Einstein Bros is probably your place then! Usually running rampant with science nerds and coffee lovers, EB is definitely a place to chillax and study without running into annoying talkers..or people who laugh too obnoxiously! Honestly, it is a good place to grab a blueberry muffin and a coffee; and then sit down and study with your laptop. I'll admit, their coffee is not the greatest..and neither is their food. Yet, you have to remember: You grabbed CAMPUS FOOD!!!! On-campus food is usually never better than it's "out of campus" counterparts! (Let's be honest.) But their blueberry muffins are one of the best nearby, I recommend that! Also, their service is pretty good. I have never had a bad experience because they treat their customers pretty well! HUGE TIP: Learn to share your table with strangers; it's college! :)
