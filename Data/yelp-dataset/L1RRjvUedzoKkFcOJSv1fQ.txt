5	Beautiful fabric selection for fine quilting. They have the full line of quality fabrics from Lakehouse and others. Also, wool project kits that are gorgeous. I go back once a month and always find something beautiful.
5	I have been meaning to stop in here for at least a month just to look around because I do enjoy looking through quilt shops even though I don't actually quilt.  The hours on the door indicate they are open till 8 or so but they're only open till 5.  I think the website does say that.  One reason I hadn't gotten by yet was because they aren't open very late.   The fabrics they carry are just beautiful and looked really good quality.  The prices are not cheap, I think I looked at a couple bolts in the $10 yard range but I would say well worth it if you want a good quality quilt.  They have a certain amount of accessories and embellishments as well. The lady who runs the store and her son were extremely nice.  I just walked around looking.   It was pushing 5 o'clock so I left. I didn't need anything so I didn't buy anything but I would highly recommend it to anyone who does do quilting.There is plenty of parking in the adjoining lot.
4	Retail area surprising small considering the log cabin building where it is located but they have a good amount of material, well displayed.   The spaces were well used so it did not feel crowded.Staff helpful and pleasant.  Majority of fabric tended to be floral and feminine but there were blenders and novelty designs.  There was a great selection of fat quarters.No restroom nor a place to sit inside but the porch had chairs for husbands.
