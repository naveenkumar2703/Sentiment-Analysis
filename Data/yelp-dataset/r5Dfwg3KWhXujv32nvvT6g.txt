5	My dog Zelda's newest name is Kujo. And she hates men. But Rodney wasn't afraid! I've boarded Zelda at the Doggie Dude Ranch 3 or 4 times now and she is calmer and better behaved each time I pick her up. Rodney has been extremely helpful, accomodating, and flat out awesome! Plus, the prices beat any other facility in town!!!
3	Doggie Dude Ranch (now Pet Planet) is okay. They had much better service in the past. I'm annoyed by the fact that I have to stand outside and call whenever I drop off or pick up my dog. Sometimes I've had to call several times. You can imagine that's a little unnerving when returning home after travel.. All you want to do is go home, not stand outside in 105+ degrees calling multiple times so you can get your dog. BUT, my dog seems to like it there. He's typically very mean and is a huge dog, so there are few places that will take him. He is always happy when I pick him up and the prices are some of the lowest in town. So, I wish their customer service was better, but my dog doesn't mind.
5	I have used Doggie Dude Ranch (pet planet) several times in the last year. I have a pain in the butt Chiuaua, but they are really good with him. I have found that it is easy to make reservations with them and the pickup and drop off process has been very easy. Lastly, they are great at helping me cut my little dogs nails and they always have him nice and bathed when I pick him up. They offer many services at a reasonable price. Plus I feel comfortable leaving my dog with them for 5 to 6 days at a time.
