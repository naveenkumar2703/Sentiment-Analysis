3	Oh nooo... another gourmet hot dog restaurant! Only suckers eat gourmet hot dogs and I, my fellow yelpers, am a sucker. I went on the first day of the partial opening of the Linq and to be expected not many people were there (actually no one except for my group and the workers). Its located right outside of O'Sheas and right next door to Purple Zebra. The menu (http://www.hautedoggerylv.com/menus/menu/)If you dined at any of the other Block 16 Hospitality restaurants (Public House, Barrymore, Holsteins, LBS, and Pink's) then you'll see a lot of similar ingredients and similar flavors, especially with Holstein's, a lot of their offerings have the same name. The El Machete was the only hot dog I tried. How was it? It was good, super clean tasting frank but it wasn't $8 good. Man I'm definitely a sucker or perhaps money is burning a hole in my pocket to be spending $8 on a hot dog. I definitely felt like I was eating that strip up charge. Of course in true Vegas fashion there must be something "VEGAS", and that is the Billionaire Dog (grilled Kobe beef frank, Foie Gras torchon, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo). Get em tourist!Next time? Nah... probably not.
5	Hole in the wall place on the strip. Extremely good for a quick bite. Inexpensive place. Great for veggies as they offer veg substitue for all hot dogs.
1	We were walking into the restaurant as 2 customers walked out and one told us "DON'T EVEN BOTHER." We didn't listen to the advice.The meal consists of tasteless grocery store hotdog with coleslaw, barbecue sauce and fries. The server asked if we want extra coleslaw, we found out why...It's because the hotdog is so tasteless you need extra coleslaw to add to the taste. The fries are OK.
2	First time in Vegas and was walking around the strip and ran across this joint. Hot dogs sounded uhmazing at the time so I decided to give it a try (and I had no idea Pink's was around the corner). I had the Fun-Ghi (char grilled Frank, grilled mushrooms, caramelized onion, gruyere cheese and truffle mayo). I had been burned previously with truffled flavored anything (since it is usually never really truffle). It sounded delicious though.The dog itself was good. Juicy and good flavor. Toppings...disappointing. Main reason being that it was all one note, one flavor (they were cooked well for what they were). Every ingredient on top was umami that it all just became overwhelming. I remember even waking up the next morning wishing I had ordered a different hot dog, specifically the Empire State dog. My boyfriend got the Detroit Coney Classic and he was satisfied. I tried it and it was much better. So, if you do go, I'd stick to the classics (classic for a reason, no? The balance of acids and textures always work). Hot dogs are made to be cheap good eats, they don't need fancy toppings.
5	The place was awesome. They had a great selection of hot dogs to choose from. They had a NY dog, a Detroit dog and even a DC half smoke. They also had some great chili cheese fries. To top it off they sold beer as well. Great place to get a bite to eat.
3	I love hot dogs so when I noticed this spot for a quick bite in the alley next to Q outside Flamingo I went for it. Food is pricey in Vegas so a quick bite was a nice change from the LONG lines for $$$ everywhere. No wait. I'm in! Great onion rings, Chicago dog was good, bun was a bit crusty, toppings good, but the Detroit Coney looked amazing. Guy next to me got his after I ordered. Noticed a lot of local employees popping in to grab a bite at the counter. Always a good idea to follow the locals and I was not disappointed.
4	I'm no hotdog connoisseur and I'm not into the whole "gourmet" hotdog thing, but the dog I had here on New Years Eve really hit the spot.I had the Tijuana Dog - bacon wrapped and deep fried frank, grilled onion and jalapeno with mayo - $7.30The Good: When I saw  "bacon wrapped frank" my mouth began to water, how could I resist? I just hoped it was as good as it sounded, and it was. The flavor of the bacon combined with the dog, grilled onions, and jalapenos was very tasty. The Bad:This is pretty minor and strictly cosmetic, but the dog didn't look all that appetizing when it came out. The bacon was nearly blackened around the edges and the dog had blistered up, I'm sure this was from the deep frier. I don't know if this could be avoided by shortening the cooking time by a few seconds or would it be just as good if it had been grilled? I don't know but this wouldn't stop me from ordering it again.The Indifferent:At first I was a little leery of the prices. 5.50 for a plain dog? That's a bit steep. But when I started looking at their more interesting offerings (like the Tijuana), I figured those prices were worth it for a unique hotdog experience I was unlikely to stumble across elsewhere.    It did take them a while to get our food but they were fairly busy and the wait wasn't annoyingly long.My only regret is I didn't have time to come back and try a couple of their other offerings before I left town. There are at least four or five other dogs on their menu I'd like to try on future visits.
3	Good, but not great. Overpriced for what it is. I ordered the Detroit Coney Dog (with Kobe hot dog) and the Polish sausage with peppers. The polish sausage was OK-you can find much better polish sausages at any grocery store. The Kobe dog was very good-juicy and flavorful. Everything else about the dog tasted like food-service quality buns, chili, and shredded cheddar cheese. Nothing special there. Overall it's a good place for lunch or if you've been drinking (it is located on the Vegas strip). A big critique is that two hot dogs and a drink costs about $20. Although it is located on the strip (tourist prices), you can certainly find much better places to eat for $20, even on the strip. My biggest critique is actually the menu. When you walk in the menu is located almost near the ceiling, so everyone is straining their neck to look at it. There's way too many types of hot dogs, each one  coming with a different type of meat for starters. There's Kobe dogs, grilled franks, polish sausage, steamed franks, etc. Then they all have catchy names, and the menu is divided into two sections of hot dogs. It's too much, too confusing. They should keep the menu simpler and make it easier to actually look at.  Now that I've tried it I wouldn't go back unless I was walking the strip with friends in the evening and wanted a quick snack to go with my beers.
3	This "Haute" spot is located in the Linq, and because the Linq is so cool, I thought this place would be cool! Little did I know, my expectations were way too high =/I walked in there, looked at the menu, and my eyes lit up when I saw the "Billionaire Dog". I know you all are waiting for it... but it was just A-OK. The billionaire dog consists of FOIE GRAS, which is the reason why my EYES LIT UP, a kobe beef dog (which was actually pretty good, but I wish the dog was a DOG though!), and some type of jelly. It was good, but it DIDN'T HIT THE SPOT. I know I am not the hot dog expert, but I do know what I like. I hope in the future, I give them another chance, and they SURPRISE ME!
2	I live for hot dogs and this place was not worth my time or money. The hot dog itself was fine, a natural casing pork and beef that would have been better but however they cooked it, it didn't have that snap that should have been there when you bite it. The bun was convenience store quality and seemed quite old. This was a $2 hot dog sold for $8. The girl working the counter did seemed quite knowledgeable about the dogs and was very nice and probably saved this place from a one star review.
4	Being frequent imbibers of the delicious bloody Marys at the Barrymore, the bartender there recommended we try their 2 newest "haute" spots, one being the Haute Doggery (and the Blind Pig which I'll also review next) So early one Saturday evening we ventured down to the Linq. It is an unwritten rule for Vegas locals to stay away from the Strip on the weekend. What were we thinking? A few words on the Linq dining & shopping area itself:  There is only one taxi drop off location and it's located under the new ferris wheel called the High Roller. You can also be dropped off at the Flamingo and schelp though the casino or at the IP oops wrong name - the Quad and schelp though. The Haute Doggery is on the strip side of the Linq so it's a schlep & with crowds, not that easy to navigate on a Saturday night - sober. The "Doggery" itself is bright and cheery. Extremely clean & well laid out. A variety of seating - and yes Fatastic seating. We ordered: Tijuana Dog - 4.95+ a perfect Kobe dog, wrapped in bacon and deep fried, garnished with a fantastic mix of jalapenos & onions and dressed with a light mayo. The only -1/2 point was for the ugliness of the actual dog after the deep fry. A victim of circumstance but close your eyes and take a bite..after that you won't care. Empire State Dog - 5+ - NOT a dirty water dog! - grilled to perfection and the red onion sauce we love. Just biting in made me homesick. Plain Jane - 5+ - we fixed ours up with extras like bacon and a slathering of garlic aioli. Order of crinkle cut fries 5+ delicious & brought back good memories of Saturday nights on the boardwalk at Coney Island. Some might think it's a tad expensive for a 'dog' but its KOBE dogs. not some generic out of the freezer case dog. The only down side was that it took quite a while for us to get our order and it came out piece by piece instead of all at once.  I can see this will be a problem once the High Roller opens and the crowds move in especially during huge events like the EDC & NFR.  Maybe by then they'll have their routine down and be faster at getting the orders out.It will be on my list to take visitors to when they want to 'see the strip' - Good Job!
2	Meh pretty much sums up this experience. It's small, quick eats place located on The LINQ. As an avid hot dog adventurer, I was excited to try it out. But unfortunately, nothing exciting was to be found here.The place was near empty when we walked in. The cashier was less than happy to be there and was decidedly unfriendly.The menu was enticing. Lots of unique and creative options. We settled on a Longhorn dog, poutine fries, and a bottle water. It's definitely not a cheap place to eat.Our order was ready within a reasonable amount of time. But they forget a key thing...flavor. The dog itself was bland. The bun was bland. The BBQ beef on to was bland. The cole slaw on top was actually disgusting. And the onion rings on top were poorly done. Even hungry, I couldn't force down more than a few small bites.The poutine fries were about what I would expect my 4-year nephew to create. It's a total sham to call them poutine fries. The fries themselves were decent. And then had a smattering of icky gravy and icky cheese. They were quite sad.In sum, quality and taste are lacking here. If it's a good hot dog you crave, there are better places on the Strip to satisfy your hunger need.
2	Open till 2:00 am for you drunkies or concert goers.  Maybe I was a little drunk, and I just left a concert, and I do love hot dogs... Just not Haute Doggerys.  They use a good dog, but they are steamed, not grilled, so they aren't getting maximum snap on their casings.  No bueno.  In addition, they are on the small side, and their chili is somewhat forgettable.  If you are just looking for something to soak up the alcohol then this might be your place, but don't come here looking for a gourmet dog experience.
1	There is little here that most people couldn't do in their own home. At the price I won't be back. Everything tasted,to me, canned and packaged.
2	Yuck. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the service was decent and it's possible that my wife and I just aren't into the dogs they serve here. It's was very expensive. Two dogs and a bottle of soda was $15. I get that it's the strip but the $1 foot longs you get from some of the casinos are way better. The dogs had crispy rubbery skin on them that was not even attached to the rest of the meat. The dog it self wasn't thicker than my index finger. Just yuck. If you're thinking quick cheap snack maybe just go somewhere else.
1	This place wont be here for long, their hot dogs are no better than what you could do at home. Actually hot dogs at Trader Joe's are exceptionally better so yes I could do better at home. It really isn't worth it and you have been warned.
4	I don't understand why the ratings for this place is below average because my boyfriend and I loved it when we came to try it out last night! I had the Gold Standard and he had the Rising Sun and we requested to have our buns grilled. AH, so good! We also ordered the crinkle cut fries and asked for garlic aioli and chili aioli on the side for dipping sauce for our fries and it was so yum!! Gah. - ask to have your buns grilled- try the aioli garlic and chili aioli sauces! The only thing I wish is for it to be a larger space because it's pretty compacted.Still, Love!! :)
4	I dont know why this place has such low ratings. I got the Raising Sun hot dog and it was delicious! My gf got the The Gold Standard and she really enjoyed it as well! the place is pretty small so you might have trouble getting a table. If im in the area i will defiantly will come back!
2	It's too expensive.I get it, it's located at the LINQ and "haute" is in it's name so $7 for a hot dog is to be expected. When I get hot dogs, I always have to compare it to Costco hot dogs because #1 it tastes great and #2 it's $1.50 including a drink. I ordered the Naked Kobe but the sausage was small and the flavor bland. Also the casing was a little bit chewy. My friend got the El Machete and they also didn't find the sausage amazing but they liked the toppings. For $6.49 vs $7.29, I think a gourmet hot dog will be a better deal (if you can call $7 hot dog a deal).
1	I was kinda craving a good hot dog so was excited to see this place within walking distance. Quite possibly the very worst hot dog experience ever. to boot, it's expensive.  so add insult to injury. This place claims to offer dogs from around the US that represent.   Well, if you are going to make that claim, then do it right. Start with the Chicago style dog was a joke. Not even served on a poppy seed bun, and they suggest using a steamed dog as opposed to a char grilled? It was a hoffy hot dog on wonder bread with the rest of the fixings. At least the peppers, pickle, tomato  onions were real. Menue claims beef is Kobe. I highly doubt that and why does a hot dog need to be kobe, anyway?  This place is merely a gimmick that doesn't hold up. Skip.
1	It was close to midnight when I arrived. I was pretty much the only person in there. Placed my order for an Empire Dog. Was sitting for 10 minutes when I guess a Manager said "how are you doing this evening sir?" My reply was "I'm waiting for my Empire Dog." All four of the people behind the counter looked at each other at the same time. Felt like I was in a sitcom.2 minutes later they called my order and "apologized for the delay." Yeah, the delay caused by their lack of attention to make a very simple hot dog. And for this I paid about $8 for the dog and a drink. And not exactly a decent dog either, very bland. Can get much better food throughout The Linq.
2	Last night, my friends and I had the amazing opportunity to see O.A.R. and Gogol Bordello for free! O.A.R. started the evening off right! Such a great show and full of energy, energy that built up my appetite. Between shows, my friends and I decided to walk the Linq and check out Haute Doggery for bite to eat. First off, when you hear the name Haute Doggery, you think gourmet. You think, wow, that's a cool spin to a hot dog. That's what originally caught our curiosity. Hot dogs are an American classic. When there's a spin like that, you can't help but walk in and try them out! Walking into the place, you notice the bright accents around the room. White table tops, wooden trimmings and bright red chairs. The focal point to the place is the hot dog artwork to the back of the room. I thought at first sight, this place looked awesome! Then it was time to order.THE BIGGEST, and I mean the biggest turn off for me are non engaged employees. When I walked up to the counter, the lady taking our order was texting on her cell phone! Clear as day, it looked like she was hiding from her coworkers, but didn't care about doing that in front of her customers. I took a picture and posted it onto the business page for proof. If you zoom into the picture, she wasn't texting anything professional. The conversation via text was about some drama. WHAT. A. TURN. OFF. That should NEVER happen. Unacceptable. She let me stand there for a good 30 seconds before saying something. When she did, she said, "Don't worry, I can hear you. Go ahead and order," WHILE SHE CONTINUED TO TEXT. Ugh, I'm sorry for the rant, I just felt cheap and unimportant at that moment. Not good for this business. That may be the reason why they just opened in the Linq and so far have an overall Yelp score of 2.5 stars. Aside from that, here's what I got for my meal:-Crinkle Cut French Fries for $3.99: the big disappointment with these fries that they weren't fresh cut fries. If the business is going to advertise themselves as a step up from the normal hot dog joint, well then I would expect them to have stellar, fresh cut ingredients. -Tijuana Dog for $7.29: When I did get the opportunity to talk with the hostess, I asked her between this dog and the Gold Standard dog (advertised on their business page on TheLinq.com. She told me hands down, this dog. This dog was bacon wrapped and deep fried, topped with grilled onions, jalapeno and mayo. The jalapenos weren't overly hot and coupled with the onions, it brought a nice crunchy texture. One of my favorite guilty pleasures is eating a hot dog with mayo. This was no different and super delicious! Although the hot dog was bacon wrapped, which I LOVED, the dog was super small. It had a nice snap to it, but unfortunately for me, it got lost in the mix of ingredients and wasn't the true star of the show. The word Haute means, "fashionably elegant or high-class," depicted by Websters. This place was inspired by the famous Holstein's menu and to me, a huge disappointment. I appreciate their overall take on the American classic. I really wished the experience was much better than what I saw, heard and tasted that day. For the strip, I would say the price is on point, however, not worth the return visit in my opinion.
4	First of all, cute painting and decors on the walls and ceiling! Conveniently located near the front entrance of the LINQ, the diner looks pretty clean.  Service is prompt.  The Billionaire Dog is a must-try!  $10.99 for a hot dog may seem a little steep but what I have put into my mouth is well worth the price tag!  Seriously, $10.99 is more than reasonable for a generous amount of Foie Gras torchon and port-wine onion marmalade on top of a grilled Kobe beef frank, with truffle mayo, inside a soft hot dog bun!  IT. IS. YUMMY!!
1	**Haute No More** HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!I'm rarely compelled to give a one star rating for various reasons, and unfortunately, this is one of those rare instances.The one star is given to the tempura avocado on The Rising Sun and the port onion marmalade on the Billionaire Dog. The place is decently clean with an inviting decor. I'll give credit where credit is due, and this is where it all ends.Our number was called roughly 20 minutes after we placed our orders, mind you that all we wanted were 2 dogs to fight off mid-afternoon cravings prior to our dinner reservation. As suggested by the time of the day, the place was not packed with people during normal dining hours, although there was a steady stream of foot traffic coming and going given that people tend to eat at any hour of the day in Vegas. I tend give new restaurants the benefit of the doubt because I understand that it takes time to grease the wheels back in the kitchen, and so I stayed optimistic. And perhaps, with wishful thinking on my part, that they were taking their time to make the dogs right. Unfortunately, one disappointment followed another from here on. Both franks were dry and bland. There's nothing special about the kobe frank that is to be desired over a regular dog. And based on the other comments, the regular dogs are not getting complimented much either. In the test kitchen, they may have tasted as good as they sound on the menu, but unfortunately, they were poorly executed here. There was no hint of truffle in the mayo, and so I asked for the Garlic aioli to bring it up just a notch.Now, this is the part where the story could have taken a turn, but instead, it sealed its fate.The lady behind the counter looked down at the receipt, then back up and said, "It's 50 cents. You can pay it at the register up front." Under normal circumstances, I would not have made a fuss had the menu (both in the store and the website as of the date this review is posted) not said that it was FREE!!! (You can verify this under photos that other customers have posted should they update the menu at a later time.) There were no fine prints indicated otherwise either. When I pointed out this fact, she repeated the answer using the I-can-care-less tone and gave me the you-are-wasting-my-time + leave-me-alone combo look. Strange, but true. No explanation. No apology. Just Attitude.It also left me wondering how many customers have been falsely charged for the condiments without knowing. Just to be clear, I'm not appalled at the fact that they're charging for condiments, but I am annoyed at the attitude in which the manner was handled, and the deceptive business operation this little incident is projecting. I cannot believe that a place of their potential would risk of categorizing itself under *****FALSE ADVERTISING***** over chump change, inadequate customer service, and poor management!!!!This is one of those rare instances where I would steer people away from a place even though I had a not-so-pleasant experience because I believe I visited a place on one of their "off" days. But after reviewing other comments (which is what I should have done before I got all excited about the mysterious power that Kobe and foie has over me), it seems to me that an abundance of "cold" disappointments are being served up at this supposedly "hot" joint.All in all, there is definitely no shortage of competition in Vegas, especially when it comes to eateries. I am curious to see how long the little Doggery door can stay open with the high lease and the streak of low ratings. Any guesses?
3	Stopped in before a concert at Brooklyn Bowl. Ordered the Big Fat Greek and an order of fries. The dog was delicious, but anything covered in feta appeals to me. Fries were ok, but nothing special. Price is a bit steep for what you get. They may as well not bother with a liquor license with the canned beer selection they have at $5 each. Walk a bit further and pay a little more for a draft pint at the Yardhouse. Small space, uncomfortable seats. Lots of room for improvement.
1	I should have gone to costco... At least I would have saved 4 bucks and gotten a drink with my dog. I was excited to try this place because everything else at the Linq has yet to have disappointed me, but unfortunately this place was the first. The dogs lacked the unity found in other hotdog places. Trying different types with the toppings didn't make the dogs taste any better but made them taste worse. They hot dogs they used didn't seem to work with the toppings they decided to pair them with.The service was a bit lack luster there was a general feeling of "I don't want to work here" and when I asked for an extra box to eat out of they gave me a used box that was sitting on the counter -.- not goodOverall an unsavory experience. P.s. The fries were okay.
3	Cool place but overpriced in my opinion. Kinda felt my stomach turn a little, paying $7-8 for a hotdog. Yeah it's fancy... But still just a hot dog. I got the Tijuana dog. It was bacon wrapped with onions and mayo. Pretty good but not that impressive. It was pretty busy when we came but the traffic flow is not too bad. The line to order is by the entrance and you get your food at the end of the bar. They have a decent amount of seating but it seems like most people take their dogs to go, to wander around the linq. The service is alright. They're not super involved with your dining experience. The place is run like a fast food joint. Order in one line and pick up in another. It was just meh. No one specifically stood out for poor or excellent service. I'd come here again, but only if I'm craving a hot dog and it's the only place open in the area.
2	Meh, meh & meh.....I'm just glad I didn't the $8-10 dogs!!!! Ordered a few dogs and was not impressed at all. The dogs they use just do not have a great texture or flavor! Ordered the poutine fries and they sucked as well! Not enough gravy, nor enough cheese curds.
1	So bad I had to review about it right away.. DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMENDED!I really had high hopes and was dying to try this place since it opened... I should've read the reviews and did a little more research but my eagerness got the best of me and I paid for it... $39 dollars of crappy food that is..Idea and concept is there but execution sucked! Presentation sucked! And service definitely sucked!First the prices for hotdogs, burgers and fries were up the ass.. Second, upon ordering our burger we had requested for the meat to be cooked "medium rare".. The cashier and so-called cook said "You know that's raw right?" I said, "What?!" Excuse me last time I checked medium rare meant the meat cooked but has a touch of red in the middle, not raw.. PLEASE EDUCATE YOUR COOKS & STAFF!! Looked at us like we were stupid... Third, when we received our food presentation was crap! Wasn't at all pretty and looked pretty damn ordinary to me considering we got the most expensive hot dog & burger... Now the taste.. There was no quality in the food! Was not worth the monies we spent! Hot dogs could've more than likely come from your local Albertsons, the foie gras was bland, cheap bread, the "Perfect Burger" was so ordinary, my first poutine was yet my worst poutine.. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY & SPACE AT THE LINQ-- will NOT be returning!
2	SOOO overpriced. The food is decent, but any spot that will charge $20+ for a burger and fries, but won't provide free tap water and tells you to "go next door to Starbucks to use the restroom and get water," will ALWAYS get 2 stars at most. Fuck these guys, go elsewhere. Its just really not worth the money AT ALL.
3	I didn't eat here, but my girlfriend ordered a hot dog at 10:58pm. They close at 11pm, and in my experience with places that you enter just minutes before closing, you are met by employees with a scowl. The employees at this place did not do that, which was really nice. The guy behind the counter was really nice to my girlfriend who is vegetarian and was looking for a veggie dog. He told her that any of the items on the menu could be turned into a veggie dog, which brought a smile to her face. She ordered a dog and two beers and it was ready in less than five minutes. She raved about the deliciousness of the dog and we enjoyed our beers right outside on one of the patios in the newly designed Linq area. For the rest of the trip she wanted to return for another veggie dog, so it's safe to say we will be going back again soon.
1	The food was like a 7-11 food and the price was $$$Would not RECOMMENDIf your a visitor you'd be better off taking a cab and go else where~
3	I don't have anything negative to say about this spot.  I know that it has been open for only a few months now but I have a feeling that things have been changed up a bit since their grand opening.  Prices are a bit high but I was not expecting anything less from a spot on the strip that is not only new but is also a part of the Linq.  I was intrigued because the toppings that are available are unlike the ones that you might find at an iconic spot like PINKS in LA.  The fries are nice and crispy, although also a bit pricey. I appreciated the attitude of those working there. They made some suggestions and also gave me ideas as to what toppings really complimented what items.  Personally, I really loved my dog.  I had a polish with grilled onion, guac, tomatoes and pepper jack cheese.  I know it doesn't sound like anything crazy but it was very filling, satisfying and just yummy to me.  You can't expect gourmet, even if they consider their spot a gourmet one.  It's a hotdog and burger spot.  Anyway, I enjoyed my food, didn't have any stomach issues afterwards and wanted to eat more fries even if my tummy was telling me that i couldn't handle any more. haha. I'd go back.
5	This place is GREAT. There are plenty of options in LINQ, but for a quick bite to hit the spot, come here.We came in minutes before closing, and got no flack from the staff. One star. I asked for a veggie dog and they told me anything on the menu could be a veggie dog. Two more stars. The food was quick, the beer was perfectly priced, and it was super convenient. One more star. Then...I tasted my haute hot dog treat. And there's not enough stars to go around.I got the Windy City dog. With its celery salt, neon green relish, perfect size and mouth warming goodness, it was EVERYTHING. I went to Berkeley (go bears!) and coming here was like coming home to Top Dog. I was in Haute Heaven.Stop by and try it. They close a little early for Vegas, but there's never a bad time for a dog.
2	Please know my two stars are definitely for service and not food. However, the importance of good service will always out weigh my desire for great food.I have never been to this place before and was very excited to go! I walked in and looked at the menu for a couple of minutes and instantly wanted to buy everything...it all looked so good. I ordered and when I went to pay I attempted to use a Visa gift card I had received for my birthday and the woman behind the register proceeded to tell me how she couldn't take it since it didn't have a name on it. I did explain it was a gift card and was accepted anywhere Visa was accepted. She just looked at me with a "meh" attitude and said they couldn't take it because of fraud issues. Oh, okay. I'll just take my business elsewhere since I am such a liability to your company. I didn't mind paying with my debit card, my credit card, or even cash, but I felt it was very rude the way she handled it. I certainly hope the food wasn't that great, because I have no plans of returning. I am huge fan of good service and good food. You can offer a great product, but when your service is anything less than average, I will just go somewhere else.
3	First day in Vegas! Obviously, I didn't want to eat that much before the party. So, my friends and I opted for something small and to share. It is not a great idea to eat something salty and fatty before fitting into out tight clothes, but we really wanted something cheap. Us 6 shared a hotdog, onion rings, and regular fries. The total was about $20? The hotdogs that we got was the Billionaire Dogs, which cost $10.99. It is a grilled Kobe beef frank, with Foie Gras torchon, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo. The hotdog was pretty good. The Foie Gras torchon aka liver, was kinda gross because I expected them to slice the liver thinly or even grind it into a pate style. Instead, they just put two blocks of yellow-color liver on top of the hot dog. The onion was really well marinated to the point it got sorta over powering. The truffle mayo looked gross to me, but my friends loved it. I only liked the Kobe beef and the buns haha. The beer battered onion rings were pretty darn good. It wasn't oily as I thought and the onion rings were perfect bite size. The fries were crunchy and not overly salted. Overall, it's a good place to come by if you don't want to spend too much at Pink's Hotdog. (Price is around the same but probably $1-2 cheaper).The downsize of this is that its located in an alley by the high rollers. I can tell that people will definitely miss this place and just go straight to Sprinkles cupcakes or Yardhouse. I know I almost did...
4	Was in Vegas for a Bachelor Party and ate here after a little morning drinking (no judging it is Vegas) and I really enjoyed it. Lots of different Hot Dog options. The staff was really helpful. We did not know what to get and the staff made great suggestions (Tijuana Dog and The Longhorn). I got The Longhorn (others in my group got the Tijuana Dog). It was a filling Hot Dog and a great value. I also got French Fries which were nice and crispy. It was very quick too if you are in a rush.I noticed that some reviewers commented on the price, which I think is off base. I paid $15 for a Hot Dog (with a good amount of toppings), a good amount of fries, and a water. I think that is a pretty good deal for Vegas. I paid more other places and got less food.
3	I didn't try the hotdogs but everyone said they were good. Fries were amazing. The place is just kinda small, which I guess you can expect for the location.
4	I see a lot of 1 and 2 star reviews, and I feel like saying to all of you, "That is what you get when you order foie gras on a HOT DOG!!" Some things just don't go together, like fat, and more fat. Anyway, I thought these dogs were pretty delicious! Between 3 of us, we had 5 dogs: The plain Jane- pretty basic dog, relish & mustard (and onion if you like)The Polish - with swiss and sauerkraut and even corned beef!The DC half smoke- another polish, but with chili and onions.The empire state dog- red sauce onions & mustardAnd of course the Windy City- do I need to explain?We also had some poutine fries and cheese fries. Everything was freakin' great!! Yeah a tad high priced, but that is expected in this location. I would be giving 5 stars, but the service majorly lacked. A bit confusing and small, so a little help would have been the cherry on top. If you are in the mood for a hot dog, this is a solid option on the strip, with plenty of people watching nearby.
1	Worst service and poutine in the universe.  The gravy tasted like onion and fuel - once I tasted it , I was glad that I could barely tell the difference between the poutine and the regular fries.  The kitchen also smelled and looked like it was on fire.  The entire place was filled with smoke for half the meal.  Skip this place for sure!
3	This place is pretty good. I got The Rising Sun which sounded more flavorful than it actually was...but don't get me wrong, it was still a pretty tasty hot dog. Most places in the Linq are expensive but i honestly would need to eat two hot dogs to feel satisfied and for about $10 a dog I cant seem to justify forking up about $20 just on decent dogs for one person when I could go to fukuburger and get something more fulfilling for cheaper.  I won't lie though, I do kind of want to try all the dogs at some point because they all sound very intriguing (and I'm such a sucker for hot dogs). BUT If you're in a hurry and want something satisfying and don't mind paying extra for a fancier hot dog than that in harrah's casino (theirs is 1.99, twice as long but not as thick and more simple) I'd suggest to go here.OH! and the $1 shrimp cocktail is pretty good for the price! I know it may sound skeptical but we didn't get sick eating it =p
2	Pros:- Food is okay. I had a dressed-up Polish sausage (after having been up-sold) with pastrami and other fix-ins that was pretty good, but my family had other items that they described only as okay.- Good location right off the strip.Cons:- Very expensive for what it is. Three people eating cost almost $30. For hot dogs, even fancier ones, that is too much.- THEY DO NOT SERVE TAP WATER! You have to pay for a bottle of water. Any place that does not offer paying customers a small drink of water automatically fails in my books (I think this actually happens a lot on the LV Strip).Overall: OK fare, but be prepared to pay a lot, and don't count on free water!
1	$10 for a hot dog.Granted, it is a solid hot dog.It's $10.  I can buy two steak and egg meals in vegas for that.Or lose it at the tables.Still, I'd rather lose it at the tables...  it's a just a hot dog!!! Nothing special about it!
2	fun atmosphere and A-C on a hot day.  The names and descriptions oversell the product.  Kind of expensive for what you get, but that seems to be the overall theme of the strip. Have to pay for bottled water, and the staff is a bit rude... like other venues, they seem to hate their lives and their jobs...
5	Granted we spent a good amount of money for lunch,  we got what we paid for.  Flavor was there,  service was fine, and prices are laid out so you know what you ate getting into. Personally,  we enjoyed it.  We did not opt for the kobe hot dog that runs about $10.
2	Talk about having mixed feelings!!! We walked in & were not even greeted. It was a little busy, but overall, nothing anyone can't handle. The cashier was an African American female and short in stature. Not only was she not friendly whatsoever, but was short and one worded with her responses. He asked her if it was a chain and she rudely said "it's just one!" As of we offended her. The reason why I gave it two stars is because my California Turkey dog was really good. My husband's perfect burger was not so perfect and the putini fries... Well my husband was the only one to try them and he only took two bites. No flavor and extremely soggy fries....So disappointing as I work nearby and was so excited for them to open!!!
3	Haute Doggery is exactly what I expected when I came across this small diggity-dawg emporium of weiners and burgers.  A menu that was limited but creative with hand-held food being the form of the day.     I had been in Las Vegas for a day so I was already coming down from sticker shock on foodies.  Looking up at the menu board in Haute Doggery didn't phase me.  All I was looking for was a hotdog of some kind to eat.   I settled for the Windy City hotdog that ran $6.95 and I wasn't disappointed.  The meaty tube steak was found amidst some little hot peppers, a few green peppers, a nice helping of slaw and a chipotle-like sauce.    Five bites and I was satiated.     The small little place isn't designed to seat very many nor comfortably.  After all, by God, the staff is preparing hotdogs.  You grab a dawg and walk it outdoors on the avenue of THE LINQ and people watch.  VEGAS baby!  Nuttin' wrong with downing a hotdog on the street for under a $10 spot.     For quick, tasty and easy..... Haute Doggery.
2	"Hotdogs are made out of pig buttholes," my dad told me when I was eight. Needless to say I didn't eat another for over a decade and we've had a tense relationship ever since. But thanks to the gourmet hotdog movement of 2004, I've ventured out to try them every few months or so.Enter Haute Doggery- located in the LINQ, touting Kobe-beef dogs with gourmet toppings. I opted for the Fun-ghi Dog, menu description: a char-grilled frank with grilled mushrooms, caramelized onions, truffle mayo and shredded Gruyere cheese.It arrived covered in cheese, which was fine with me since I love cheese. But I quickly discovered that the cheese was a blanket of deception, meant to hide the fact that my $9 hotdog had a scant four mushrooms on it and so few onions as to seem missing or forgotten.Oh, and I highly doubt that these are made with Kobe anything- and even if they are, their cooking method renders the quality of product useless. Listed on menu as grilled, it tasted boiled and lightly seared (which explains how it was ready in 3 minutes) and had ZERO snap. And the bun was unremarkable other than it being broken in two pieces before it reached my mouth. Pet peeve: receipt for walk-up restaurant has a tip line, but there is virtually no service provided. Even when there are only 3 people in the restaurant, order is called out when ready instead of walked out to the customer. Kind of tacky.
1	Not impressed,  I.love.hot.dogs! So I was excited to try this place,  cute name, nice lil spot, perfect location. I had the Tijuana dog and for the price I expected an all beef dog, it tasted like a cheap little frank and the bacon seemed to only be wrapped around the center of the dog = dissapointmentChili cheese fries were ok, but a small serving for the price. Customer service was about as bland as the hot dog.
3	I got the Gold Standard, he got the Longhorn. They were pricey dogs with minimal toppings. These are no Buldogis dogs...look it up and go there now and get one! You won't regret it. They were edible and satisfied our hunger but I wouldn't go any further. Las Vegas Pinks is below them, so they have something going for them. Staff was helpful and pleasant. We expected high prices...it's the strip.  I say skip it unless your a hot dog fiend.
5	Fast service, good basic food, & spotless!!!  It was late but the staff was cheerful & constantly wiping down everything so it was VERY clean. Not what I expected at midnight just off the Strip.
2	I didn't care for my hot dog, regular with sauerkraut but my husband liked his fried with bacon. The fries were good but overall 3 hot dogs, chili cheese fries and 1 soda was $30. Not worth it in my opinion.
5	Not sure why everyone is talking shit about this place. It's awesome.  We got 2 hot dogs and 2 burgers and they were really good. It was super packed and the food came out quick. Staff was awesome, especially for dealing with some wasted face people.  We'll be back.
3	Got the Tijuana dog, the shrimp cocktail ($0.99 when you purchase a dog), and the poutine... It was the first time trying poutine so not sure what to expect there... the shrimp cocktail had lots of the little shrimp and the Tijuana dog was not too bad. Quick service but the price is a bit high... but considering the location, probably reasonable.
3	They have a fun and diverse menu with some exciting ingrediates like sundried tomatoes and bacon wrapped dogs. However, my haute dog fell apart and for their prices I was expecting a higher quality product. The taste of the frank itself was very good and I think next time I would order just a plain one and maybe add some mustard instead of getting so fancy. The crinkle cut french fries were in desperate need for some seasoning salt. But after a day of drinking on the strip this was a quick and savory option.
3	Mediocre. Overpriced for the quality. I've been to better hot dog restaurants. Nothing special about this place. Walk a little further down the strip and go to pink's for great hot dogs!
4	Different hotdogs to try, the longhorn was great, good crunchy fries, and good poutine fries!! Would def come back!!
1	My boyfriend, myself and his cousin all got different overpriced  hot dogs with its special toppings at this establishment. That was fine. The ridiculous overpriced soda was ok too. I mean, it's Vegas and the place was located in the bustling new LINQ wanna be promenade thing. That's all gravy baby. I expected something similar to Dog Haus. But I was wrong. The hot dogs were kind of ridiculous. I guess I had a high expectation cause there were actually a lot of people inside. My fault, because I yelped only right after I ordered and sat down. The hot dogs were ok. Won't cry about it. The NOT so GOOD thing is the shrimp cocktail special.  NOT GOOD AT ALL. My boyfriend and I had a freaking stomach ache after eating it. His cousin was fine, because he didn't order one. But my bf and I were NOT ok. Horrible. And what sucked the most was the fact that we ate here for a quick bite before driving the long stretch back to LA. URGH. Never again. Ever.
4	It's a hot dog joint on the Strip. I'd guess $10/person is about right. It's a decent dog, virtually no wait, open long hours. Ideal spot to turn & burn. Is a $10 hot dog a lot; I guess, but we pay for convenience, and this is that.
3	Quick service, I had the California turkey...should have had a regular beef dog!  The fries are great!
2	I wanted to like this place but there are several issues.  First of all, they need to heat the buns and melt the cheese as mentioned in some other reviews.  Second, I really did dislike the fact they don't have a soda fountain.  Overall, the hot dogs were pretty good and there were interesting combinations but the hot dogs were kind of overpriced for what you got.  I will likely pass on this place in the future- I'd rather go to Yardhouse or something in terms of food.
4	Good food and friendly staff! A little bit pricy then other places but really fast and really good! 1$ shrimp cocktails if you buy a hot dog too!
1	Very pricey for what you get, and their burgers were burnt. Definitely not coming back.
4	Not sure about the others but I liked what I ordered. To some the prices may be steep but what do you expect when you're in Vegas on the strip. We got the The Fun-ghi and the Rising Sun. The Fun-ghi was de-LI-SHOUS!! The gruyere, mushrooms, and the creamy truffle mayo blended perfectly. The Rising Sun was good but didn't taste much of the teriyaki sauce but still worth a try.
2	Ate there last night with my partner and was pretty disappointed.  I had a hamburger and he had the hot dog.  As far as pricing, they are overpriced for what you get, a medium priced hamburger and a regular sized hot dog. The meat taste was fair, it was a fried burger and the bacon was ok but it was so greasy it felt like I needed to shave my tongue afterwards, no kidding!  The people sitting next to us kept looking at their food with a strange look like, 'what is this we just paid for!?'.  Their fries looked like bagged French fries with seasoned salt.Save your money and go to Carl's Jr.'s, better food for a much much better price.
2	Food is mediocre at best. Nothing spectacular, the staff looks pissed and not pleasant. They charge 59c for ranch dressing... Boo!!!
1	Terrible service. Did not honor the buy 2 get 1 free yelp check-in. Very disappointed.
1	I tried the Billionare dog, comes with Kobe beef dog and foie gras.  I must say, after the 3rd bits, I felt sick to my stomach.  The Foie gras felt cold and cheap, and the Kobe dog tasted like nothing more than a hot dog.  I'd rather eat Costco dogs for life than ever come back here.  The only thing good was the onion rings.  I still feel sick, and it's been over 5 hours. :(
