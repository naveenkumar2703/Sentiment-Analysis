3	Margiotta is more than just a local corner shop (although it is very near my house and situated on a corner...). It opens early in the morning, which is handy for picking up something to eat on the way to work, and it closes late at night, so handy for picking up a bottle of wine on the way home. They have fresh pastries (croissants and danishes), a nice selection of 'homemade' cakes (although I get the impression these were actually made in a factory somewhere and then wrapped in clingfilm to appear lovingly baked) and all manner of groceries that any shop situated on a corner should have (tins of beans, super noodles, tea, coffee etc). Plus loo roll for 99p. 'Nuff said.
3	This is another branch of Margiotta and I'm still a huge fan of them. Great for fresh bread in the morning, handy if you're in need of a magazine or the daily newspaper and great if you need a carry out for a party in the evening. This branch is clean, bright and well stocked with pretty much every necessity you would need from toilet rolls to a forgotten vegetable on the weekly shopping list.Whenever I've popped in the staff have always been friendly and they have a fabulous pick and mix range too!
