5	If you like raw oysters that are not small and have great flavoring and meat on them... This is the place... Order Louisiana Oysters and be prepared not to share... LOL... They have big flat screens to catch the game or great creole food to have lunch.. Don't forget to ask for the flat bread...amazing
3	I'm an oyster freak.  Yes, I'm talking about oysters, the food you actually eat and nothing else.  The thing is, I love oysters so I'm always looking for the best oysters in town.  I didn't like their oysters too much.  There seemed to be a very bad after taste to it.  My taste buds weren't too impressed.  For the price to pay, I wouldn't go back unless it's the last place where you can sit down and be served.
4	This place was amazing. I was there with my family  for the first time for dinner and the service was great, I had the oysters and they were delicious! As for my entree I had the Pan Roast with rice. It is to die for =) Im definately coming back again!
