5	At first, I was a little wary of the place because the exterior and interior look a little old, but after my cleaning, I'm really happy that I went here. The dentist and staff were all very nice, I feel like my teeth are VERY clean after leaving, and they offer a substantial discount for ASU students and staff. It was much better and much cheaper than any dentist I've been to since moving to Tempe. Highly recommended!
5	I went to this dentist's yesterday and had several fillings on my teeth. The whole process was comfortable and Dr. Acosta and his assistant were very nice and professional. So I went back and had a cleaning today. I like it because they do care about you, and they try their best to reduce your pain and worries. I highly recommend this place.
5	Wow! They're awesome here!  I felt so comfortable and at peace when I was in the office, the staff is super nice and friendly, which takes away from the nerves of going to the dentist. I don't have health insurance which made me afraid to go to the dentist, but Dr. Acosta was really awesome and gave me a great deal just to help me out. I found the dentist office that I will be going to for the rest of my time here in Arizona. I would highly recommend this office!
5	I happen to pay a visit to Dr. Acosta's office today. Due to my condition, I've been visiting numerous dental offices and I can clearly tell you that he is the top-notch dentist you are looking for. Not because he is benefiting all latest tech or fancy office materials, but because he makes you feel like he is on your side, he treats you with utmost respect and sense of humor and he is always giving that impression that stopping by his office was the best thing you have done for your health of mouth health.I definitely, without a doubt recommend Dr. Acosta for your visit.
