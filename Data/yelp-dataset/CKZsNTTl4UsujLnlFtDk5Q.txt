5	Dorota is THE bomb waxer!
1	Enzo used to do a good job, but then he got complacent and is no longer providing good service.  He put color on my roots and made me wait 1 hour before he pulled it through to the rest of my head.  Since he was running late he didn't have time to let it process on the rest of my hair.  I looked like a skunk with my part being a darker color than the rest of my hair.  He was rude when I asked him how much longer I would have to wait.  I think he's forgotten that he's in a customer service business.  I won't be going back and can no longer recommend him!!!
5	A dear friend recommended this salon to me, and I have been seeing Enzo for brazilian blowout hair treatments for over a year now. The shop itself is cute and has a nice atmosphere, but I really cannot say enough wonderful things about Enzo himself. Apart from his fantastic and thorough work, he is just simply a pleasure to spend a few hours with every 3 months or so. Great place to go and get pampered and enjoy yourself.
