3	Donuts ....not too bad if you are hungry . I prefer qt
3	Good price on gas.  Convenient location.  NOT a "food store."  Bring back the diet pepsi slurpee damnit.
1	I've gone here twice simply to put gas. The lady behind the counter needs training, a hearing aid, and a customer 101 class.I just needed gas. The first time I go there, the card doesnt work at the pump. I guess you always have to prepay your gas here??? So I go in and she rudely tells me "how" to use the credit card machine at the pump. MM hm. ok lady. Then I give her my card WITH my ID and it takes her two minutes to find my NAME on my ID. Really????So, I give her a dollar amount to run and finally, we're on our way.We drove all over the place so the next morning I needed another fill up.Again, the card thing doesnt work. I go back in to prepay my gas. I go back out to pump and NOTHING. It's not working. I'm like what the crap?!After freezing my butt off in the cold trying to get it to work I finally go back in and tell her its not working.She goes, didn't you say pump 3? I said NO, I SAID $30 ON 1. I'm the ONLY car out there!! She presses the issue and says again, I couldve sworn you said three. I yell back, NO. I SAID ONE! I grab my receipts (after she tells me to keep all my receipts, which flags me that she's probably done this MANY times) and run out the door fuming. What an idiot!
3	Standard convenience store. Cashier was okay - not friendly, but not grumpy either. Decent gas prices.
