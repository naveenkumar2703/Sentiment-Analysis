5	An incredible museum dedicated to Pinal Country.  It's worth seeing just for their gun collection.  Chris --one of their guides is the best!
5	I was honestly surprised by how many wonderful pieces and history this place had. I wasn't sure what to expect since Florence is a small town, but I believe that this museum is better than some in Phoenix.There were lots of really old, wonderful and odd things. One of the most unique of the pieces are the ropes that were used to hang people in Arizona. There is also a sock monkey from Winnie Ruth Judd. Don't be alarmed by my interest in darker items, there are also items of lighter subject - glasses that have turned purple from the sun, clothes, etc.One of my highly recommended Arizona stops.
