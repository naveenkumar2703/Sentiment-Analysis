5	When my husband and I went to see this florist to check them out for our wedding we were very happy with the service we got. The florist was very knowledgeable and friendly. Even though we gave him short notice, the bouquets were exactly what we wanted and everything was done perfectly. He has a great attention to detail and understood when I felt I needed to double check our order three different times. I would definitely recommend him and would use him again if the need ever comes up.
1	I think this place is closed.  I had a monthly order set for my grandmother, who turned 100 this year, to get flowers.   They closed down and stopped sending her flowers without ever telling me.  These people, whoever they are, wherever they may be, are complete jerks.
3	They were recommended by a florist in Glendale so I placed an order on-line for Mother's Day. I requested Friday delivery. Got a confirmation quickly. When the flowers weren't delivered on Friday I called - and called - and called. They apparently screwed up so many orders that rather than deal with the issues they just took their phone off the hook. The flowers were eventually delivered late Saturday - in time for Mother's Day, but still a day late. The flowers were, however, beautiful. Proceed with caution - especially on busy holidays.
