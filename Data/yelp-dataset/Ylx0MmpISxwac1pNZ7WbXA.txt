5	Too many contractor types are straight up shysters. They're messy, they're rude, they're sketchy, they're sloppy, they're not thorough. Artie is none of the above. He gave me a free estimate on some work, which came in significantly less than a competitor (like almost 50% less). During the job, he was punctual and friendly, and didn't attempt to pad up the bill with miscellaneous shit. He offered pretty solid advice on other issues we were planning to deal with ourselves down the road, never once implying that we wouldn't be able do to it ourselves. Also turns out he's even more than a plumber - he does all kinds of stuff (drywall, tile, on and on and on). Good to know! At the end of the transaction, my painfully fastidious and critical father (who had been circulating about, eagle eyes peeled for shortcuts or mistakes) specifically asked for Artie's card, which is kind of like being nominated for an Emmy or something in Dad-land. Woo! Two thumbs up.
5	Bottom line...Artie was great. We had to replace our shower in our master bath due to a bad install from the original contractor. The entire valve in the wall needed to be replaced. I called several larger plumbing services, and a few other contractors, but Artie was the one we selected. I called him, he came over that afternoon, and gave us a free estimate. His estimate wasn't over the top, and was quite a bit better than another competitor. As soon as he showed up at the house, you could tell he was a professional. He put shoe covers on before he came in the house. He talked me through what we needed to do, and he got it done. He is the type of plumber you want to work with. There are so many "shady" people out there, it's nice to know people care about their customers. Artie does. There is no doubt in my mind. If we ever have any other plumbing issues, I'll be calling Artie. He's our go to guy. I would highly recommend him to anyone!!
5	Artie is a class act. I have done service work (not much in the field, to be admittedly) and I absolutely appreciate the concern he had for the job and his approach throughout the work he did at my home. He is very thorough and very thoughtful about all the choices and work that he performed. He worked efficiently and the peace of mind I have now was well worth his reasonable service call.As a newer homeowner, I am collecting all the service people I use in the various areas of my home. Artie will be the only person I call for any plumbing needs.
5	One time, honest, and less than the original quote.  Artie replaced our shower valve, after I had opened the wall behind the shower to discover the job was bigger then I wanted to tackle.  I'd be happy to have him back again.
5	Great experience!  Artie was able to come out at 7:30pm to check out a leak at our rental at no extra charge.  Completed the repair first thing the next morning.  Would definitely call again!
5	We're impressed! Artie has done work for my Brother, my Father and for me.  We have all been extremely happy with his honesty,  integrity, and very reasonable prices.  After having three other plumbers at our home within the last year, he was a breath of fresh air with his wonderful customer service and great workmanship. I would recommed him to anyone.
5	Artie provided fantastic service! I called him to replace my broken and clogged garbage disposal and he did a fantastic job. He was prompt, professional, efficient, and reasonably priced. He made sure the repairs were finished completely, and got the job done quickly. I also enjoyed chatting with him. I highly recommend Arties Master Plumbing!
5	I highly recommend calling Artie.  His response time was quick, he was on time and very professional.  He work was efficient!  His prices were very reasonable as well!  Thanks Artie, I'll be calling you in the future!
5	Artie was great!  Quoted me over the phone, arrived the next day on time, spent 15 minutes in my house fixing the problem and cleaned up after himself.  Excellent service!
5	Artie is great.... if I had to make this a short story.We had a minor flood in our house because our under-sink RO system had a leak when we were trying to replace it.  Artie was nice enough to leave a current job to come help us with our issue at hand.  Since then, he's been back to fix a few other things, even down to installing our mister system! He was always very professional,and took the time to explain to us the things we needed to know.I really recommend him!!!
5	Artie service is above and beyond what you can find in the area. He saved us on a Sunday evening from a busted kitchen pipe and didn't even charge us extra for it being Sunday. He was super professional, very tidy, and integrous. I would recommend no other.
5	Artie came by Sunday and replaced my toilet and the water valve that goes with it, since both were broken and driving me crazy. He is super professional, and very nice. Quiet, and fast. I've had bad luck with plumbers in Arizona (usually loud and obnoxious and take forever to do things that should not take more than an hour), so I usually do my own work but the thought of doing a toilet replacement scared me, so I found him here on yelp and gave him a call. He answered his own phone, which I thought was really cool, and agreed to even pick up my new toilet at Home Depot. No fees for picking it up, just the cost of the toilet.He didn't charge a "service charge" like other plumbers. Just parts & labor, and since I was a new customer, he automatically included 10% off. Most places that I've dealt with, you have to tell them about the coupon you're going to use when you make an appointment, and then provide a hard copy of the coupon when you pay. If I ever have another task that requires a plumber, I will for sure give Artie a call. He seems to go above and beyond when it comes to customer service.
2	While I can't review actual work, I can review my initial impression from a first visit.  He responded quickly, but Artie dismissed my plumbing issue and recommended I get a shower curtain that suctions to the tub (at least the visit was free, so I didn't have to pay for that awesome advice).  I'm not just a dumb girl and I had considered that was the problem, but I had called him based on Yelp reviews after I realized it was a much bigger issue and simply felt like he didn't listen to my concerns - unfortunately for him because it indeed WAS a big issue and he missed out!  It took three plumbers until I found someone with enough knowledge and motivation to find and fix my issues.  I recommend DrainPro!
5	Last May, while moving, my younger brother busted a pipe when he disconnected the washing machine. Of course I was upset because moving is a pain in the a** anyway and now I had to deal with a repair.One call to Arties Master Plumbing and it was taken care quickly and at a reasonable price.  I highly recommend his services.  No bs here.  Professional, to the point and quick quality service.  I won't try to sell you something you don't need.
5	Artie came clear out to the west valley for me! He was a pleasure to deal with, and i will be asking him back to do a lot more work.
4	Called Artie at 7:30 am on Monday, he came out that day at 5 after his other jobs. Worked very hard to fix the clog in the pipe.  Very knowlegeable, and went above and beyond.  Stayed two hours, and even caulked around my wall so it would ruin the next time it leaks.  will definitely use again.
5	Artie is a very professional, very skilled plumber. He came by because my toilet is clogged, and I couldn't snake anything out myself. He tried snaking through the toilet, and let me know that there was some obstruction that wasn't letting his snake go where the water should be flowing, and was making the snake go up the wall through the vent. So he climbed up on my roof and snaked down the vent and found that he was able to unclog some things from there. He tested the toilet to make sure it flushed (it did!) and then started flushing down pieces of toilet paper to make sure (I definitely wouldn't have thought of that, and no plumbers I have worked with ever made sure in that way). This is how he found out that even a piece of toilet paper re-clogged the toilet. He said this was because of the obstruction from earlier, directed me to the Locator (video plumbing service) to see what was going on inside the pipe, and told me that it was probably due to an L where a Y should be, and that he could fix it right there, but wanted to save me the money in case it wasn't (it wasn't). The Locator came by and found out it was a piece of PVC pipe inside the pipe, so now we just need to figure that out. In summary, Artie:was on timewas politedid his jobreferred me to the right people when he was not able to give me a 100% answer / solutionis my new go-to plumber
5	Artie came to my newly purchased house this morning to replace an old garbage disposal and reroute a mess of complex piping under the kitchen sink because it had been done so poorly by a previous owner (or their plumber). He had asked me to buy the disposal before he came which I was happy to do since many plumbers will only get one through their supplier and mark up the price significantly. This helped to keep the cost minimal.Artie was prompt and courteous. He did incredible work (it's almost a work of art under the sink) and best of all, he was honest in his work and billing. He estimated a very fair price over the phone and he kept to his word. No hidden increases or pressure to consider more expensive work.Artie will be my go-to guy when it comes to plumbing.
5	Artie Rocks!Artie responded to my email almost immediately. He then set up time, for the next day, ( like who does that ??)  to review my problem. ( minor in the plumbing world but major to me)He called when he was en route to my house.  He was timely, neat, and very knowledgeable. He repaired problem quickly and treated me and my house with respect. The spigot in my backyard was replaced and as well as bathroom drain unclogged ( all within and hour.)The work was affordable. I would HIGHLY  recommend him. He is the real deal. Thanks Artie!
5	I can't say enough great things about Artie and Artie's Master Plumbing.  We called Artie on a Saturday afternoon.  He was at our house within twenty minutes.  Not only was he incredibly personable, but he is a fantastic plumber!  He worked through a job that had taken us about 5 hours (and failed) in about an hour, letting us ask questions and watch throughout the entire process.In addition, his pricing is fair and reasonable.  We liked him so much we gave him a tip!Whenever we have any issues in the future, we are going to call Artie!!!  I can't recommend him enough!
5	Artie responded to my message within 5 mins and proceeded to walk me through the repair.  After a few failed attempts I threw my hands up and asked Artie to come out to my house.  Based upon my schedule, Artie was able to schedule an appointment for 6:00 pm that night, which I appreciated. With most other plumbers I would have had to wait until the following day just to get a returned call.  Artie was punctual, polite, and cleaned up after himself. The price was right as well.  I have already given his contact info to a coworker who is in need of a good plumber.  I will definitely call Artie in the future.
5	He is fast, professional, and honest.  I would definitely reccommend him to anyone.  He does a great job and is reasonably priced.  He is extremely professional and he makes sure he does the job correctly.  He is also a very nice guy!
5	Artie came out on a Saturday night as a last minute water leak call.  He was incredibly nice, came to the property promptly and fixed the problem quickly.  Unfortunately, the place needed a new water heater and I had him come back a few days later to install a new one.  He did a fantastic job, charged a fair price and was very helpful with tips on how to maintain the water heater.  He went above and beyond to fix the problem and did it in a very stress free and professional way.I would not hesitate to use him again if I have any other plumbing needs.
5	There's a reason Arties Master Plumbing has all of these awesome reviews. Artie is truly a Master Plumber ! A true professional that can diagnose an issue, explain what the issue is, and fix it ! He was on time, courteous, and fair ! Artie is my plumber from here on out. I HIGHLY recommend...
5	Good guy - called Artie and asked for help ASAP for an inspection. Gave a thorough review and had the letter for me as promised within the hour. Will definitely call again if needed.
5	I was impressed, He didn't fix it, but he poured his soul into trying and did not charge me a dime. Unusually polite and professional. I will call him again in the future
5	Artie is a professional.  After dealing with a big-name competitor who tried to up-sell me and scare me into making repairs, I did some research and found Artie on Yelp.  His 5-star reputation led me to contact him via his website around 6pm on a Wednesday night. Less than 20 minutes later, Artie called me asking me to explain my situation.  I thought I had a slab leak, and Artie gave me suggestions and totally explained to me over the phone how to find the leak and isolate it.  He also gave me a recommendation for a company that could confirm if I had a leak.  Artie took the time to explain the entire situation to me, unlike the competitor that I had dealt with earlier in the day.Once the leak was located, I called Artie and he was able to come out the same day and give me an estimate.  There are no surprises with Artie.  He totally explains the situation and all of the options, and lets you decide on the course of action. There's no pressure and no attempts to get you to do more than what is needed or what you want to have done.Once Artie gave me the estimate, and we decided on the course of action, we scheduled the repair.  Artie came in and worked his butt off.  He is conscientious, respectful, clean, and efficient. His prices are EXTREMELY competitive. He even hauled away my old hot water heater, which he replaced at a much more fair price than any other estimates that I had researched.Artie's my first call if I have any other plumbing issues.  (He also took the time to provide some suggestions on how to fix a sprinkler issue that I have in my backyard.)Do yourself a favor and give Artie a try, if you haven't already, I don't think you will be disappointed!  I know that I am extremely pleased with his service.  Thanks, Artie!
5	Artie is our lifetime plumber!  He's great!  We've had him replace faucets, toilets, etc. & all the work he's done has been excellent.  Everything's working great & everything looks great!  On top of that, the bills we've received from him haven't had any surprises - his quotes were accurate.  I'd highly recommend Artie.  We'll use him for all of our plumbing needs.
5	I was having issues with my garbage disposal installation, two different handymen left in shame and frustration. Artie rolled up and threw that sucker in with ease and finesse. Truly the master plumber. He also reduced my agreed upon price due to the speed of his install.
5	As others have stated, Artie is a bona fide professional.  I was facing a calamity and he showed up late on a Friday without hesitation.  I loved the fact that he put on the booties and took great care in ensuring that he limited any mess during the removal of my reading chair (aka toilet.)  In the end, he didn't have the equipment necessary to complete the job, but he didn't charge me.  I have no doubt that if he had the equipment, he would have been able to help me.  Still, I will not hesitate to call him again when needed and neither should you.**Tip 1** He's got some great plumbing stories, so just ask.**Tip 2**Check out his website.  His great joy is custom work, so if you are in the market for a bathroom remodel, he may be your guy.
5	Not much can be said that hasn't already been said by the other 40 reviews. Artie is a good guy and runs his business right. He's clean, prompt, his pricing is extremely fair, and he does all the work himself. He's definitely the best plumber (of many) I've dealt with here in Phoenix.
1	Artie may be great at what he does as over reviewers dictate but lacks a certain professionalism unfortunately. I found Artie on Yelp with great reviews, spoke with him over the phone and described the extend of damage and the approved leak as per water company in units per hour. (The water company has taken almost a year to determine the specific leak. It's two quarts an hour from my copper water main.) After inviting him to the property he only quoted over the phone with no visuals.I specifically noted this detailed quote needed to be submitted to the insurance company. I received a loosely hand written quote that was labeled "pipe and cost". As to size of pipe and length, or allowing for multiple leaks, we will never know. After contacting Artie again detailing the insurance company would never pay on this over simplified proposal and I needed more detail I never heard from him again.  I requested a second quote to replace the shutoff value to the house from the water main line and that just never happened. So we never got to the "service" part of the process. Good luck getting there!
5	Artie came out to my house for a garbage disposal install that I couldn't get done myself for a few different reasons, he was courteous, kept my house clean, played with my cat, troubleshot my problem and charged me less than originally quoted. No complaints here.
5	I really want to write a 5-star review for Yelp, because that's where I found Artie! As a new homeowner, I've been using Yelp a lot to find the services I need. When I wasn't getting hot water in my master bath, I was terrified that I had purchased the Money Pit and so I turned to Yelp where I found the 5-Star Artie thanks to all of you other reviewers.Artie lived up to the hype. He came to my house and found out that we get hot water, just not as fast as we would like so he gave us an estimate for immediate hot water. Since he realized we were overwhelmed new homeowners, he didn't pressure us in any way to do the work right away and even encouraged us to wait a bit until we were ready. He was fast and understanding and didn't charge me a DIME to come out and help! Uh-maz-ing. I WILL be hiring him to provide immediate hot water once I'm settled in and I've got a new go-to plumber for life.Thanks Artie and Thanks Yelpers!
5	Needed a plumber late on a Saturday afternoon. Found Arties on Yelp!  Reviews on Point!  He's my Plumbing Kat from now on!
5	FIVE STARS FOR ARTIE!!The first time we called Artie was when we had a leak under our kitchen sink. I had turned to Yelp hoping I could find somebody with decent reviews. I was sold after all of his five star reviews and knew we had to try him out.To date he has installed a new kitchen sink, replaced a kitchen faucet and a bathroom faucet, and snaked our drain after a backup in our laundry room and kitchen. You better believe he's the first person I'll call when my next plumbing nightmare arises and he's the first person I'll refer my friends and family to as well.He is very professional, prompt, efficient, friendly, and reasonably priced! You really couldn't ask for more.
5	If you're stressing out about a plumbing issue - call Artie! He'll keep you calm and assured by his professionalism and obvious working knowledge & experience. We bought an old house with old pipes and we've had our fair share of issues.But with Artie to rely on, we're always confident with his skills and expertise. He art-fully solves all the issues while managing to keep us from fretting too much. And even though he works all over the valley from Gilbert to Glendale, he's always available when we need him. Artie - you truly are the Master!
5	I chose to go with Artie's after I had a leak under my kitchen sink, and a jacked up toilet tank in my guest bathroom. His 5-star reputation was impressive, and needless to say, he did not disappoint us at any point in the process.Artie was very quick to return calls, and always willing to work with our schedule, even though his was pretty booked up. He quickly fixed our kitchen sink leak without charging us...who does that?! I also had him look our other bathroom sink, which he fixed a small issue there without charge. Last task was that pesky flapper valve and wonky toilet tank, which he fixed in no time flat. Trust my review and all of Artie's other reviews...he's legit, very friendly, professional, and seemed to look out for his customers. If we ever have another plumbing issue, I'm going straight back to his Yelp page for his #. I'm glad I went with his service.
5	The only thing that makes me sad about Artie is that I didn't find him years ago.  Super professional, efficient, explained the problem and talked through some options.  In the end he got us up and running again for a ridiculously awesome price considering how sharp he was.
5	With a million kajillion 5 star reviews, Artie doesn't really need my help to boost his rep. But my experience was so positive, I just had to chime in. He's always super duper busy, and for good reason. However, he managed to squeeze me in, and patch up what I effed up, and for a reasonable price. Whether you need a leak fixed, or a whole bathroom remodel, Artie is your guy!
5	I own an old home in Tempe, built in 1967. I have been here for about 20 years and Artie is the best contractor, handyman, installer... you name it, that has ever been here.After three other plumbers failed to clean my drain he offered to come over at 8pm at the end of a day when he was already swamped with work.  He got it done, and his price was beyond reasonable compared to the other guys who diagnosed  the problem incorrectly and wanted to dig up my backyard and charge me ridiculous amounts of money to do so.Going the extra mile is obviously how Artie operates from day to day., and writing this review is the least I can do to recognize the extra hard work he did for me.  THANKS ARTIE!!
5	Learned about Artie off of Yelp - he was fantastic! We just moved into a pre-foreclosure house where someone had put the gas line hookup 6 inches from the wall. I saw his fantastic rating off of Yelp and he was able to shorten the gas line within minutes. He was professional, knowledgeable and friendly, and was able to squeeze us into that day. He is very busy, but glad he was able to help us out - we were at our wits end with that gas line! Would highly recommend him. As its hard to find someone honest and reasonable to help out with stuff we have no clue about, he was both. Thank you fellow Yelpers, he was awesome! Definitely will call him again if we get into a bind!
5	I hate to say I am happy I had a leaky toilet - but I am! Artie answered his phone - it did not go to voicemail like the others I called (this was on a Sunday morning) - and let me know when he could get there. He also tried to talk me through some quick fixes that might work , it wasn't all about the money for him, and that was impressive. Well those did not work, and he gave me a window when he could be here. He called when he was on his way, showed up when he said he would and wiped up the floor when he was done! He did not just DO the work - he did AWESOME work! - which I would love at any price - but his prices were beyond reasonable!So while it stinks that I had the leak - it is fantastic that I found a plumber I feel like I can trust  for other work I will need to have done.That  - and he and his son couldn't have been nicer people!
5	On a whim I started remodeling our shower, knowing full well that I wasn't going to mess with the plumbing.  I had used Artie in the past, with excellent results, and decided to give him a call back.  He was able to fit me in early and switched out my mixer valve in fairly short order.  Since I had already ripped down everything, he charged less than he had quoted over the phone.  He was even kind enough to give me a few (very appreciated) pointers about caulking and hanging drywall.
5	What to say about Artie that hasn't been said already.... Pretty much he is the most customer service oriented person I have ever met in my life.  This past July, (yeah, I know it's a really, really late review, sorry Artie), my folk's water heater finally bit the dust and died a horrible, messy, rusty, flood-death all over the inside of the garage.It was July 2nd.  I researched and found Artie and gave him a call to see if he could maybe squeeze me in before the holiday, but alas, he was booked.  Instead, however, he offered to show up ON THE FOURTH OF JULY - at normal rates.  Unbelievable.  I was so impressed and amazed at his dedication and service.  He is the salt of the earth and one of the nicest guys you will ever meet.  He cares about your home's interior and absolutely will not leave behind a mess for the customer to clean up - ever.Bottom line, if you can catch him, he is the ONLY guy you ever need to call.Thanks a ton Artie for helping out my parents in a very difficult time.  You have a customer for life.
5	It took an extraordinary experience to take me off Yelp hiatus.  Thank you, Artie, for providing that experience.  Thank you also for ending my search for a highly skilled and principled local tradesman.  As the new owner of a home that is quite literally falling down around me, I am well acquainted with the Phoenix trade scene.  I have enjoyed the company of several apathetic and taciturn dudes who pretty much just go through the motions, reserving their greatest enthusiasm for taking my cash.  Artie couldn't be more different from these guys.  He has come to the future from a bygone era when tradesmen genuinely cared about integrity and quality work.  Just call him right now.  You will not find a more legit guy.  In case you are really uptight and need more convincing: I called on a Saturday afternoon.  Artie maneuvered me into his schedule and was at my house within an hour.  He spent about 90 minutes diagnosing a real head-scratcher of a problem with what I now know is a defectively installed shower.  He never once sat back and just scratched his head.  He worked creatively and tirelessly to exhaust every potential source of the problem (water intrusion into the wall) and eventually nailed it.  His son Daniel helped and was a real professional. Better yet, Artie explained everything along the way.  He volunteered options and alternatives.  He graciously entertained dumb questions and provided clear answers.  As a courtesy, he removed a clog from the shower drain that probably could have made decent wig (which was completely outside of the scope of my call).  When he left, I felt confident that I understood the problem and the plan for solving it.  You can Artie will be carrying out that plan,  and solving the other inevitable problems with my money pit.
3	Pretty disappointed. After having such a fantastic first experience with Artie, he was the first person that I wanted to call when I needed a plumber. Yesterday, on 12/12/12, I called four times over the span of 6 hours and left 2 messages. the second message expressing the urgency of me needing him to call me back. 6/2/13 - Edit. I haven't been on YELP for several months. Probably since the time of the original post. I did get a VM from Artie a couple days after the original message (By that time I had found another plumber so I didn't bother to call back). Further, I got a message here on Yelp explaining that he was really sick with a fever that day. When you are a small business owner, and worse, a one man shop, I can understand how you can never have sick days or days off. I still think Artie needs to find a way to respond in a timely manner, especially when I mentioned how urgent it was. I will revise my rating from 1 back to 3 since he did get back and explain to me the situation. I will still stand that my original experience with him was great.
5	AS I EXPECTED, since I own a 40 year old home, I hard to call Artie in an emergency AGAIN.I called him at 1am and left a message.  I had sewage backing up in my downstairs bathroom!  He called me back at 8am Sunday morning and was at my place by 9:15am.  Things were fixed and cleaned up by 10:30am.  He fixed the original issue I called about AND repaired a part that would become an issue in the future (and didn't charge any more than his phone quote)!It was supposed to be his day off and he had promised Mrs. Artie he wouldn't work on Sunday anymore...  But, as he said, when you work for yourself its hard to take days off.Thank you Artie for the wonderful service and I hope Mrs Artie wasn't too upset!
5	I don't typically write reviews.  I have to be honest, I rely on everyone's hard work in writing theirs and reap the benefits of all of your great advice and experiences. Not today - time to pay back and I'm so happy to write one for Artie - on my own accord, too!If you need a plumber - USE HIM!  He's honest, fairly priced (seriously, I had a MAJOR under the slab leak and another well-respected and honest plumber who also bidded the job was floored at his great pricing), is clean, prompt and does excellent patch work for drywall.  This is hard to find in a plumber and is typically outsourced.  I was very pleased.  He told me the job may take 10 hours and given I had an emergency situation, he moved his schedule around to be sure I was taken care of.  He got the tricky job done five hours earlier than he had originally quoted so I was definitely under-promised and over-delivered!  Happy camper here!  He runs a one-man show so don't be surprised when he picks up the phone.  Also, worth noting is how easy he is to get a hold of.  Yet, another positive aspect of doing business with Artie!
5	I had an emergency leak in a pipe outside when it got cold last month, and called Artie. He was really busy because everyone was having this issue, but came by as quickly as he could (less than an hour) and fixed it up really quickly. He also showed me how to turn off the water so that I don't get a really high water bill if something like that ever happens again.Again, he is incredibly polite, efficient, and  had a great price especially for an emergency. I definitely recommend him.
5	I am in the middle of a bathroom remodel, and I had Artie come out to install the new tub and plumbing.  The drain had to be moved a couple inches, and I had him install the new valve while he was at it.  The job was done quickly, looks great, and he even took the time to point out some things that I might have otherwise overlooked with the rest of my project. All in all, I don't think you can ask for much more.  I will definitely use him again when I get started on my other bathroom.
5	After having a couple plumbing companies come out to give me a quote for several repairs needed at the house that all rang in close to $1k, I happened to see the Yelp review on Artie, and decided to give him a call.  He returned my message quickly, showed up within a few hours, and proceeded to fix the issues for 1/5th of what the others quoted!!  He's incredibly knowledgeable, super courteous, and a great guy.  He explained what was wrong, how he would fix it, and did... quickly!!!  He made an appointment to return a week later to fix a few more items that he couldn't get to because of required parts he didn't have with him at the time.  If you have any plumbing issues, call Artie!!!  He's AWESOME!!!!  YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. And tell Roto Rooter to stick it where the sun doesn't shine.  Bunch of con artists.
5	I'm late getting this review written, but I was not about to forget about it.Artie came to our house to...let's just say help my husband finish installing a leaking bathroom faucet that we had tried to replace. Artie was right on time and even wore booties over his feet to keep our floor clean. My first impression was YAY! Someone who cares about cleanliness. He took the time to answer my husband's questions, explain what we did wrong, could have done differently, and why certain things were important. Initially, Artie thought it would be a quick fix. He was in and out, and, when he left, nothing was leaking. Unfortunately, our home is a little old, and the faucet had its own agenda. The leak started up again. We called Artie and he was quick to offer times he could come over to take another look. The second time, Artie was on a mission. He was in and out quicker than he was the first time and replaced some pieces to ensure we never had a leak. Once done, he bid us good evening and absolutely refused money. Oh my! Someone with work ethic?!?! I about fainted. It's been weeks and not a single drop of water has leaked.I HIGHLY recommend Artie to anyone looking for a plumber. I know I'll never use anyone else.Thanks Artie!!
5	Finally found a plumber I can trust!Price was better than the estimate plus he gave us his 10% new customer discount without us saying anything about it.Gave us a courtesy call when he was 10 minutes away and was 10 minutes early. Squeezed us in on the same day; thank God since we didn't have any water for the house! Fair, reasonable and polite. His 2 man crew finished the job quickly and with comfortable and pleasant interaction and conversation.Will DEFINITELY look to use Artie's services again! And, we scored an awesome new pen.
5	Artie just left, after having replaced my leaky garbage disposal and taking a crack at my clogged bathroom sink. He is top-notch in speed, quality (so far), and cleanliness. Plus, he was a generally nice guy that I felt comfortable having in my house.I had suspected that the disposal was the problem when I called, so I asked if I should buy one in advance just in case. He told me exactly what other parts I needed to get (who knew they don't come with power cords?), so the job went quickly and easily.He also tried to get to a clog in my rear bathroom sink. His snaking tools couldn't go beyond a bend deep in the wall to get to the clog. He was extremely nice and gave me advice about next steps, including a way to find a trustworthy service company to do the advanced rooting work.I have no regrets calling Artie. His pricing was reasonable ($70 for the work, done in an hour), he was very professional. I'd call him again and definitely recommend him to friends.
5	I called Artie for a leak in a rental unit that I own.  He made an appointment on Saturday evening as he was booked all during the week.  He called as he was getting ready to come to the property and arrived at the appointed time.  Not only did he do a great job getting to and fixing the leak but he is extremely consciences, wore booties to cover his shoes when walking on the carpet and left with everything cleaned up.  The work also required some drywall to be fixed and he was able to do that at the same time.  Oh...and by the way, he is very reasonable.  We will definitely use him again when needed and recommend him to others.
5	Artie get's my business from here out.  Amazing speed and efficiency in getting a leaky disposal fixed that had caused a serious mold issue under my kitchen sink.  He was very straightforward and you know when you are dealing with an honest person.  His prices are good as is his level of professionalism.  He even wore shoe covers before entering the house which is not something I have seen in a long time.  Thanks Artie for fixing our issue and the great service.
5	Artie came to fix a leak that we had under our guest sink. After trying to repair the sink myself, unsuccessfully, I called Artie based on his reviews on Yelp.He returned my call quickly and was able to come the next day to repair the sink. He was neat, cleaned up after himself, and carried on a pleasant conversation while working. He was very patient with his apprentice who retrieved the wrong tool from the truck.He was able to fix our sink within about 30 minutes and charged a fair price. I would highly recommend him and will keep his number in case we have a need for a plumber again, which I'm sure we will at some point!!!
1	I called to make an appointment to fix a leaky spigot. Left a voicemail (no outgoing message), and have not received a repsonse 24 hours later. I understand this is a small business, but if you offer 24/7 emergency service, you should be able to at least call potential customers back quickly.
5	Normally I'd do most plumbing repair myself. This time I was over my head. I'd already replaced the fill valve, flex tubing, and 1/4 turn shutoff valve in my 2nd bathroom. Everything looked great. Then I found a very slow leak at the shutoff valve. The leak was at the wall side of the nut that held the 1/2" copper tubing to the shutoff valve. I removed the valve, cut the copper tubing that extended beyond the compression ferrule on the copper tubing because it was too long for the new valve. When I tightened the nut back down everything looked good. After an hour I saw that it was still leaking. I tightened the nut more and the effort was too low. The nut cracked and the leak increased. I had no idea how I was going to replace the nut without removing the ferrule, so off to my local Big Box store. They understood the problem, but couldn't offer a tool to remove the ferrule and indicated that a plumber would probably have to cut the wall, cut off the copper tube and ferrule, sweat on a couple of copper parts, etc.  I found Arties Master Plumbing on Yelp and thought that if all the reviews were true I couldn't do any better. I called Arties and it was my lucky day. He was here within 1 hour, fixed the problem in about 15 minutes without all the bad stuff I expected, and charged a fair price.I will recommend him to my daughter and anybody else that needs a plumber.
5	We had broken sprinklers in the side yard and had them fixed, but still had puddles with H20 running down the side of the foundation. Water was coming in the kitchen/family room under the baseboards. I spent a week washing and drying towels.Artie was wonderful. Very professional, neat in appearance. Diagnosed and fixed the problem quickly. Broken pipe in exterior wall and plugged drain from kitchen sink. Explained everything to us. Was very honest and ethical. He even helped us with our fridge H20 filter as he was leaving. I'd have no problem having Artie do any remodels, etc. He truely is a Master plumber.
5	Yup, if you need a plumber, Artie is your guy. Might be hard to book nowadays. His YELP profile has totally blown up!When you call him expect him to be pretty busy. When he arrives be prepared for a heavy east coast accent and a mullet. Bonus: High-waisted pants and a belt.Super nice, helpful and friendly. Plan your plumbing disasters accordingly.
4	Very happy with the work and service, Artie is straight forward and does excellent work.
5	I think this guy is hands-down the best contractor I have ever hired to fix anything!  All of the five-star reviews are justified.  He just finished putting in a custom tile shower at my house...I called him to fix a leak, but when I realized his prices were so competitive I went ahead and replaced my leaking fiberglass shower with a new tile shower and I couldn't be happier.  He did a FANTASTIC job...I will definitely call him again to remodel the remaining two bathrooms.  He is very knowledgeable and does amazing work...a true professional and craftsman!
5	Can you give 10 stars? No? OK, just double my 5 then.This guy is awesome. I've had some bad experiences with tradesmen in the past and when I needed a plumber I was a bit anxious. I trusted the yelp reviews and called Artie and I'm certainly happy I did.He's knowledgeable, honest, efficient, punctual and does quality work. There are more accolades I can throw at him but you get the idea - I like this guy!I called him to fix/replace a mess that a previous owner did on the outside of the house. For reasons known only to him, he used galvanized pipe to feed the irrigation valves. Well, it sprung a leak and the way it was tied into the house shutoff, sprinkler system, pressure regulator, backflow and spigot meant the whole thing had to be taken apart. Artie to the rescue! It's all copper and brass now and it looks nice; actually when I had the house painted recently I told them not to paint the plumbing - it looks that good!Highly recommended.
5	The best. After another plumber (highly recommended on Yelp) came over and spent 10 minutes trying to unplug a drain, I called Artie. He came right away, from another gig. He figured out he would need to try and drop the snake down a pipe at a T Junction. He fished for 30 minutes, and finally got it to drop. He unclogged the sink, and gave me a price that was $40 less than the other guy. And did he bolt, after the job even though it was in the evening? No, he stayed, cleaned up, and gave me tips on avoiding future clogs. Don't waste your time or money, go with Artie.
5	Artie swung by when I was in a jam, promptly fixed the problem, and was incredibly professional. He's fantastic!
1	Definitely not a master at returning phone calls.
5	Once again...  my 45+ year old house sprung a leak and I called Artie immediately.  I was so thankful he was able to fit me in to his very busy day of saving homeowners from doomed plumbing.This time my upstairs shower was leaking into my downstairs ceiling.  OY!  Artie and his assistant Alex did some troubleshooting to find the leak.  When he figured it out, he showed me where the issue was. 10 minutes later he had the problem solved.Coincidentally, I had also scheduled an Air Conditioning service call for the next day due to what I thought was water from the AC in my air ducts in another part of my house.  Artie saw the mess and asked about it.  Immediately he identified the water line to my fridge as possibly being the issue.  He crawled up in my attic and found that yes, the fridge water line had sprung a very small leak up there.  He quickly fixed that as well.  I'm beyond happy about Artie's help today!!Once again, I felt his price was extremely fair.Hoping that next time I have to call Artie it will be for my bathroom remodel!
5	Artie was in and out quickly at a good price and was willing to work with our schedule.  Great dude, great service.
5	Like probably most people on here, we found Artie on Yelp. I was specifically looking for a gas plumber and that is one of his specialties. Since my wife and I have almost completely redone our house I have learned a lot about working with contractors and when they ask you a lot of questions, that is a good sign. Artie asked a lot of questions and almost turned down the job but after discovering a gas line in the ceiling we were good to go to get our new gas cook top installed in the kitchen!Artie gave advice on what we should be doing when building our kitchen peninsula which was very helpful and prevented me from missing some major details I would have not been aware of.  I called Artie back for helping put in a water line to the fridge and hooking up a new gas dryer too. Back to Artie nearly turning down this job, he ended up turning down my drain cleaning job but that is a-okay because he was up front and honest and not trying to make an attempt and know it won't do the proper job. I don't think I will have any projects for a while that require his work but I know when it comes time to remodel the bathrooms I will be working with him again in the future!
5	A few months ago we decided we were going to remodel our master bathroom. Using Angie's List as a resource I had three contractors give me an estimate. While I'm sure any of them could have done the job I just didn't feel 100% confident in any of them. I remembered that Artie told me that he did that sort of thing so I gave him a call. Artie came out and was the only contractor who noticed that there was some separation around a glass block window and something looked wrong under the tub deck (more on this later).  He also asked questions that I hadn't considered and was happy to discuss various design ideas. He had a helper on hand for most of the project but Artie was always on site - it's not like you hire Artie and things get subcontracted - Artie does it all.  When the demo was done we found that there was a considerable amount of dry rot under an existing large glass block window.  The project came to a halt because Artie had to remove the glass block window and quite a bit of the framing and stucco and then rebuild everything including the installation of a new window.  Artie built a new tub deck, moved the drain, re-plumbed the faucet, installed a new air tub, built a new shower with a bench and tiled (travertine) the entire area. I've added a picture of the finished bathroom.Artie did a fantastic job and we couldn't be happier. His attention to detail and doing a quality job is evident when you see him work and the finished job.  The remodel took about a week longer than estimated because of the window which was expected. Artie is a pro - I believe I'm quoting him when I say, "there are trademen and there are craftsmen" - Artie is a craftsman!
