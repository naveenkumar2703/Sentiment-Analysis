4	I don't really remember why, but I got a good vibe coming here, even though it was just for an oil change at the time.  They recommended that I change out my serpentine belt as it was showing cracks.  I really appreciated that they alerted me to this issue in a way that was confidence-inspiring, without a hard-sell to replace it there.  They brought my car around to the front of the building and overall seemed very professional and service-oriented, which is sadly rare these days.  Four stars, and I'll be coming here for the ol' oil change from now on.
5	I had five kids with me when I pulled in here.  The place was clean, the guys were attentive to the kids safety and needs.   I felt like I got the royal treatment!  Curtious, friendly and professional.  Adam, Anthony and Dave are the best!  Oh!  And it's an automotive place-not daycare!   I'll be sending my girlfriends here...customer service is worth a 5 star.
4	I came here on a Sunday and was expecting to have to wait all day to get my oil change.  Thankfully this wasn't the case.I came in with a coupon- waited 15 minutes- and was on my way.  They didn't try to pressure me to get the expensive oil or sell me on getting additional (and costly) services which I appreciated.I'll be back.
2	Since I was in a corporate vehicle they figured they could charge whatever they wanted without asking for driver approval! The card has a 200 max without calling corp so they just added stuff without asking me.
5	I can't tell you how much of a great experience it was getting my oil changed here...they got my car in quickly and went over everything with, never pushing any service. I had noticed my battery was weak and the manager brought that up and gave me the info needed to get it replaced because it was under warranty! They completed the service super fast! Very pleased and will definitely use this location again!
5	Great service and fast. The Assistant Mngr Anthony took great care of my wife's car and provided a great customer experience. He didn't try to push things on me.
5	I got my oil changed and a battery replaced there yesterday. The service was fast, and friendly as always. The thing that stood out most was an employee named David that remembered my name from 8 months ago when I got my last oil change from them. That was pretty impressive.
5	They're so so so nice here, and they don't give off scam vibes like a lot of mechanic places do. Anthony is super nice and polite and there was this main mechanic dude who was very informative. I'd come back for sure.
