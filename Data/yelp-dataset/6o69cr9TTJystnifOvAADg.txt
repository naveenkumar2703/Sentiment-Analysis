2	The food here is great but I recently had a slip up but other than that its delicious! The atmosphere feels like an old hotel from up north service is OK but needs improvement
3	The service was okay. The food menu is limited to a few things. I felt as if I might as well had stayed home and cooked. The food was hot and tasty though. I had my kids with me but it seemed to be mostly for older men who play golf.
