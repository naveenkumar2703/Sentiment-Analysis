3	This Terrible Herbst location is similar to most of their gas stations. It is kept relatively clean as gas stations go and they always have a good selection of snacks, drinks and beer. The gas prices aren't ever the cheapest in town, but they are always reasonable. There is a self-serve car wash at this Terrible's and you can get a free wash with a gas purchase just be sure to bring your own towels.
3	Very close to W Charleston campus of CSN. Very convenient location. Pricing of gas is relatively same as any other gas station in the area. Thank goodness for Techron.
4	Gas are always clean, soda machines always work, good variety of snacks, and the always have Reese's Pieces.
