2	Ewww... another label bites the dust. They have low quality cheap clothing made specially for their outlet stores... Occasionally you might find a hand me down that didn't get sold from their regular Guess store but the majority of the stuff here is a step down from their normal stuff. Not worth your time. But if it is hot enough, definitely worth your time in the store... they REALLY blast the AC.
3	Although I am not real impressed with their clothing items, I have to admit that it's about more than just the merchandise to me. It's about a whole experience. I enjoyed my shopping experience here because of the awesome, friendly service.  The staff were friendly and the store was kept clean. The floors and racks were clear of any clutter.  Hangers weren't lying on the floor like in past visits. The displays were in order, clothing sized, tags tucked in, etc.  But, like I said before, the clothes just don't cut it. There are a lot of basics that get sold here. And, for me, I really don't see what the point is to pay top dollar for the basics if I can get them at the outlets at a discounted price.
4	it's an outlet. better than no discount, right?
1	They refused to return a defect product even when I have the receipt on me, because they can't put it back on floor
