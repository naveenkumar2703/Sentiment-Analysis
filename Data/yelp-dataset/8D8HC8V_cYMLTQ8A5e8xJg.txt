5	My new neighborhood Convenience StoreSo we we needed to stop by & get juice before our morning commute. We were greeted with a friendly "Good-morning" right away.The place had a few customers - not too busy....Music was also playing at a refreshing level. Of course my daughter had a specific drink in mind "Bug Juice", we settled for the more popular selection available. While walking to the front, again another employee said Good-morning,  Up to the counter we go and AGAIN the man said "good-morning" Talk about feelin' the love.... They not only had the usual they also had a small gift/knick-knack section.... I will continue to support this small neighborhood store.  I can tell they value their customers. For that alone is worth YELPing about!!!!
5	This store rocks! They have EVERYTHING there. The best thing is that they always have some kind of deal going on for beer. You can get it dirt cheap. I remember for a while we were buying 12 packs of coronas in cans for $5.99. I'm telling you this is the place to be. They have cheap sodas, and they even sell hats. They have all kinds of souveneirs and everything. They even have machines if you want to stop and play a little. The thing you really can't beat is the service you get. The employees are awesome. They're funny, cool, and nice. What else could you ask for?
