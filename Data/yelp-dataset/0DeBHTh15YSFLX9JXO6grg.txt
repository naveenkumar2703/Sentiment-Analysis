5	hee hee. this place happens to be right next door to Palo Verde, and was the closes liquor store to me for two years.Sam is a pretty fun guy, and i'm pretty sure he only understood about half of what me and my drunken roommates were asking for when we'd inevitably make the trek up there for more booze.they have a small selection of just about everything you would want, about as much as a circle K, and about five shelves of red wine. i think he's open til about midnight or one on the weekends.
4	Good local owned business, small on the inside but seems to be able to cram a lot of liquor in that store.
1	Very rude!
