1	Up all night partying; I decided to go shoe shopping at Zappos in Henderson.  I still was mildly drunk from the previous nights escapades.  This left me more agreeable than usual; for when asked where I would like to try and find something to eat at 10 am in this strange end of town I wasn't too bossy.  I simply stared back at my cohort from behind my oversized sunglassed and muttered something like "I'dunt cur."  This is how I ended up in a restaurant full of people that looked like they were going coffin shopping after lunch....             @  @ @          @  ^O-O-   @          @       U      @             @   ---    @                   \     /             ~~  (   )  ~~           /         \ /            \           l    l           I   \    \          /    /            \    I    \        /     /(             )   I    I       mm   l          l     mm       I     l   lIIIIIIIIIIl     I    I       l~~l--l--------l----I---I                    I     l   l    I     l      I    I       I ```I   l    I     l      I```I       I     l   I_  I _ l      I    I       h    l    V    V       h   I            (O)                     (O)Which would have been okay if our waitress wasn't some sort of fire breathing menopausal demoness.  She slammed down my bowl of beef barley soup so hard I thought the bowl was going to break in half.  I asked for extra mushrooms on my sandwich so I got no mushrooms.  We sat with empty drinks for a while during our meal.  It sucked.  Hard.
3	Service was good. Today I had the buffalo chicken salad. Great choice for a wedge salad with good portion and great varied tastes with the blue cheese and ranch.Prices are reasonable. Good lunch spot and can get breakfast anytime is great.
5	They have done a total make-over on this place. I came here a few years ago the food was so-so but now they have a new menu and the food is great!  The BBQ ribs are delicious and you get a whole rack for $12.99 - enough for 2 people, or dinner and lunch the next day!   Pretty much everything on the menu is good, my favorites would have to be any of the pasta dishes, they have awesome french fries, and their side salads are great - probably the best tasting ranch dressing in awhile. I love coming here!  They also have a great breakfast selection I have yet to try...but those S more's pancakes look like the business, I will have to come back soon! =)
