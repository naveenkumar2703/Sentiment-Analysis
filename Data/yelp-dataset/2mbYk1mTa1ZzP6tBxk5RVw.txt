5	After having a horrible experience with trying to get my water heater fixed, I called John at All Service Plumbing.  He came the same day and was very polite and knowledgeable.  He explained everything in detail and even gave me some helpful information to prevent the problem in the future.  The previous plumber said I needed a new water heater even the one I had was only 3 years old.  John replaced 2 parts and save me hundreds of dollars.  I would definitely recommend him!
5	John and his people came out to my house after it was remodeled and fixed all the things needed to get my house back into top shape. He did an excellent job and I would not hesitate to call him anytime I have a plumbing issue.
5	In a panic, I needed someone to come take a look at our plumbing issue.  Unfortunately he couldn't come out, but he could tell I was upset, so he walked me through what some of the problems could be and tried to help me out as much as he could.  That says A LOT about a business.  I'd happily call him again if needed.
