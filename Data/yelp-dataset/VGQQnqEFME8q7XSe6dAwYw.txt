5	Not that you can compare Firebird to anywhere else in Az but I have been to Joliet Raceway in Chicago (and even though that's newer) I like the arrangement of Firebird and the availability of the different tracks available to race on.First off...  NHRA... come on... hands down one of THE coolest events in Az ever, next to NASCAR and well pro any sports but the 8000hp cars come only once a year.  The pits are setup nice so every ticket gets into the pits to check out the teams and cars, beer and food are expensive but what else is new.They also have drag racing events, any type of racing event, drift, road, moto races, dirt bikes, monster trucks, top fuel drag boats on the lake... I'm sure I'm missing a lot but nowhere else has this in Az.Parking is always good to go... driving out of there just takes a while as you've got one main road that you get on to funnel onto the I-10 but not much they can do about that.Great place... keep bringing in the NHRA and letting us use the road tracks for our motorcycles and I'll be happy.
5	Was here today hanging out with my friends from Pro Autosports racing on the main track. Was a great time as always!I bring my car here for Friday night drags in the cooler months, and other events. They have a good track and everyone is generally very friendly and helpful.
4	Been here a couple times for the XDC event and I've only ever really seen one track. BUT!!! When I do go, next to the track is a huge lake where people drive their different water vehicles and can do jumps I think if they want to go water skiing. I do get burnt when it's hot but when track doesn't get you burnt?
