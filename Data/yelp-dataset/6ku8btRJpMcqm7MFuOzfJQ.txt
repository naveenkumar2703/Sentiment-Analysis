5	We were looking to lease or purchase and although we have not finalized that purchase yet the staff here did guide us in the right direction i am definitely returning here to make my first purchase
1	I thought REMAX was a good choice when i went to short sale my home? , I was WRONG! They were very poorly educated on Short sales and the TEAM i used Cami Elliot, were far from knowledgeable about this process. they FAILED and helped lose my home of 14years and all of my great credit for years to come.IF YOU SHORT SALE USE SOMEONE ELSE! NOT REMAX.
5	Tiffany Haynes is a realtor that I can highly recommend. She has been in the real estate business for many years and has the knowledge and experience needed in this industry. She has developed a reliable team of contacts. She is especially knowledgeable for Canadians buying in the United States. Tiffany is always willing to go the extra mile!
5	I have been with RE/MAX for many years here in Arizona but have found RE/MAX Excalibur to be one of the best Offices.   The Owner/Management team does very thing they can to give us leading edge technology.  This helps to get our listings sold.  Virtual Tours posted on YouTube within a few days of the property being listed,  24Hour Information Hotline on any property that is listed in the Valley.  They truly work with us to promote our Business.   Please call me... Tiffany J Haynes,  Realtor, CDPE at 602-828-8996.  Website www.azsun4u.com.  I am proud to work with this Team.  I would love to work with you....
