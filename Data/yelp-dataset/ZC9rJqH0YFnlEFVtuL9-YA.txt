5	I have a story about this particular florists...About 3 years ago, my ex boyfriend was desperately trying to get back together with me - I'm quite a catch, y'know. We had broken up before I moved to Edinburgh but he didn't take it too well. Anyway, I hadn't heard from him in a few weeks so I thought he had moved on...until I got a phonecall telling me I had a package at reception. It was an empty vase and a single red rose. The card just said 'it's a' . I was totally confused...but low and behold the next day I got another phonecall, another package. Another rose...this time the card said 'new year' . Ok, so I was beginning to get it. Every day for a fortnight I got a rose with more words on it, concluding to 'it's a new year, so let's try a new start? meet me at the witchery, sunday 9pm' . Cute , huh!! I was totally impressed with Interflora though, they were extremely professional and their customer service was brilliant. They knew that the overall message was - since they were sending it every day, but still enjoyed it alongside me.  They were absolutely brilliant.You'll be glad to know I did go and meet my ex at the witchery and we did have a lovely meal. However, I told him we were never going to be together since he had slept with a married woman while we were together. All's fair in love and war.

My grandparents were sweethearts on my 21st when I received a beautiful vase sent to my flat from here- the delivery person was very professional and the flowers were gorgeous and lasted for days.
