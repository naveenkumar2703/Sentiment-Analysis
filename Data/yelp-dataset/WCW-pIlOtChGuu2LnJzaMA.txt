5	Whenever I need my checks cashed or to make a deposit I always come to this location.  It's down the street and I always get awesome service.  Everybody is always nice, and it really doesn't take long at all -- some locations I can't say the same about.The extra bonus: I usually come with my dogs in the back of my car and when I go through the drive-thru they send a biscuit with my receipt.  My dogs love this place as much as I do now.  -;)
4	I bank with the main giants.  Wells Fargo is one of those giant banks.  I am going to review the service of the location.  So if you want a review on the evils of big bank America, you won't find it here.  I needed to get some documents notorized.  I remember hearing that Wells Fargo did this for free if you have a certain account.  I walked into the branch and let them know what kind of checking account I had and they let me know that they notorize for free for all account holders. I sat and waited for the the associate to come get me.  I only waited for a few minutes.  I sat next to a kid who looked like he was getting ready to be interviewed.  I was then greeted by the Well Fargo associate and went to his office space.  His name was Paulo and he was a financial advisor for Wells Fargo.  He was very friendly.  I was happy that I didn't run into anyone that looked like they hated their job at this branch.  We had a long conversation which was great.  I have two small children so an adult conversation is always a breathe of fresh air.  Overall if I needed to do some banking at Wells Fargo I will most likely be at this branch.  If you are in the area check them out. Cheers!
2	Great people that work in the bank but as a whole, Wells Fargo is just as bad as the other large banks, responsible for the housing crisis in the US. GO LOCAL!!!
