3	I try and stay away from Chinese fast food.  I don't know why... it's just who I am.  But, there are times that I can be purely lazy and have a hankering for some Broccoli Beef and steamed rice.  Anyhow, Panda Express is close and easy to get to.  So, here is my review of tonight's visit.: - I drive over to Sam's Town, which has the closest Panda Express to me.  I park in the 2nd parking lot, on the ground floor. - I walk in to the North East entrance and Panda is right there on the left.  - There wasn't a line and I ordered my meal.  I had to wait a couple of minutes as they were replenishing their stock.  So, I had fresh Broccoli and Beef.  Woo Hoo!!! - I paid and then left...  easy as that.  My meal was okay but nothing to give it 4 or 5 stars.  With that said, it's an okay place to go if you are in a hurry and are too lazy to make your own rice.
4	The food was very good and tasty. Portions were big and priced reasonably.
3	Decent fast food Chinese food. It's close to the house for those I don't want to cook kind of nights. I will go back since the food is always good at this location.
