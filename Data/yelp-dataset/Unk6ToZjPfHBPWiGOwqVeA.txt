4	The best $5 dollar Chinese food around!  I come here regularly for their lunch specials.  You can get a very tasty Mongolian beef dish with white rice, egg roll or crab puff for under $5.  They have about 14 lunch specials to choose from or the extensive a la cart menu.  It's no frills dinning at its best.
5	I stumbled upon this treasure using my AroundMe app one night when my boyfriend and I were looking for delivery Chinese.  My family and I have been frequenting Shangri-La in the Metrocenter area for over 20 years and this may have topped it! Queen's Bowl checked all our boxes: option for delivery, authentic taste, soup available, and at a most valuable price.  We will make this a regular spot.  An absolute must!
5	Excellent food and a very good price. We go here at least twice a month. My kids also love the food!
5	Great food and at an affordable price! $25 fed my family of 5 :) And my wife loved it..."It's just what I have been looking for! And it hit the spot!!"
4	Was looking for a good local Chinese restaurant that delivered and this place did!  Best egg rolls I've had in a long time and the orange chicken & Mongolian beef was great too!  This is our new fave :)
5	Love Queens Bowl. Good quality food at a good price. Their service is friendly and fast.
3	The food here is decent, and they offer a good value. They have been in that location for more than 25 years, so they must be doing something right.
1	I was very disappointed in this meal last night. Based on the reviews I expected good quality food but instead the lo meins were lacking flavor, the orange chicken was soggy, and the crab cream cheese puffs had no crab. Don't eat here, there are other choices in the neighborhood!
