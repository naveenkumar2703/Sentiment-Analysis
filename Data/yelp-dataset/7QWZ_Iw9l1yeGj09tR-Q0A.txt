3	I stopped here to fill up before taking friends hiking at Mount Charleston.  It's not the cheapest, but it was an easy off and back on Flamingo on the way to Las Vegas Boulevard.  It was early in the morning--about 6:30--and there was only one car there.  I got my gas and was on my way in no time.  That's what I wanted and this 7 Eleven filled the bill.
4	It is what it is,  Stop here for a cold drink or a nice affordably cup of coffee. Service is alright as long as they are quick it's fine by me , no need for chit chat or smiles . In and out quickly !!! They are good at that!
3	I've been to this 7 Eleven many times. One time I was running really short on time, and had to catch the bus. I ran to the ATM to get some money out. I walked to the register to get change, and the gentlemen behind it was looking down fixing something or counting money. I asked for change and he tells me one second. I said "Please, can we hurry I am going to miss the bus" He tells me it's not his fault, and finally opens up the register and gives me change. I was really to scream at him for being a grump.. Soon as I walked out the door the bus was pulling up. I was so close to missing it. There is a older women that works there and she is the nicest person. I never have any problems with her. She asks if I need a drink when I am playing on the machines and gives fast service. Mr grump needs to be stocking or something.
