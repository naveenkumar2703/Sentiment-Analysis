5	Everyone here is SO friendly! I love this tanning salon! The place is super clean and the staff is wonderful. Their prices are a bit higher than what I'm used to paying, but I have NO complaints because the place is very clean and the atmosphere is very friendly.
2	Although I work at a salon already, I decided to come to solar energy because of their advanced spray tanner. I was so happy with the results.. Until the second time I visited. Both times, the staff was unfriendly and not helpful. They open at the last minute and never seem happy to be working. Also, the UV beds are subpar at best. When I asked how new of bulbs they had, the girl working told me they were "pretty new, about a year old". A year old!? Not very happy with this salon but the versa keeps me coming back.
5	NIce place, clean an very friendly staff. Took the time to really make me feel like a guest.
