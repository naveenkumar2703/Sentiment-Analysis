4	The Rat Pack is great! Cheap drinks and guy playing a jazzy cover of "Poker Face"--- what more could you ask for?It's the perfect, bizzare way to end you night. Let's put it this way, don't be shocked if you find yourself in a conga line in between two glammed-up, cackling middle-aged women. Shout requests at the musician and sing along! If he's cool, he'll play what you ask him to play.
4	Who knew going to my friends 25th birthday would mean we would encounter an 80th birthday at the Rat Pack and we'd still all have a ball? Not me. We walked in and the place looked really fun, although all the birthday balloons seemed weird. At first I thought it was for my friend but the numbers were all wrong. Quite a few birthday parties there that night. The drinks were delicious, my favourite was the Lynchburg, and the bartenders were hilarious. I went back and forth on the music but I still found myself dancing along sometimes, even though I am an absolutely and offensively atrocious dancer. Seriously. Do not go out in public with me if there will dancing. I normally avoid it myself. but the atmosphere in this place was just so fun. I'm so sad I didn't discover this bar when I lived in Edinburgh.
