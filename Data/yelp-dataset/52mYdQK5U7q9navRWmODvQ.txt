4	Great location for hikers and mountain bikers alike.  There are paths easy enough to bring along your kids, dogs, out of shape siblings, etc.   But you can run up some of the more steep/aggressive portions for more of a workout.  This mountain is not as crowded as some of the other Phoenix trails--so it is worth the extra drive.
5	This was a great stop to gain information regarding a hike that I'm considering of shooting a sunrise and or sunset. The volunteers that work at this center was so helpful, and knowledgeable. A big shout out to people volunteering the love and passion for us!
4	This is the largest entry spot into the North mountain park.  It is clean.  There are Rangers to help with trail and wildlife information.  The hike itself up Shaw Butte is on a maintenance road for the towers at the top.  It is pretty strenuous but being a road of sorts there is no congestion as hikers of different abilities pass and get passed.  The views of the West Valley are great and well worth the hike.
5	very nice and clean. plenty of parking.
