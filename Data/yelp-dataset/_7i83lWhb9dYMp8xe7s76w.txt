5	fastest computer repair ever! lets just say baby slobber and cords don't mix, but mac service experts fixed up my mac in less than 24 hours and it is working like new.
5	My poor beloved laptop died so I brought it to Mac Service Experts. Turns out I needed a new logic board, a pricey repair. Per my google search, their estimate was much lower than if I had taken it directly to Apple. I was also surprised with a new bottom cover, batter and 2 extra GB of memory for no extra charge. Great experience and my laptop is running like new!
5	Bryan at Mac Service Experts is top notch.  He has repaired several items for our company.  Each repair has been extremely smooth.  Good communication, super fast.  Great guy to work with.
