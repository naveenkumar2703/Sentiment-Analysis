4	I have been visiting this restaurant for 4 years now.  The employees are very courteous and the food is of good quality.  I have had very little problems aside from verbal communication issues with some of their employees that don't speak English very well.
5	Good food, good service. The times on yelp are incorrect and it is open. The food was good and the people working there are friendly and helpful.  Def stop in for some grub!
3	Carl's Jr. is a decent fast food restaurant, but I try to limit my trips. I don't really care for their french fries, but their burger is not too bad. I like that they have cheap soda and most of my visits are usually because I am looking for somewhere to get a quick inexpensive soda.
2	It was clean, they got my order right however the food didn't taste as good as I remembered. Lastly they had two large LCD TV's going it was quite loud, when I asked a employee if they could turn down the TV she said they don't have that control and walked away. If I want to watch TV I'll stay home and watch what I want to not some crap they feed us to watch. Take the TV's out of fast food and restaurants.
4	Starving after our flight here, this hit the spot!  Burger was great, couldn't eat it fast enough...Difficult to understand the lady in drive thru... took a good 5 minutes to get through what we wanted to order but otherwise it was fine.
4	Yum..good fast food, cheap prices. I mean if you gonna eat fast food I would pick Carls jr or Wendy's over all the rest.
1	For those who know me I detest burger joints.  I have a scale by which I rate restaurants. Burger joints are at the 1 start end. Most unhealthy as you can get. Watch out for corn feed beef!
