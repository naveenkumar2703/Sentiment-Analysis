5	Rory and Kristen take care of you like family!  AND they take care of your car too!I have never had a problem with the fixing my car...and it is ALWAYS cheaper than the next place.  They care about their customers and want you satisfied with the work that they do.
5	Thanks Jon for the great service on my Lexus. Your thorough checkup gave me confidence for a safe drive to Florida.
5	This is my go to place for any car related issue.  Very knowledgable, friendly, and honest.  What more can you ask for?
5	My family and I been going to Rory's for 10 years and there is a reason why - because this place is amazing.  The service is phenomenal; they treat you like a client as oppose to a transaction (they do a remarkable job at building rapport with their customers).  They take pride in their work simply because it's quality.  They are honest, reasonably priced and it's the only time I have ever been to an auto repair place where I did not feel like i was being taken advantage of.
5	After years of using the superstition springs Lexus dealer ship I decided to use Rory's. The estimate I got from the dealer ship was considerably more expensive than Jon at Rory's quoted me. I needed a lift to work after dropping my car at Rory's, Rory himself was kind enough to give me a lift to work as well as pick me up.The service was certainly 5+ star as well as the quotes and work that needed to be done. They work on most makes and models and have all kind of cool cars in there garage
5	Just got an alignment from Rory himself who took the time to explain what I was dealing with and how it was corrected.  The dedication, passion and a sense of pride at this shop is evident.  I cannot imagine getting better service anywhere.  I strongly recommend Rory's.
