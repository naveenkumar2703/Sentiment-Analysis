5	Best authentic Mexican food we have found since moving to AZ in 5 years.  Menudo 7 days a week. And I hate menudo Mexico but will eat theirs.
4	This is probably the closest place I have near me if I am craving some mexican food. I usually get the adobada burrito. Its really good and the staff is good too. I never had a complaint there at all. They are open most of the time too, sometimes even 24 hours. So, if you looking for something decent or craving a late night mexican meal you can't go wrong with this place.
5	We were looking for "hole in the wall Mexican" and yelp led us here. We ate in. Food was out and on our table within 3 minutes (no exaggeration). Food was delicious... Tacos were a bit greasy
