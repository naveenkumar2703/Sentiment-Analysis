4	All CVS' are created equal... well kinda. This CVS is very close to my old apartment so I would frequent it. Now I live across town and whenever I am in need of some sugar free gummies (bf is diabetic) or the Chase ATM I stop here! I love coming here because you can ALWAYS find a deal! Whether its Arrowhead 24ct water for 2.98$ or .99cent candy bags theres something for everyone. Even some of the make-up is decent priced! This time I got some water, and .99 sugar free gummies. They have a good selection of sugar free candy that is cheap also! The gummies are also very yummy!They have a HUGE liquor area, so if it late at night and you need some booze, stop here!!
5	I usually just stop in here when I have candy cravings on my way to work and can find good deals on chocolate! They also print out coupons which are actually pretty useful and with my CVS card I get emails with 25% off purchases every so often so that's a sweet deal too!
4	This is my go-to pharmacy. It's always clean, has great sales on all sorts of items from cat food to candy to whatnot.The drive-thru pharmacy is a great option, especially since I had MRSA for awhile and didn't want to contaminate anyone or anything.The cashiers, pharm tech, and pharmacist are always helpful and knowledgable. There is also a CVs card that allows your to save money or take upwards of 20% off your next purchase. My only beef is the odd hours kept and the lack of 24/7 availability. The parking lot is a nightmare.
5	Liquor and mixers sold here, along with hydration drinks.  They were all on sale! Woohoo!  The cashier cards too.  Not just one person, all.  She was pretty efficient too.  She let my friend go back and grab more drinks, and as we waited, she opened up another cashier to help speed up the line for check out.  I rarely see this...
