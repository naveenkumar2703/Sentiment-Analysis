3	This small sports bar is ok if you want to go out for a bit in your local area but is not the best bar I have ever been to for sure.Upside: A big tv to watch a game on, big buck hunter, pool, poker on some nightsDownside: No real outside seating, seating tends to crowed the walk ways inside, a bit of a dive
4	Great bar tucked away from most others. The atmospher along with the staff is second to none. cheap drinks and a good time. Good place to go an just relax with a beer and some good company.
