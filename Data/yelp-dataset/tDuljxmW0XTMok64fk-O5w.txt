5	Great motivating and supportive environment.  Emphasis on your own personal best and overall fitness.  Loved the stairs!
5	My son is a high school football player and loves working with Mike in the off season to get bigger, stronger and faster.  Mike makes all the workouts challenging and fun as well.  He teaches the kids the correct way to workout and watches each kid closely.  My son and a group of his friends really enjoy Infinity and plan to continue their workouts there for a long time.  They all feel great after their workouts with Mike.  He works them hard and interacts with these boys in a great, motivating way!!!!
5	If u haven't trained here, you GOTTA!!!
4	I have been training here for about 6 months with Jeff Cymbalski. He is an amazing trainer! I have seen incredible results in no time! I am a gym snob, I have trained at 8 private training facilities in the Valley over the years, and this is the first place that I have been 100 percent satisfied.  Jeff is super knowledgable and professional. the facility is clean, and new. Everyone that trains there has a very positive energetic vibe! Would highly recommend!
