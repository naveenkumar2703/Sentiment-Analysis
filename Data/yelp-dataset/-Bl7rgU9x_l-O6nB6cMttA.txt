5	Nice location. Nice People. No mistakes in the order.
3	I was in the area and needed some caffeine.  The baristas were friendly and quick, and I was on my way in a short time.  There's  not a whole lot more to say.
4	I read the reviews but decided to stop anyway.  I actually stopped on three occasions and noticed that they were busy on all three stops.  Despite being overwhelmed, the baristas were very friendly and got me my drink within a few minutes of ordering.  No complaints; except they may be too good and too busy, but they still do just fine.
3	This will be a moderate review or in Starbuck's terminology, a grande review. The best way to summarize the Starbuck's at the southeast corner of Decatur and Charleston Boulevards is BIG ON CONVENIENCE AND SHORT ON COMFORT.  The location sits at the corner of two hyper-busy Las Vegas highways in a Super Walmart Shopping Center surrounded by fast food places. If you are shopping, eating out, or cruising along eastbound Charleston and north and southbound Decatur (Decatur entrance controlled by a traffic signal) this is a convenient Starbuck's for a caffeine boost.  This has to be one of the tiniest Las Vegas Starbucks that I have visited. It just isn't very conducive to relaxing. There are only four tables, five counter stools, and a couch; which can fill up quickly in a hyper-busy area. The standard handicap table is nonexistent. On another note, a password combo is necessary to access the rest room. Forget about a drive-thru. It is attached to a Panda Express and Jamba Juice.  This Starbuck's needs some work to be the third place that it is supposed to be. I would not be surprised if Starbuck's rebuilds this location nearby as a modern third place with a drive-thru.*This Starbuck's is shown in an incorrect location. I checked into a Decatur Boulevard location that shows this store. Oh well.The 2013 Yelp 100. Review #160
