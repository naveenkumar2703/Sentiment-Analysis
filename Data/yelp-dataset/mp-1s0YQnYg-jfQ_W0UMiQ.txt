5	This place is Not Closed! It is off the beaten path.. Veez is Old school.. Playboy magazines to yar at while your getting a cut and ashave.. Its laid back and doesn't apologize for it.. They have great girls working there... Virginia has been cutting my har for about 3 years now.. She takes about an hour with shampoo, and beard trim, and scalp massage.. If you want a Central Phoenix old school experience.. This is the place..
4	Only good things come out of this salon... My hair being one of them!  I see Mara who works in the second room.  Mara has been cutting my hair for some time now.  I recently decided to take the plunge and get some color added to my locks.  I got some small wispy highlights at the front and ombre. So many compliments.  As with any stylist, photos and knowing what you want are helpful (they aren't mind readers!)  If something doesn't turn out right, Mara is always willing to have you back and fix it for little/no charge.  You can even stop in for a bang trim if you're not quite due for the full cut.  This place is tucked away just off 7th St, next to a dance studio and Fuego Bistro.  If I'm running early for my appointment, I have happy hour snacks and sangria at Fuego... Makes for a fun time getting your hair did!  ;-)
4	Great salon tucked next to Fuego Bistro. I have been seeing Mara for years and I leave a happy customer every time.  I love that she knows how I like my hair cut and make sure that I don't chop it all off. Mara offers fantastic hair cuts for a great price! She offers hair coloring services and she does amazing work. She's the best secret in Phoenix!
