4	This store is located at the Las Vegas Premium Outlets.  it is a division of L'Oreal Cosmetics. Their items were really well priced, sample sizes and full sized products.  Their selection was pretty awesome, gift sets and special sets were available for the holiday season. So, of course, everything was even more reduced. There weren't too many fragrances available but I have to admit I was still impressed with their selection. The sales gals weren't the most avaiable as they were receiving shipment as I walked in. But, they did take the time to let me sample some items, to smell some of the colognes and to give me a card. One girl apologized for the chaos and the mess. She asked if I needed help. I told her I'd return later. SHe was so appreciative but you could tell she also felt a little bad because she didn't like that I left without having enjoyed the full "experience". It's OK. I came. I saw. I left. It was fun. I'll be back.
3	Got my Lancome fix here.  Only $10 for one of their Juicy Tubes.  Best deals were the gift sets, but those aren't for me.  Not a big space, but definitely a bunch of merch.
1	I was hoping to score some Lancome deals, but left disappointed. They didn't carry the products I generally shop for. Employees weren't helpful so I left.
