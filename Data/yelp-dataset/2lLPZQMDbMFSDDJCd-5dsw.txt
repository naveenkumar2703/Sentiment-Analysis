3	Umm, Ok its fast food three stars dare i give it four.  Midwest Does not Have the option for Jack-N-The Box, anyways i do have something to write home about,  Not to self the Jack-N-The Box Breakfast is not just served all day but great,  I'm sold by the little pancakes drenched in syrup then popped into my mouth. How fun.Thanks Mr Jack-in-the Box I like the commercials.
5	I've been coming here for almost two years. The people who work the drive thru are always very nice. I used to work fast food when I was a teenager: I know how AWFUL drunk customers (sober ones too!) can be so I'm all the more impressed that the crew of this store has such dignity and poise. Bravo.The food is always made when I order it, so my burgers and fries are hot and tasty. Living around the corner has its perks, so I'll be back.Thank you to everyone at this store for awesome service!
1	The ladies that were working todayWere almost skeptical after I used2 coupons like the coupons wereFake or something so this is whereMy issue is 1 uninformed employees2 as I ordered they never asked   Was there anything else so they   Just kept telling me the price when    I wasn't done ordering 3 They didn't bother to ask me was it for   Here or to go until they had it all together4 just all around inept customer service
