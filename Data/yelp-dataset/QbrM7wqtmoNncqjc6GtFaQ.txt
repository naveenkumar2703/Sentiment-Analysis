1	I recently went into sams club and had the worst customer service I have ever had at a sams club.... no one could take responsibility for there service... I have had a tax exempt business account for about 10 years, I gave the COS my card and I will never shop there again...... they should get zero stars...

5	Great prices at the eating place for hot dogs and pizza. So inexpensive. 5 stars just for that.  Sometimes they have a Groupon for membership here. If you see that you should get it, it's a good deal and you get enough freebies and a gift card to just about make up for the membership price.
1	Today I was denied entrance in SAMs club and I have spent well over millions of dollar in the past 9 year I have had my business witch is mind-boggling and I know Most of the employees and friendly with them but this shows u that big corporations do not care about us small mom and pop business and the consumers that bring in money
