5	Great value @ $129 a night.  There is a solid restaurant next to the lobby with a good craft beer selection.  Chef and managers are both very friendly and you can tell they take pride in what they do.   Rooms are standard hotel rooms with modern finishes.  I am a fan of the Four Points Chain so far.  Free wi-fi too.
5	What a great hotel!  Modern & Clean and a good restaurant.  The best part is the staff.  I stayed there over 5 weeks this winter and to a person the staff was helpful, friendly and easy-going.  Even working in Waterloo, this hotel was worth the 20 minute commute (good place for all you consultants at RIM, Manulife, SunLife, etc.)
4	As expected from Four Points, excellent Front Desk service, friendly and efficient staff--checking in and out was a breeze.  The rooms are clean and tidy.  They have everything I needed, but there's one thing I wish they have for their guests, disposable slippers.Breakfast, well, for convenience, it's not bad.  They offer cereals, apple and orange juice, etc.  Hot food consists of breakfast sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, made-to-order omelettes, waffles and pancakes.  Salty, salty, bland, burnt (twice), gave up on the rest, respectively.  Don't expect much in terms of their breakfast items.  It is what it is.Breakfast service, just like any of their other staff, nice and friendly.30 Day Yelp Challenge (2/30)
5	I stay here about 3 times a year. Its very comfortable and friendly, but what makes this place worth coming back to is the restaurant! The food is absolutely on point. I get excited to stay here just so I can order room service! Try the apple carpaccio arugula salad and the Indian Tikka dish. The rooms are comfortable and with a modern touch.
3	This hotel was fine for our overnight. Our room featured a door to separate adults from children. Nice feature! Also on the pro side, the staff was kind.The overall place was a bit dirty. Our shower didn't work. The pool deck was incredibly slippery.
