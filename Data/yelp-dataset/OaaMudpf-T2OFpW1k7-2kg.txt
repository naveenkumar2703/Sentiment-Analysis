4	This place is super-promising! They have their own wood-fired oven, and sell pizzas and sandwiches (and apparently bakery items at other times).I got the "Duke" pizza, their main specialty. It was too wet, but the toppings and in particular the caramelized onions were great. I hope they solve the liquidity problem and get a crispy crust instead.The soda selection is cool too - they have a bunch of flavours of the "Dry" brand soda.
5	Fantastic pizza. Great to have them in town making authentic thin crust pizza. Tried four kinds all great.Without a doubt the best pizza in town. Crust was cracker thin! Spectacular.
3	Great family run business! They have a really nice little place with some of the best scones and pizza around. The breads are baked fresh in the morning so you'd want to go in on the earlier side to get the best selection (raspberry scones are really nice). The pizza oven is fired up around 11am; tried the duke and it had a lovely thin crust. Definitely worth a return trip, or two or three.
5	Amazing pizza a must try, great stop for the family, great service and very welcoming
5	Great Pizza!  Very tasty! Love the wood oven. Friendly Owners. Would go again for sure.
4	This place had the best wood fired pizza I've had in Kitchener. It was quaint and cute, but could be set up better around the till, as it gets congested when ordering and getting drinks. I would definitely come again.
