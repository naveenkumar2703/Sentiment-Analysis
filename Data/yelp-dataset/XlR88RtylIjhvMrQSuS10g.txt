3	A greasy spoon at the rear end of Leith Walk is a welcome addition. There are plenty of  specialist cafes but none that serve normal food.The decor in this place is a little basic but the place is religiously clean. Grabbed a bacon roll on a lunch break and it was exactly how I imagined it would be. Got a cup of tea after words and it was the same affair.Nothing new, nothing special, but that's exactly what I needed at the time.
