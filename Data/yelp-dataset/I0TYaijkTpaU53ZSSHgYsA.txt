1	THE WORST Company EVER~! Cancel my phone & internet in Feb 2011, they kept billing me until July. I called twice every month telling them I have cancel and to stop taking $ from my bank account. They tell me, my canceling order is pending & frozen in their system with an error. So FIX IT. They can't fix it & spend me to every damn department to get it fix. Still not fix & it's Sept. Trying to get my refund is a joke. No one knows what's going on in my case. I tell them there should be LOTS of notes on my acct. They just keep transferring me to other departments. Or tell me to hold & get disconnected. Please wait about a month. Everything should be fix by then. Well it's SEPT and NOTHING IS FIX YET. I still didn't get my refund of $354.69 This company is ridiculous. Update: Sept 29 Call back today and still no refund. Still can't fix the problem & give me, my refund. Now they have another BS to give me. I think I heard it all from them =T UPDATE: 10/25/11 Call today 1st agent didn't know what he was talking about give me mad BS & didn't even ask for my name or acct #. Transferred me to another department. They said to wait 90 days. I told them I been waiting since FEB to now. SO she transferred me to another department. All that agent can say is that is our policy you just have to wait there isn't anything we can do about it. Are you serious this is so beyond RIDICULOUS~! Update: 11/4 still waiting for my check. =T Update finally got a check in Jan 2012, Waited almost a full year to get my refund and no interest no apology from them nothing.
1	Worst company I have ever had the misfortune of having to deal with. A salesman told me internet would cost $30/month. They called back 2 days later to offer me internet for $45/month plus the cost of a router. Finally, a few hours later I was told it would be $50/month. I will never deal with century link for anything due to the incompetence of their employees.
1	Cheaper than cox and for obvious reasons!!!! Century link is horrible, first off I waited almost 2 weeks for them to come out and hook up my service. The technician that came out was actually super nice, knew what he was doing, great customer service. I signed up for  cable, phone, and internet with them. besides the face that my bill changed each month,  and I noticed I was getting charged for using *69 (which I had added the *69 feature) and when I called to inquire about that and why my bill was dramatically different. The rep I spoke with told me that I did in fact have the feature however I never called to activate it so I had been charged each time I had used it, and then she gave me several reasons to why my billing was always another amount each month. I then requested for them to cancel my service and pick up their equipment  and I called cox and had them connect my services again yet I continued to get bills from century link, each time I called ( about 4 times total) to have them cancel my service they said ok and someone would pick up the equipment, 5 months later I am now getting calls and letters from collections and I still have the equipment sitting in my apartment waiting to be picked up. I even told them I work in the office where I live so they can call me or stop by the office to pick it up if I am not home. This company is a joke cox may not be the best company but century link is the WORST!!!!
1	BEWARE!!  Even if you get a decent monthly rate when you sign up, they will add various fees.  When I called I specifically told them that I only needed a few months of service.  They quoted me a rate, then when I received my first bill there was a connection fee (around $25 I believe), then after I cancelled my service after the two months I needed, they charged me a CANCELLATION fee as well!!
2	I contacted them via email about the hidden charges.  They refunded the disconnect fee.
1	they say if you type something in capitals you are either yelling or emphasizing.  in my situation it is both!!  so hear me loudly...***the worst service ever!***  i can sit here and write this long list of things that they've done wrong.  but for anyone to take the time out to write these things is just enough said! escalation is a joke.  all it means is we have a lot of other clients more important than you!  even though we know that you are at our mercy, that doesn't matter what matters is that we are going to make the calling center so difficult that you will just have to call in 3-4 times after being transferred all over the usa to the wrong departments! and there is nothing you can say or do but wait! *********wow*********
1	Never has customer service and competency been so bad...never. Wasted my time, money...no apologies. No compensation. By the end of a frustrating two day experience, I simply cancelled everything.
1	Century Link is consistently unreliable and uncooperative.  Their "customer service" people seem to work off of scripts, and they don't care about, or even understand, personal service.  Every time I have contacted them about a problem, they have been consistently uncooperative.  If you are finally able to deal with an actual technician, the technicians themselves are usually pretty decent and try to be helpful, but the customer service people are horrendous and utterly frustrating to deal with.  I would advise anyone to stay away from this company.
1	So frustrating. Consistently one of if not THE worst customer service lines I've had the displeasure of dealing with. It takes forever to speak to someone and that's after waiting and being transferred around to the right department. Somehow I always get sent by a rep to some random voicemail. Our phone line and internet service go down whenever it rains in Vegas. It never fails. I can always count on our phone and internet not working whenever there's a thunderstorm.  I can also always count on them to take their time  sending a tech the next day to our house if at all. Absolutely the worst phone/internet service I've ever had. Total garbage. I'm done with this company.
1	My bill goes to CenturyLink in Phoenix, but that's likely just a billing center, so I'll write my experience here.I switched to CenturyLink for only home internet at the urging of a DirecTV customer service agent when I called into them to cancel/save on my bill. I was offered a "bundle" discount through DirecTV for using CenturyLink for my home internet. I previously had Cox internet and was fine with the price, the service, etc. I switched because it was going to save me around $15 on my DirecTV bill and was about the same price as my internet with Cox was ($39/month).Our home internet was installed/connected by a tech on Sept 16, and she was professional. Unfortunately that's when we were told that our perfectly good, nearly new Zoom router was not "compatible" with CenturyLink's DSL. I was never told that on the phone. She informs us that they can either charge us about a $6/month router rental fee or we can buy it for about $100. OK, whatever.Internet is working, seems about as fast as they said it would be (10 MB/s downlad speed). HOWEVER, when I get my first bill it was not the approximate $150 I expected ($45 for Oct-Nov pre-billed, about $35 or so for the partial month of service in Sept, the $60 installation fee DirecTV  informed us of, and any applicable taxes). NOPE, it was for $184.48. They charged us MORE for the partial month of service (Sept 16-Oct 8) than for the full month of service! I called into them to inquire, waited 12 minutes and after about 2 minutes of actual discussion with a customer service rep the call was abruptly disconnected. I was sitting still in my house, with full signal on my phone. WTH? I call back, wait on the phone again for about 10 minutes, and I get another rep so I have to start my story all over. She is in the midst of going through the charges (rather ineffectively) and explaining why it was so much (she confirmd that yes, they don't "discount" partial months when they prorate them, which is why my first 23 days of service actually cost MORE than the full 30 day month did...how does that make any sense?!) The call disconnects again!!! Note that once again, I have full signal, full battery and was completely stationary during the call.I immediately call DirecTV, get someone after only about 3 minutes of waiitng and surprise, surprise: I talk to him for about 10 minutes with NO issues of the call dropping. Clearly it was CenturyLink's phones that disconnected. Luckily, the agent at DirecTV was at least sympathetic to my concerns and troubles with the two dropped phone calls, so he said he'd put in a request for them to look at my inquiry and call me back in the next few days. Nothing so far and it's been one week.I have worked out to the penny what I think my bill should be ($151.25) and once I do get ahold of someone at CenturyLink, I intend for them to adjust this or I'll be opening a complaint with the BBB and likely cancelling my DirecTV simply because they talked me into switching to CenturyLink.I'll keep you all posted on things...wish me luck!
