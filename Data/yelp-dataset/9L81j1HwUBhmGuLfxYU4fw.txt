4	Most frozen margarita places around the strip have the same 5 flavros with different names. Not Evening Call! This particular location has great staff! They will let you sample without pressuring you to buy. They will also make you their own special combos!My Favs were : Sin City Cider and Jack n Cola ~ Yum!Although a bit pricier than its neighbor the Rockin Taco, they have a ton more unique flavors.
4	We were walking from MGM to Aria and Cosmopolitan and made pit stops at every place that had alcohol along the way and making new friends at every stop. This was one of our last stops. My friend was holding a cup and he was like "here! Try this!  It's like apple pie!" He was right.Somehow, we ended up with 5 of the Sin City Ciders for free. I'm pretty sure they were from one of our new-found friends. They have a lot of tasty frozen alcoholic beverages here. But the Sin City Cider has got to be my current favorite. It has Fireball and cider...it's like dessert with a kick...on the head. Next time, I'll get a yard. Yum!Everyone in our group was totally trashed and surprisingly, I wasn't. I figured out which new-found friends bought our drinks as I saw her faceplant while we were on the walkway from City Center to MGM and Metro was mean-mugging her instead of helping her get up. Shame!
5	I love coming here. The guys let me mix the flavors & actually add shots of vodka for no additional cost!! These guys are nice too. Its worth the prices. When visiting Vegas, come to this"Evening Call" location. My favorite...
