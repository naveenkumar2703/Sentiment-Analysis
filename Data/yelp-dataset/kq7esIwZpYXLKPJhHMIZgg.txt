4	Ok.  This place is a little pricey, but the products they have you can't find at Dicks or Sports Authority.  For instance, you can't find climbing gear at the other two. You can find pocket stoves at Dicks but not as much selection as SC.  Same goes for Water filters, dehydrated foods for camping, maps, etc. etc.They have top notch beach cruiser bikes, baseball/softball gloves, weight equipment, clothing.Yes, pricey, but the quality is superb. And sales staff is knowledgable in their respective departments. This is one of those rare places that I wish I could win a shopping spree to.
4	Lots of fun things to look/play with. If you can't find what you're looking for at other sports stores, they'll have it here.
4	I was surprised to find more hiking gear here than REI or Cabelas. I bought a 4L bladder here which is the largest I've come across in ANY other sporting goods store. There's a couple of other cool items I've found here that I have on mental layaway. They also have a really dope swimwear section. I bought a two piece here that was pricey but I rocked it at the river and a few lakes this summer and didn't see anyone else with the same one. There's nothing worse than showing up at party cove and someone else is wearing your same bikini.
4	This location has a great selection of everything sporting goods. I especially like the hiking and camping section which is packed with fun stuff to spend your money on. I've spent tons of money here through the years and have always had a good experience with the staff. The guys in the shoe department have been very helpful through the years and I am glad that they talked me into buying the Superfeet inserts for my shoes. This has been and will continue to be my go-to sporting goods store. Only beef is that it tends to be a lil pricey.
