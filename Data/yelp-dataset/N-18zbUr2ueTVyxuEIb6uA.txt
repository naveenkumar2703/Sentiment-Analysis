4	My neighborhood grocery store.  Good hours, gets the job done.  You absolutely have to have a Safeway discount card.  It's to the point where it's less a discount with the card and more a severe surcharge for people who aren't paying attention and don't get a card.
4	Who knew the Safeway deli was this good?  Got myself one of their signature sandwiches and boy was it yum.  Cobb salad on a roll basically as I've forgotten the fancy name.  In and out pretty quick, I'll be back to try another.
3	This place is close to home and great for basics and such. Has a nice deli and often has good deals on items in their butcher shop.
4	I go there to get my FAVORITE sandwich, Turkey Cranberry.  Not everyone wil make it for you, but they do YUMMO.  There premade Thai chicken salad is delicous too.
2	As George clooney said in O Brother Where Art Tho.....a geographical oddity, 2 weeks from everywhere. I don't know if it was just our list but the things we were shopping for (hamburger, buns, etc....) where not readily available. Crazy strange huh......oh well, we improvised
3	It's Safeway!  Whaddaya want?  Typical Safeway store.  Nothing special.  Typical products.  A bit pricey compared to other groceries.  No surprise there.  Use the Safeway app to get "personalized coupons".  You definitely can save some money that way.  Safeway store brand products are respectable.  Better than most other store brands.
4	I'm here a few times a week for small stuff,  but I never do any major grocery shopping because the prices,  like all Safeway stores,  tend to be on the high side.   I've never had any issues with customer service,  and the staff is helpful and nice.   This is kind of a small Safeway so there isn't as big of a selection as some of the newer ones.   Very clean and organized,  and it's had a few renovations over the years to make it a little more modern.
