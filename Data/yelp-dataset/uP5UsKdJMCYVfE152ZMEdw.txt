5	Pam is the best massage therapist I have been to so far! I was in a car accident and have a lot of scars, aches and pains. If you are looking for someone who knows what they are doing call Pam.
5	Intuitive Touch is awesome!  Whether you would like a relaxing massage or you need deep tissue massage Pam is the one to call.  Nice atmosphere, relaxing and you never feel rushed. Intuitive Touch also has flexible hours.
5	I have been looking for a good massage therapist  for some time. A good friend suggested I try Pam at intuitive Touch, and I'm so glad I listened! I have degenerative disc disease and fibromyalgia and Pam knew exactly what I needed. Great location, relaxing atmosphere, very reasonably priced and amazing massage! I found exactly what I have been looking for! Thank you Pam!
5	I have been going to Pam for several years and love her massages.  I have gone for certain areas, shoulders, arm for my tennis elbow or just for a relaxing massage.  I have always received a good massage no matter what area she is working on for me.
