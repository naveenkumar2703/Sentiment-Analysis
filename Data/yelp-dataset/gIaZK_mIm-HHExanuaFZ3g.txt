4	I stopped by my local hi-health store today to pick up a few things... I like this location better than some of the others I've been to.  The employees are friendly but leave you alone to wonder if you please, and the store itself is clean and well layed out.I found what I needed in no time (Diet Turbo Tea specifically) and also picked up some things I didn't need (a couple of protein bars, protein pudding, and some natural and organic body lotion).I do think that Hi-Health's pricing is a bit high... but I guess if I were to try to find another health food store with better pricing, I'd be paying the difference with time and gas prices, so I'll stick to HH for now!
5	Excellent selection, usually has everything I need. Helpful staff.
4	I stopped in right before closing on Sunday, I wanted to make sure I did not stay after 6 PM (closing time).  Not only did the staff not rush me but they took extra time to explain and tell me what were the better products and deals.  They are cheaper, friendly and the store is cleaner than GNC.  Will be going here instead going forward.
