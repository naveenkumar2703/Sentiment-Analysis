4	I work in the office building attached to Fashion Square Mall.  Around 3:00pm everyday I hear a faint whisper above the hum of the AC and the tap tapping on the keyboards of surrounding coworkers.  Do you hear it too...it is the Wetzel's Pretzels Pretzel bites calling my name.  I put on my headphones and then I swear I catch a whiff of their buttery salty goodness. It is so hard to not race into the mall and grab a bag and completely ruin my dinner.This place cranks out delicious and fresh pretzels in a variety of flavors and sizes.  They even have a hot dog wrapped in a pretzel, be still my heart.    They are not quite as good as my home state's Auntie Anne's but they are really great when you have a snack attack.
3	After a hard day of shopping at Fashion Square my heart yearns for a Wetzels Pretzel.  This place has never let me down and I have purchased one to many pretzels here, believe me.  In my experience the pretzels are always served warm, buttery, and with the perfect amount of salt.  They have all kinds of varieties of pretzels and sauces for your snack adventure.
1	Extremely poor customer service, "management" with typical fast food worker "i don't care" attitude.
3	These pretzels are a guilty pleasure once in awhile when I go to the mall-- yum!  Their lemonade is pretty disappointing though. Way too tart!
