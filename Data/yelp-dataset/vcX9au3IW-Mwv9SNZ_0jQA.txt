3	First visit. Clean store. Was in a hurry and the associate got me in and done very quickly. Will return.
4	Walked in on an after noon and was quickly seated. Even though I wish they would update there example books, my stylist seemed to know what I was describing. I wish I remembered her name because she worked quickly, new what she was doing and surprised me with a cute cut. And it was only $12 w/ out the tip!!!Hopefully when I come back I'm able to see the same service.
2	Dear God I should have ran to the hills when I walked in and saw 5 out of 5 people working there with electric shears in their hands. I refuse to call them stylists. I mean all I wanted was a trim for my 7 year old. Just a straight line. I'd hate to see her take a sobriety test.
