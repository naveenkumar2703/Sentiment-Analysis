5	The showed up when they said they would. Very professional. They checked our AC/Heat pump to make sure it was in working order for the winter. Would do business with again.
5	I've been using Bishop Air for more than 10 years, and they've kept my 16-year-old A/C unit humming with yearly maintenance calls. The guy I always request is Garlen: he is super-conscientious and does a great job cleaning the coils and getting debris off the unit outdoors. He checks everything and doesn't try to create problems or tell me to replace parts unnecessarily. I recommend Bishop Air highly.
5	Super honest and I really trust them to do 100%! Highly recommend.
1	I would give them a zero if I could.  The owner was rude and unhelpful when I tried to narrow down when the tech would be there.  I have tenants freezing in my rental property and she could care less.  She said between 12-3 and I called to see when at 2:00 when nobody had showed.  I asked if she could call the tech and if he could call in way so we would know.  She yelled NO and offered no assurance if when I could expect him to show up.  I told her make it 2:30 or forget it.  She said no so I hung up.  She consequently called me at 2:30 stating in an almost joyful tone that she was canceling the appr.  Good luck getting any business when you treat people in this manner.
