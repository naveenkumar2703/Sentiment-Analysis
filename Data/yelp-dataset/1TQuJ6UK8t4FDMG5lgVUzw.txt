3	Hmmm...interesting concept. Is it a store? Is it a museum? Not sure. But one thing's for sure, it is sparse. But pretty. Kind of like I imagine Jessica Simpson's mind would be. Vintage, couture...lots of beautiful clothing. But. Do. Not. Touch. Yes, we were told to not touch anything. Well. We could touch ourselves, but that's another story. So? Museum? Hmmm...still not sure. We had a delightful and informed employee/manager/owner explain to us their concept. Well. I never really got it. All I know is that where this vintage Halston dress that I can't touch once occupied the space for gay/indie flicks section at the now adios Movies On Central. Ok. I don't get the concept. But the fashions were exquisite. Including the display furniture and book collection. But. I didn't touch any of it. Cuz. They scared me. Really? Don't touch the clothes. Please don't pick the daisies (anyone who gets this reference is OLD!)Weird. Cool. Different. Like me in jr. high. But, I kinda like this place.
5	Best vintage collection I've ever seen! Proprietors were super friendly and fabulous and I touched everything I wanted to see. I couldn't afford any of it, but it was like a breath of fresh air to see such gorgeous wares shown in such a glorious setting.
