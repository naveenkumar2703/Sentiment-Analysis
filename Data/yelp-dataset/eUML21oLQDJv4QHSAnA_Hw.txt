4	If you're in the area you've got to check this place out. We had both breakfast & lunch here this weekend & were incredibly impressed with their food. Plus they deliver. :-)
5	Great bagels, fantastic pizza & great sandwiches.  If you are from the east coast, this place will remind you of it.  The have been making pizzas for over 40 years.  You can't go wrong.
3	Went here today because of the reviews on Yelp. The bagels are beautiful, thick and have a great chewy quality I like. The only reason I'm only giving it three stars is because they were extremely salty. I thought maybe it was just the plain bagels, but the others I bought were also too salty. Maybe that's a New York thing? I never ate bagels while I was there so I don't know but it was too much for us. Very friendly service and I would like to try them again and see if maybe we just got a bad batch.
5	Great Family ran place.  Tony and his family and staff truly take pride in the food that they serve you.  Great sandwiches and bagels!  Very friendly and genuine like deli's of old.  I love this place!
