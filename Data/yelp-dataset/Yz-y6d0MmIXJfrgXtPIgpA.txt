5	I can't tell you enough good things about We Print Vegas and Jon! Thank you so very much for everything. We have the exact windows we were looking for! Every time someone comes by our shop they stop, stare and then come in! That's just what we wanted!! We actually didn't know exactly what we wanted when we came in but Jon asked the right questions, got his answers, and BAM we had exactly what we wanted! Thanks again!Tammie MannMaryAnn MeyersGet Your Vape On Vegas
5	I've been here about 3 times so far since they opened and ordered business cards, banners and flyers, and recently a window wrap from them.  The place is pretty big and was always welcomed right when I arrived.  Jon and Hernan is super attentive to the specific designs and look that I needed.  It came out way better then expected and looks great.  The service was really fast from design to print.  I will definitely be coming back.
5	These are my go to guys for printing they bust their ass and get my stuff done when I need it and for the price I need it not much more I can ask. All the products I've ordered have been quality and unlike other local print shops in the area they take the time to listen to what I need and I ever don't leave feeling ripped off.
