4	I tried this cleaners after having a terrible experience with 215 cleaners across the street and I have not been disappointed. The prices are reasonable and they have next day service on the weekdays. The store is open on weekends for pick up and drop offs but they do not actually clean anything on Saturday or Sunday. The lady who owns the place is super nice and she always has some candy out for the customers (yum!). I will defintiley continue to use this cleaners as long as I live over here.
1	I'll admit it, after seeing the good ratings this business accumulated over the years I walked through its doors with high hopes. I have a white down comforter that I share with pets. For that reason, on occasion, I need to take it to the dry cleaners to have it cleaned. Believe me, if I could somehow fit it into my tiny washer at home instead I would, it would certainly be kinder to my wallet. Perhaps after my experience here you can find me putting every ounce of strength I have into fitting it into my washer from this point on. When I finally made it to the front of my line I handed my neatly folded comforter to the person at the register. As I filled out paperwork they unfolded it, glanced my way with a furrowed brow and reprimanded me in front of all the other customers for not cleaning it before I brought it in. I'm sorry, I was unaware that one of the pre-requisites for taking your dirty laundry to a dry cleaner was to clean it yourself beforehand. I could feel my cheeks grow hot as I apologized for my apparent uncleanliness (I've never heard of anyone ever bringing clean linens to the dry cleaners). I will not be returning here.
