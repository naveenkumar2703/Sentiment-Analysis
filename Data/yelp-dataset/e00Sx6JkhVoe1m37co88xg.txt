5	Well executed training - in just shy of 4 hours I earned my CPR, First aid and AED certificate.  Kari brought in real world anecdotes to supplement the videos.  Training equipment was excellent.  Only negative is the run down strip mall where the business is located - I was a bit concerned walking to my car late at night, but I am also unfamiliar with the area.  I would returned for further training.
5	All of these years, I have always wanted to learn CPR. Now that my wife and I are earning our Foster Parents license. This is one of the requirements! This is a four hour class, yes four hours!!! I for one I was happy it was this long, There is no way you can learn safety in just an hour or so. Our class was CPR, First Aide, and AED for adults and infants. My worst fear has always been if someone close to be is in need for help and I couldn't help. Now I have a lot more confident in knowing I can at least try, and make a differences.  Everything was hands on and video training. I will definitely come back when I need more training!
5	I signed up for the 4 hour long CPR and First Aid class. I was afraid that the class would drag and that I would regret choosing to spend my Friday night here. It was actually a really fun and interesting experience! I had Paula as my instructor, who has lots of Real Life Emergency EXPERIENCE working as a volunteer EMT for the MCSO. Her stories made the content even more interesting and relevant. I feel much more prepared to act in case of an emergency, although I hope I'll never have to use it!
