5	This is a convenient location, out of the hustle and bustle of the main part of Desert Ridge shopping center. My dogs enjoy going into the store to check out the wide variety of TREATS and CHEWS! There is an entire aisle of desiccated animal parts (ew, I know-- but the canines dig it) and the pricing is reasonable compared to some other boutique pet stores. They sell Nature's Variety/Instinct frozen raw food and the price is actually pretty good compared to other places I've checked including online. I'm glad this place opened on the north side.
5	Awesome customer service great deals on good quality dog food petsmart who?
5	A great experience with the employee who rang up my charge, very friendly. This store carries a variety of great products that you cannot find at other pet stores in the area. I am a huge fan of any pet supplies store that offers organic and quality products.
