1	Horrible Service- to the extent that I had to come on and write about a mcdonalds... Lol
1	Worst McDonalds in Vegas! Bad service consistently and sloppy made food. 3 trys and still crap. WTF! I am sure the hobo's panhandling outside could do better. They seriously must go out of the way to fuck things up. I just want to know what other McDonalds this Franchisee owns so I can avoid those also.
1	Agree, worst McDonalds ever. Not only did they mess up our order, they messed up the order before ours.
