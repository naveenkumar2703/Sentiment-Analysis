3	Friends called me yesterday afternoon and asked me to stop and have a beer with them and watch the ALCS game.  Sort of a cool neighborhood bar with a small bar food menu.  Most of the patrons seemed to know each other or were in small groups at a single table like we were.  I counted 7 screens but I forgot to see if there were any over by the pool tables.  4 pool tables, 7 dart boards, shuffleboard and a couple of video games.  The tables and stools are all anchored.  The door has been replaced with a privacy wall in the men's room and the one stall looks like the door has been removed and replaced a few times.  The padded rails on the tables need reupholstering.  Overall the place seems in pretty good shape.  They have a fenced in smoking patio but I didn't see any chairs or tables on it.I had a toasted ham and cheese on sourdough ($5.75)and I chose to have it with onion rings, although I could have chosen fries or cottage cheese.  It was good and I thought a pretty good deal.  I had MGD long necks at $3 each.  Not sure if that was happy hour or regular price, I didn't ask.  All the employees I dealt with were pleasant and efficient.  I Left by 7 so I don't know if the vibe changes as the evening goes on.  I noticed several folks just like me that joined friends and left after a drink or two.  I had a good time with friends and wouldn't hesitate to go back again.The woman opening up early Saturday sure looked at me funny taking pictures of the place as she walked up to the door. :-)
3	Jimbo's is a good neighborhood bar.  They have lots of dart machines, pool tables, and a shuffleboard.  The beer selection wasn't too large but they were decently priced and from 10pm until 1am you call it's are $3.00.
4	One of my favorite dive bars!  Pool, darts, shuffle board etc.  Great juke box!  Bar food is really good actually.  Everyone is very friendly as well!
3	Free breakfast everyday from 9am-noon. (With the purchase of a drink) 3 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, hash browns, and 2 pieces of toast. Good stuff. Can't beat the deals here. Worth your time!
4	Free breakfast or free booze!? Either way..... #winning!
5	allways go in the morning! order a drink get free breakfast.....  9-12
4	Best jukebox box on this side of town.  I used to just come for breakfast but turns out its a great late night too.
5	Five star "Dive Bar"!!!! Beer $1. Seven and seven $5.  Breakfast.  Free. Hair of the dog...  Priceless!!!!!!
4	Free breakfast with the purchase of a drink. We went on a Sunday morning, order a bloody mary and they give you a choice of either scrambled or regular fried eggs, hashbrowns, sausage and bacon. Come to find out they do free breakfast everyday. My wife had a mimosa and our bill was $13. Apparently they have crazy happy hour specials too.
3	That place is very, very dark but the beer mugs are big and cold! lol. The service was good and their BLT was yummy, plus they give you a BIG portion of fries. I was bummed that I was there during the wings and onion rings but didn't get any. Boo!! Maybe next time :)
1	Suppose to be a dive sports bar. If ur a metal or hard rock fan and try to play music on the jukebox,the owner has instructed the staff to skip it. They allow, classic rock, rap and country..if the bar is going to treat the customers like that then maybe he needs to specify that he runs a ghetto ass bar. The fact that I was told that I couldnt listen to what was on the jukebox was baloney. My friends play darts for this bar. The owner is an ass. He lost several customers tonight. And the fact that it was also my birthday too made things worse. Wouldn't recommend this bar.
3	Stopped in here for a couple football Sundays this season, and had a couple different experiences.  This first time was good, our waitress was attentive.  We ordered an appetizer sampler than was more than enough for 4 people (though I might have exceeded my cheese curd quota for some time).  In addition to the free wings in the afternoon this place seemed like a keeper.  The second trip was a little different.  Had to hunt for our waitress just to get a drink, and they arbitrarily chose not to do the free wing promo that day because "they kitchen was busy", even though the place seemed no busier than previous visits.  That left a bad taste with us, but maybe we'll be back to see if that was just a minor hiccup in what was an otherwise decent dive bar.
4	Been There 3 times now.. This is a really fine community Sports Bar & Grill.  Definitly a Locals Favorite and all 3 times the crowd was Fun & Mixed; mixed Age Group also.. Talking to the Waitresses and my buddy who took me there the frist time, most have been working there since for the past 2-3 years and that's a good sign. I CANNOT see how ANYBODY can complain about the prices!  Plus the "old style" Happy Hour.  1-3pm Beer's are a BUCK!  3-6 or 7(I forget) FREE Happy Hour Layout? Who does that anymore in Phoenix:  Wings, Chili they make  (I'm told) and Sweedish Meatball! The happy hours prices were mixed.. They were something like $2, $4 & $5 HOWEVER I DO NOT REMEMBER!  I Could be wrong: Call & Find out.  Also, this is off the Hook:  In the mornings (Weekends but call and check for days, I think 7 days a week) FREE BREAKFAST WITH ONE DRINK:  A Regular Sit Down Breakfast with Eggs, Potatos, Saugage & Bacon, Toast? -- I HAVE NOT been there yet fior this but I'm told they literally just serve everybody automatically:  All you can Eat.  AT NIGHT AFTER 10PM:  $3 YOU CALL " EVERYTHING "  My buddy gets Tangaray's!   Beers, you name It, it's $3!   So who ever said in that other review that Jimbo's is really expensive, I'd have to ask what town is he talkin' about!  My favorit part of it was the friendly and Mixxed Crowd.  There were 20somthings all over. Ther were baby boomers and I saw people hookin' up.  Outside Smoking area.  I mean,  I dig Salty's in Glendale/Arrowhead and lot's of places around the greater city.  Toby Keiths in Mesa for Country, Killer Food & Music if you like Country.  Jimbo's is right up there on the West Side for the Sports Crowd.  Killer big screens and the small one's you'd expect.  I thought it far "Warmer" then, say, Santori Brothers on Bell & the 17 (name) in the Bell Canyon strip mall... And it's in a great part of town!  Enjoy
1	This is your regular North Side run down divey sports bar, except It smells weird and I always get severely congested in there.(I wonder if they have a mold problem.) It's a  really big place, there is a wall of TVs and it's usually pretty full. Also, they serve free hot wings during happy hour, so if you're into that...I don't like it, because I don't like sports and I like background music when I'm drinking. Plus I've seen some obnoxious drunks in there and never anyone slightly hip, which is fine, but... well, it is what it is.I would give 2 or 3 stars, but often the bartenders have attitude. No matter how friendly I am or how much I try to get on their good side with good tips, asking them how they are doing, etc. they still kind of act rude. There's one girl in particular, but I can't remember her name. She wears glasses, has dark hair and is pale. She will purposely ignore me and help all the men at the bar instead. It may be a silly gripe, but that's  the reason I haven't gone back. I like friendly neighborhood places.
3	Jimbo's is just ok for me. PROS: Good prices on drinks and food.Shuffleboard tableDartsBig Screen TVsCONS:Very LOUD! The music is way too loud and makes it hard to chat with friends.Often has strange people - not sure what it is but I always seem to encounter at least one crazy person every time I am thereOK service but sometimes slow. The servers are super nice - you just have to wait a bit sometimes.It is a place to go once in a while for a hole-in-the-wall neighborhood bar with good prices but not necessarily someplace I would go when planning a night with friends who I want to be able to chat with.
5	Love this place!
3	Come for the free breakfast, stay cause you shouldn't be driving in your condition anyways!  Place is dark, with typical "less than fresh" bar odor, but has friendly staff and a ton of TVs.  It's fine for what it is (a place to drink), but I wouldn't bring anyone here on a first date.
5	FUN!  Friendly atmosphere... Facebook with beer... make friends you never knew ... Boarding House seating, find an empty stool and meet some folks. FREE Breakfast! not AN egg but 2-3 eggs, 2 sausage links, 2 bacon strips, hash browns and toast! All for the price of a drink.  Large mug of Beer, Bloody Mary, Screwdriver or Diet Soda any for $5 (hint: the soda has free refills) or anything else your morning taste-buds want.. Full bar. To top it off the guy taking food orders and probably delivering the food owns the joint!  Not many places have a truly hands-on owner that actually works!   Done with Breakfast?  Stick around for Happy hour. Now a buffet with wings, nachos, and other goodies.  Menu varies per day. SPORT FANS!!   More TV's that Best Buy.  4 Roll-down projector TV's that cover 6 dart boards during football. Also more than a dozen HD big screens around the building! Pool Tables?  Yes. // Dart Board? Yes (see note above) // Shuffleboard?  Yep // Golden Tee?  YES! Staff is friendly even when busy. Sometimes patience is needed because the place stays packed!
2	Food was great, service sucked
3	Free Breakfast!!! Yeah it is hard to beat that but it's still a dive bar. Pretty dark inside. Let's just say it's the perfect place on a Saturday morning if you want the hair of the dog that bit you.
5	Great place to have a beer, free breakfast, and watch a game.  I love going here and playing darts.  Staff knows me on a first name basis and remembers what I drink.. Kudos to a great local bar
1	Decided to head on over because my brother invited me to watch the Packers beat Dallas.  It was free wing day at 03:pm to which we realized at that time when they started giving them out.. **FIRST TIME EVER IN THE JOINT**  I sent my son over to fetch some wings while watching the game and he took a few extra because we were gonna share a plate.  While my 15 year old son was getting the wings, the owner comes over and yells at my son to not take so much and proceeded to call him a pig.  Then the owner comes over to my table to replace the paper towels.  I asked why you were yelling at my son and he said because he's a pig.  I said he was getting a few extra because were sharing.  He continued to tell me to my face that my son is a pig and then adds fat pig, so therefore I returned fire with a plate of wings to the owners head and left....ha  In the mean time hitting a few patrons with flying wings that were in the line of fire to which I apologize for to those patrons..  I give this place 0 stars although im rating it as 1 star to make this post.. I feel sorry for anyone who thinks this place is a great esablishment to drink and eat.  Hold on, I wouldn't even call this place an establishment  The owner is a total lowlife and feel sorry for anyone who works for him.  Extremely rude.  I will make sure none of my friends go to this dive bar and will spread the word.  I suggest to Stay away from this place if you don't like getting ridiculed and insulted upon by the owner..  It's a nuisance to the neighborhood.   ************************STAY AWAY**********************There are some things that I do agree with other posts on this subject such as, Jimbo's is definately not a place for kids and I wish I had realized that before I decided to go there.   It was more imature for this 60 year old man to tell a 15 year old that he is a fat pig when people in line are cheering him on to take more wings and then proceed to come over to my table to change out a paper towel roll knowing what had just occurred(almost like he was instigating a fight).  This is where the real imatureness really begins.  Now that I know not to take my son to this so called "adult Themed Bar"...ha(more like alcoholic themed Bar), I myself and many others to whom i'm good friends with will not be going to this bar as well.
5	I come here every week and I love the staff the food and the owner. The food is great the breakfast is amazing and I don't know where else you can get the food quality that they serve for nothing. Can't wait to come in. Love my weeks that I get to see everyone.
4	I belong to a dart league sponsored by Jimbos. The bar staff was excellent. The drink prices were on par and the captain and coke was good. They were offerig free food for the Thursday night football. Wings, chili and meatballs. I only had the wings and they were great. (free)There were plenty of TV's to watch the games and they even have pull down screens to add a few more.
5	I have been going to Jimbo's for years.  The staff is friendly.  The prices are competitive/fair. And free food with drink purchase (free breakfast 8a.m-12p.m. free wings 3p.m-6p.m) is a definite bonus! I've read the negative comments and I have never been treated that way. I would refer anybody to go. Jimbo's is a great, fun place that is clean with lots of big screens, 7 dart boards and plenty of seating. Also have 3 pool tables with a nice outdoor patio. And fyi a really hot and bad ass staff.
3	Great food but service sucks. Make sure you know what you want before the waitress comes because you won't see her for another 20 mins
4	In town for a fun weekend and a buddy took me here for a morning cocktail and a bit of food. The free breakfast with your purchase of a drink is awesome. The menu is simple and to the point. "Scrambled or regular eggs" and you get a big helping of hash browns, toast, sausage and bacon. Drinks were strong and crowd was good. 4 stars. Service could have been a bit faster. Overall highly suggest this place if you are looking for a quick drink!
5	Good size neighborhood bar, kind of dark, but welcoming. Yes, they do have wifi. Ask for the password.  From my seat at the bar I could see fourteen TV screens, all showing sports.  There are three pool tables, and eight dart boards. Waitresses are cute.  And OMG they have hard cider in tap!  I just stopped in for lunch and it wasn't loud music at all, just background music.  It was a Tuesday and the place was surprisingly well attended for a Tuesday lunch time.  Nice little place. I will go back.
5	Love this place!, Lisa our waitress was very polite,and hr customer service was great! She answered any questions that we may have had.The wings were the bomb! I ordered them extra crispy,and buy god they were!and tasted great!the sauce was good not a over powering vinegar taste like most places when they try to get them hot.Now there hot was not hot! But a good taste,I took my two daughters,5 and 7 yrs old and they enjoyed themselves very much twirling in circles on the seats,.and eating the huge chicken fingers,there food is pretty big  so two people could share it to save a little money,drinks were all 5.00 dollars and then you got free food! From the buffet ,My wife ordered the wine burger,which she liked very much she said.We will  be going back, The free wings start at 3:00 till 6:00 or 7:00pm and  breakfast starts at 8am till noon, which is also free with a drink.I'm not a drinker,so I had one drink which was good enough for me.Thanks Lisa for all your help and the way you treated us.so Sunday football here we come,our new neighborhood place to enjoy ourselves!
5	My favorite bar. Great staff, good food...AWESOME wings!!! I always tell people to go here. I hadn't been in a couple of mths and when I went in again, they had remodeled and made it more open. Love it!
5	Ok, so for those of you who know me you know I don't frequent bars (of any kind) rarely drink and pretty much stay to myself. Found out Dwight Knox is the new owner here and last night we were talking about the FREE breakfast he serves Everyday. I was helping my sister out this morning and decided to stop by. Holy cow! This is amazingly good. All the games on clear TV and yes and the place was jumping! Doing a good thing Dwight! Keep up the good work.  Former Moon Valley and Apollo Alum are the owners!
4	Great wings , and the breakfast is pretty good also .the Cook does a great job on the food . I don't drink so I can't say anything about that but over all a good neighborhood place .
5	This place is the bomb. Free breakfast every day. It's a real breakfast too. 3 eggs, sausage, bacon, hash browns, toast. TVs everywhere. If you're still hungry, they'll give you another. Love this place.
