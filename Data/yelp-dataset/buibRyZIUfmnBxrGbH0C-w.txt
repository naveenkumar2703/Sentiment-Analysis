5	She is the best!  I'd call her before you call anyone else
5	Got a ticket going 11 miles over in a construction zone! Plus no proof of ins ( wasn't my car couldn't fine it). Bill was $1433! Called ticket lady, spoke to very helpful staff. They got it reduced to illegal parking $195, no points, no traffic school, no proof of ins dismissed!! I'm very happy & have already recommend them to people. Saved me money & time. Hassle free! They even called & sent letter letting me know the outcome. Very fair fee for their awesome service:)
1	I wouldn't do business with this law firm even if it was the last traffic ticket lawyer on earth. I rather pay the fee and go to traffic school then have them rip me off. It's the principle that's important to me. To make a long story short, basically the customer service representative I dealt with was really hard to get on the phone and there technology are old (I had to request using e-mails as a faster way to communicate, they just deal with faxing. They don't have a system that will keep you posted on your case. I don't know if they even have a website). Well back to the review, I initially talked to a representative and she told me it will be around $250-$300 dollars because I wanted to budget my finances then the next time I talked to her, she gave me a different quote of $300-$400 dollars. Now, I think she wouldn't do that on purpose but that's just poor business practice keeping track of new potential customer's conversations. Therefore, I took my business to a different law firm that I can trust.
