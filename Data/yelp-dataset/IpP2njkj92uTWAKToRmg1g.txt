1	Chuy's food is as great as it usually is.  When I lived in Ca, I Chuy's was a regular haunt because the food has need awesome since the original days.  But the service at this particular resturaunt is inexcusable.  One person was given the wrong food.  Mistakes happen... But the manager (who made the mistake on the order) refused to fix it, and actually insisted the person in our party that got the wrong food ordered it that way.  Her argument was that the customer ordered a dinner they hated and she was not going to fix it.Great food, when they get the order right.  But service is so bad, you will be best served going elsewhere.
3	I went with the "famous sliders", which were pretty decent.  Not high quality burgers, but not bad.  Chips and salsa were ok, and the fries weren't bad.  Their Chuy's brand barbecue sauce was surprisingly good - probably good enough to compete with the national brands (assuming it isn't already a re-label of an existing brand).I don't think I'd make a special trip out there, but I'd probably consider stopping in again if the opportunity arose.
5	Good happy hour from 3-6pm great menu for a sports bar had the Arizona burger it definitely did not disappoint drinks are free pour so they are good
