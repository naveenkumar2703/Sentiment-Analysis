2	They have moved and I think I am glad.The last time I went in, I was trying to find out where they were moving. The owner started complaining about  something like she always does. (I have gone there mostly for convience of  buying live  mice for my snake)I have found  Tropical Treasures on West Bell and 27 th  are more helpful.
2	This store is now located at 4219 W Thunderbird Rd Phoenix, AZ. Amazon is a decent small pet store. It has a kind of grimy look to the whole store, but they had a pretty good selection of reptiles and fish. They also had all of the normally available feeders. There were almost no pet supplies available for purchase.They have a cool Gray Parrot behind the check out counter that will talk from time to time.
3	They have a decent selection of your usual freshwater and a few saltwater fish. Not much merchandise to select from but the owner greeted me promptly and was pretty helpful. I bought 3 blue ram juveniles. All seem very healthy and free of the deformities I've seen elsewhere. Would be cool if she had more plants and what not but overall I had a good experience.
1	I have tried to check this place out 5 different times now during times that their window schedule says they are supposed to be open and every time I go down there the place is closed. Im not sure how they stay in business when they are never open. Now I'm to the point that its not worth wasting the gas to go to this store since chances are that they wont be open when I get there.
