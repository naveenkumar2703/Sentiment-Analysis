5	I am extremely happy with my new hair extensions.  Scheduling was super easy and convenient.  Installation was faster than anticipated and completely painless.Carmen is a true professional.
5	I visited Glam Live shortly after they opened with my 8 year old son.  He and I were desperately in need of hair cuts!!  Carmen was great!!  She did a fantastic job of getting my son to sit still and be patient while she cut his hair.  This has been a challenge in the past with other barbers/stylists.  She then cut my hair, and did an excellent job of giving me exactly the look I wanted.   My son and I both walked out looking much, much better than when we walked in!!  I'd highly recommend Glam Live Creative Studio for anyone who wants to feel better about how they look!
5	I love doing hair and building my own brand along with such a good team. Come experience our culture and fall in love with our style.
5	My first visit and I was not disappointed. Carmen did an AMAZING job, and her skill is so crafted! She did exactly what I asked for and made it even better than what I was expecting! Definitely coming back and will recommend to anyone who asks me.
