2	I used to like Yi, but as of today I will not be going back there ever again. I brought in an $800 bathing suit (it was a gift) to be tailored so that I could resell it. It was brand new with the tags still on, but just had some threads that were coming apart. I came back today to pick it up and the tags were completely gone. I explained to him (and a woman there behind the counter who spoke better English than he) that there were 2 tags on it; the regular tag with the barcode and one that held thread for the bathing suit. Both were MIA. Instead of saying "I'm sorry" he blamed me and said I must have taken them off or lost them which is ridiculous. I was going to resell it on eBay, I didn't touch the tags and never would have taken them off. Anyway, I won't be going back. I'll be taking my business somewhere else.The reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because the tailoring was good, but losing my tags and then blaming me is unacceptable.
