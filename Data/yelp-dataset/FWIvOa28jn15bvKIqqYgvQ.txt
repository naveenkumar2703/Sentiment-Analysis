3	This is a great little park in North Scottsdale. I love it because it is so close to my house and during peak times there are some great dogs for Milly to play with. Two drawbacks of the park are that there are not any lights, and that it is half dirt, so humans and pups get very dirty.
4	Great dog park. Lot's of friendly dogs and owners. I sometimes go early in the morning before the energy level of the park gets too high for my new rescue Joey.  As a new family member, my dog needs training and some work on her social skills, and the regulars at Horizon have all been very patient with us. The afternoons can get a bit rowdy, but if you completely trust your dog it's safe to assume that your pup will be safe here.
3	A few times each week I come here to enjoy my breakfast and coffee in the early morning.  It's peaceful and relaxing and fun.  Try it sometimes.
4	I was spoiled living next door to the Chapparal Dog Park for several years. However, this is now my local spot and luckily it is still a well maintained hangout with water, shade, and pick-up tools. Though, it only offers a single large space for all dogs.
4	This is a good sized park in North Scottsdale that offers a little bit for everyone. I like the sand volleyball areas, its never too packed. The bball courts are well kept and I would definitely bring a dog here if I had one. The place has pretty good upkeep.
4	Now that they actually put fresh sod down and the park is half grass and dirt, rather than all dirt - I like this park! So nice to have a place for the pup to run and socialize that is close to home. It is a one-size fits all park so the big dogs and small dogs share the same space. There is some nice shaded seating for the parents, pooper scoopers to help when you need it, and a couple of dog (and human) drinking fountains. It is not as big or fancy as Chaparral dog park, but the dogs still love it. Thank you City of Scottsdale for providing a cool dog park (and fixing the grass!)
4	This park is nicely fenced in with a "sally port" (prison reference) type entry system... so dogs cannot accidental run out. My dogs love it here... I guess that's all that counts! :)It seems recently that they are trying to do some new improvement... its also really hot... so its hard to keep up the grass... especially with dogs running all over it. It's big enough for the dogs to have a blast... but not to big to keep on eye on things. I have been here a dozen times or so... and have never had any issues with other dogs being to aggressive.
4	Excellent compact park. It has all facilities like dog park, basketball and volley ball courts and friendly kids playground too. Well maintained park with wifi now. I love to take my evening walks here.
2	Walkable for me and my pup, so that's good, but it is dusty and the little grass that is there just isn't great. It's not a large space and does tend to get overtaken by large, rambunctious dogs. Usually all well-behaved, but I'm just a nervous dog mom who thinks my little guy is going to get pummeled!
3	A nice little dog park that has benches, picnic tables, shade, and water.Most of the park is dirt with grass around the perimeter.  I'd rather see the opposite, more grass than dirt.  People don't seem to pick up after their dogs as I went around with the pooper scooper and picked up 3 large loads of waste without even trying.  Several waste bins are provided with several pooper scoopers available for patrons.  Waste bags are also provided near the entrances.Access is via double gates to keep dogs from escaping.I liked the bowls built into the ground that are fed with water bubbling up from below with which dogs can get a drink.
4	This is a great dog park for locals. I've read about the dust concerns but most visitors don't realize that there is actually a dust control sprinkler that you can activate that sprinkles just enough water to keep the dust down but not cause dirty/muddy feet (human and K9)!There are two separate fenced areas but they seem to rotate and keep one open while the other recovers, grows grass, etc. There are the usual dog park dog behavior issues which are usually kept to a minimum.  Overall even mix of large and small dogs. The human mix is also common. Almost everyone is friendly and sociable. Most are responsible about their pets behavior. There is a slight "Scottsdale" factor, but if you are going to this dog park then you're likely from Scottsdale and adjusted to that way of life and attitude. Overall a great thumbs up. Well maintained and convenient dog park with great dogs and great people. Only advice- avoid after substantial rain and storms - it will be muddy for a couple of days.
1	A very low class of owners hangs out at horizon. They have aggressive dogs, yet they think they're angels. Too many owners think they own the park. They bring a ball and get upset if dogs other than their own Chase it. Really? And beware the east coast cane guy. He'll verbally, and loudly, attack you knowing you can't give him what he deserves because he's old.
3	This park is attractive and has plenty of seating and interesting things for the dog to explore. Unfortunately it doesn't have much use. Without dog society I don't see much point to a dog park. It isn't open a lot (or that is how it appears to me) which may affect use. Or maybe it is the other way around. Parking is good.
4	Nice park with some friendly people.  All in all we had a blast.  This is within walking distance from my apartment and the park itself is nestled behind an apartment complex. I appreciated the volume of people here and there were a lot of well mannered pups as well.  Be prepared to come with some rough and tuff clothes because you WILL get dirty.My doberman and I hope on making this our regular go-to dog park.  We had a blast and look forward to many many more visits.
4	This dog park is so close by and there are some great people and dogs that come here. My puppy has been coming here since she was 3 months (now 7 mo) and she has so much fun playing with the other puppies and dogs! We've had 2 bad experiences here with dogs getting a little rough but for the most part everyone watches their dogs and has good dog park etiquette!  The park is not very well maintained (mostly dirt and grass patches) but it is fun for the pups and gets the job done!
3	This is a pretty small dog park, with only one area for all dogs backed up next to a baseball field. My husband and I used to go to this dog park all the time when he lived over there, but now I only go occasionally when I choose to bring my pup to work and we both need a break for lunch. The people have always been nice, but the grounds have not always been kept up.I understand that it's a dog park and it will get messed up from time-to-time, especially in the summer, but a little upkeep would be nice. They recently "remodeled" it, but I don't see much difference, besides them reseeding the grass and taking out grass in half of the area. Not sure why they would take out the grass, as now it is dirt/mud/sand, and your pups are SURE to need a bath once you leave. I will come back to this park because it is the closest one to my work, but other than that there is really no other reason for us to come here. We have driven past this park to go to Chaparral Dog Park because it is much nicer, although we would prefer to come to this one because of proximity. Oh well!
5	This is a great little dog park, usually half the park is grass and the other half is dirt. Lots of people use this park so at any given time there should be plenty of pups for your pups to play with. It's also right next to Horizon Park, so there's lots of other stuff to walk around and see with your pups.
4	Horizon dog park is not the nicest dog park I've ever been to, but I really enjoy bringing my dog here because it is always quiet and fun! I am honestly very particular on where I bring my dogs because of germs and aggressive behavior between dogs. So far I have not run into any problems and have been very satisfied with taking my dogs here.
