5	I've been going here for many years, Bill the original owner gave great cuts and the new owner Todd does a great job too... You won't be disappointed
5	Great shop - A fine haircut plus all the positive aspects of old time service and more.  A+ for the Buckeye Barber!  Todd carries on the tradition on Buckeye Rd.As for the lack of Sat. hours there must be a shop open in ChiTown that will  do your hair before you come visit cheddarland.  Spare us please!
