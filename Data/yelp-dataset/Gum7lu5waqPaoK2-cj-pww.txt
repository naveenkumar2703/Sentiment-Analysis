5	I am not usually a big fan of chiropractic treatments, but my coworker told me i had to go see Brian Gamett DC because he was so helpful to her in treating her neck pain.  My back froze up at work and she made an apointment for me during lunch.  I came back feeling like a new man.  Thanks!
5	I did A LOT of research prior to choosing a chiropractor and I am so glad I choose Dr. Gamett.  Everyone in the office is very friendly and anytime I need to get in the same day they have no problem fitting me in.  I have suffered from back and neck pain for years and Dr. Gamett has seriously helped me see some relief, after years of my GP throwing pain killers and muscle relaxers at me.  He doesn't pressure you to return unless he believes that another visit is necessary, at which time he will ask you if it works for you to return on a certain day.  Listen to your body and if you think you need an adjustment then just call and make an appointment and they are happy to help you out.  When I managed to hurt neck doing a face plant in the river off of a kneeboard while on vacation, he didn't admonish me, just asked if I had fun and then got to work fixing me!  Everyone in the office genuinely cares about you and your health and I would strongly suggest this practice.
5	Dr. Gamett is awesome!  I had a very hard pregnancy, I had a big baby and a very small frame which made for a lot of aches and pains.  My hip would hurt so bad that I could barely stand it.  I went in and he adjusted it for me and the relief was literally instant.  Just like the other reviewer said, he never was pushy about coming back, he always said to give it a few days and come back if I felt I needed it and when I needed it.  Thankfully I've not needed him a whole lot but when I do, I'm so glad that he can help!
