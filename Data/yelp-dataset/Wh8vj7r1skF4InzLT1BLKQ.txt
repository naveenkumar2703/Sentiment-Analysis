3	This medium sized pharmacy on Elm Row is definitely notBoots or Superdrug! They've got an interesting range of products available, and though you can get your basic medicine and toiletries, they also stock some fancy cosmetics and perfumes! I'm a big fan of Boots as they have hardly ever failed me, but a friend needed to buy something so we ended up at the much closer Lindsay and Gilmour.The store has quite a few luxury brands, such as La Roche Posay, and I was particularly distracted by their display of Bomb Cosmetics. I'm not entirely sold on the functionality of such products, but they were very pretty to look at!
