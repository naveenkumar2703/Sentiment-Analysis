1	No one on the print staff could figure out how to print a PDF document 4-to-a-sheet. The employee turned the computer toward me and said, "Here, be my guest, figure it out yourself," and then walked away. Seriously???
3	These stores are HUGE and there's never anyone in them. How they stay in biz is beyond me. Any who, there were plenty of workers around to try to help me find an anti-glare screen for my lappy 5000, but it turns out they do not sell this product anymore. Boo. Need a sharpie or a binder? Come here. Need anything beyond that? Call Amazon.
