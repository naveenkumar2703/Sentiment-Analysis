2	They do a pretty good job, but honestly, the blond woman who i believes owns the place is pretty rude and not very friendly. Next time I plan to drive a bit farther and go to Cobblestone which actually is a little cheaper anyway.
3	Quick - Cheap - Friendly I drove up and they took my car wash order. I needed a quick, basic wash, so I got the 7 dollar one. They have a 5 dollar option too. The attendant guided me into the machine and it went to work. It gave a pretty thorough cleaning, but my car was still fairly wet at the end. If you get the higher end washes, you're directed left so more attendants can finish the job. For the cheap washes (like mine), you turn right where there are several stations to dry your car. Many cars looked like they had been left in the stations for their owners to pick up. Some guys just parked right outside the machine and appeared to be using their own towels. Whatever the case, there wasn't any room for me to park and I had no towels. Good thing Scottsdale road is 50mph to help dry me off!
5	15 bucks for an interior and exterior wash. The best part was that they refrained from trying to up sell me on stuff I didn't want or need, just took my money and sent me through.
1	Don't waste your money folks!  Spent $10 on a wash & car was still dirty & Lot's of bugs left on front end. Had to go home & re wash/clean car!!
4	Seriously, I've had a 5 buck car wash and a 70 buck inside outside and they were good and exactly what I expected. I go once a week. Dear god, it's a car wash not a Thai massage parlor
