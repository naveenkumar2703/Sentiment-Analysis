4	found it across from gate 9 at sky harbor.Ethiopian brew of the day made me a fan.Cream cheese danish was not too sweet and fair value.
4	:-) GRRRRReat vanilla latte
3	Stopped in at their location at Terminal 2 near gate 9 prior to my flight. The service was quick and professional and there was not a line. Iced or hot yoy will be pleased with quality typical of the chain.
5	Oh how I love Coffee Bean!  I love their Hot Vanilla and the staff at this location is super friendly and quick to make your drink!
4	very good coffee, quick service, and a lot of selection.  THis was a great coffee stop at the Phoenix Airport.
1	You would do better walking across the hallway to Wendy's and getting coffee there. The Coffee Bean had no customers in line yet I had to wait 6 minutes to be waited on. While waiting I noticed they sell cans of chocolate powder topper to take home, but do you think they could put any out for customers who just purchased a large expensive cappuccino? You guest it NO. Maybe the chocolate powder would have helped improve the taste of their bitter coffee. Yuk! Just a captive audience.
