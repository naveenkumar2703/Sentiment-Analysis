4	Very nice irish bar in Waterloo! Beer's not too expensive (about 15$ for a pitcher), good atmosphere. You have musicians coming to perform in the evening, it really adds a nice touch to the place.It's a good pub to come when you're with friends!
4	Molly's is a great place to come hang out with friends if you're looking to just chill. Whether you want to watch the game on TV, or take in the live music they often have, you'll enjoy yourself here.
2	Sorry, Molly Bloom's. I was a fan, and then I went back for a second time, and the waitress was just super rude. The burgers were fine, the drinks were fine, but she really took away from the experience I was hoping to have with friends. The good: fun place to hang out.The bad:...unless the waitress is mean.
