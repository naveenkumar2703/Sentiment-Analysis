5	awesome shop.quick turn around!
5	Ordered a couple of basic rockers, owner told me they would be ready next week.  When I asked if they were open on Saturday, he said if I couldn't get there during the week he could meet me there on Saturday. Wish all businesses had such a customer focused attitude.
5	Wa a looking for a place to get an apron embroidered, and found this shop. Absolutely fabulous customer service, and a very quick turn around. We have already had lettering put on two jerseys, as well as the apron embroidered. All items look fabulous, and the prices are very fair! Will use Phoenix lettering for all of our lettering/embroidering needs from now on!
5	There's no better word to describe Courtney and the Phoenix Lettering team then AMAZING.I spent a week driving around town and making phone calls trying to find someone in Phoenix that could place USA in tackle twill across the back of a jacket for my trip to Sochi for the Winter Olympics. Courtney not only was quick to respond, she also made me feel like this one item was just as important to her as a full team's uniform or letter jacket order. That kind of customer service seems hard to find these days and Phoenix Lettering definitely earned my future business and the business of anyone I can refer to them. As for the end result... Perfect! I'll post a picture of the jacket keeping me warm in the mountain cluster while watching our Team USA athletes win the gold!Kyle
