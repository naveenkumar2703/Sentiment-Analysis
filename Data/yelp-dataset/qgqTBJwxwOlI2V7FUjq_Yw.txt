4	Jerk Chicken Rice Bowl - takeoutI went over lunchtime.  My order took over 15 minutes to fill.  I'd give a lower rating, but the food is tremendous.  I'll definitely be back.  The place closes at 8PM.
4	I've been to Saboten twice and it was very good.  It's basic fair, nothing special, but done very well. Basic noodle or rice-bowl type dishes, some sushi, etc.  The biggest draw is that it is locally owned and has very reasonable prices. My wife and I recently went there for a quick dinner and had two entres and an order of sushi for under $20.
1	Closed! big fat greek express now!
