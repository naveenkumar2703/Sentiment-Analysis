4	Not much differentiates this Walgreens from all the others. It does have a drive-through pharmacy, but it's not open 24 hours. The photo counter staff is ridiculously grumpy, but otherwise the staff have been quite friendly. It's clean, never too busy, and the only drugstore in the area.
5	I  love the pharmacy staff at this location. They've been incredibly helpful, friendly, and accommodating- I have HIV and not just any pharmacy can properly handle dispensing the medication I require. The Pharmacists have been very helpful in regards to changes with my insurance coverage, as well as providing information regarding the drugs I do take. They've never let me down, and I am 100% satisfied with this location in particular. Also, the new Walgreens app for smart phone is extra super awesome, and makes life SOO easy. Woo.
4	They always well stocked on my Magnums.I don't like the old biddy, but they got some cuties working here, too.
