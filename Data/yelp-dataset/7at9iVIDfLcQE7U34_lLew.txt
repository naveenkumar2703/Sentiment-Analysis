5	I have never been a fan of big, intimidating gyms, which is why this location is perfect!  I have been coming to this gym for the last 2 months and I must say it is perfect for me.  I have been working out with a personal trainer, and almost every time I come in, there are only a few people.  I love this because not everyone has to see me work out :) The location is great because it is near my house, and so far everyone seems nice that I have encountered.  Meets all of my expectations in a gym.
5	Love working out here, I really enjoy this location. It is quiet and peaceful and I don't feel weird or uncomfortable working out here. The people here are very friendly. A much more hands on experience especially working with a personal trainer, rather then going to the over priced larger gyms. I work out here 3 times a week.
5	Anytime Fitness is a great gym and their personal trainers are awesome! Having never had a trainer before,  I was a little intimidated. But I have to say that they made me feel so comfortable. My trainer Dave is amazing, and what I really like about this gym is that it's so personalized. I highly recommend going to Anytime Fitness!!
5	I have been a member here for about 4 months now and absolutely love it. I'm not a huge fan of gym chains because of the people they tend to attract( guys flexing in mirrors and girls in full hair and makeup) but Anytime Fitness has broken that mold. There have never been more than a handful of people every time I go, and everyone has been very polite and respectful. I will be a long time member.
5	Very Nice gym. Very Clean and affordable. 24 hour Entry.Nice Staff.
