1	Marketing-only:  greenwash and healthy-washed, really just a lackluster meal with a hefty pricetag that isn't that green or healthy.  Styrofoam cup anyone???
4	I went in with two other guys and noticed that the name of the place is actually Fresh 'n Fast now. There were just a handful of people despite it being lunch time. I ended up ordering the black bean burger and a fruit cup. The place might have fresh food, but it certainly was not fast. The black bean burger was pretty tasty though. It was a little spicy, which was a nice twist.The fruit cup included watermelon, cantaloupe, pineapple, and strawberries. All but the strawberries were good.
3	I've been spoiled with good healthy foods in health freak Los Angeles.This place is good, but it's just that A-OK. I mean I feel like if this was fantastic food for this price then people would maybe realize fresh, healthy is very tasty and can be fast foods and it would be a hit. I like it but getting a combo is like $10-12 and I dont see how this will work for just good enough to satisfy people looking for good food and don't really care if it's healthy or not. Healthy food goers- probably find this place wonderful though as it's slim pickins in this town. I enjoy their airbaked fries and chicken. I like that they have flavored ketchup. Their black bean and turkey burgers are good. Their smoothies are good and its not as fatty as a smoothie at the usual places.3.5 stars
