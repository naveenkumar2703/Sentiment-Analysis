4	It is a new location in Waterloo. Personally, we haven't been to any of their other locations, so we can't compare.The diner's interior did not look like...well, how a diner usually looks like. It is a bit classier with duller colours as opposed to the bright yellow/red diners we've been to. It is a spacious restaurant with booths and a bar. It is located next to Comfort Inn. There was a host at the front who greeted us with a big smile on her face, and seated us promptly with both the breakfast and lunch menus. They checked back regularly and always with a smile. They took the initiative to bring out extra plates when they realized we were sharing. But the restaurant only seated 3 other tables or so; unsure whether they would be as observing when it is busier. The portions were big. Well, huge and really cheap for what you get. We ordered an entree special (13 oz. rib steak, comes with soup or salad, and 2 sides) for $17.95 and an egg as a side order for $1.50. We were both perfectly stuffed afterwards. We got cesar salad, french fries and vegetables which all turned out pretty good. The french fries were perfect actually :D crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The steak though, was overcooked. Asked for medium-rare and they give us medium (only faintly pink). But even though it was overcooked, the steak was decent.We would recommend dropping by here if you live near or just happen to be around. Just that for us, we had to walk a lot because no buses would us straight to it.
5	Deluxe meat sandwich with fries rocks, ok prices and great service makes this place 5 stars in my book. A must in your in the area
2	Bad food.  Ate here all week while on a work trip.  Seriously chain-tastic feeling food.  The portions are pretty big, but I really didn't like anything I had for breakfast or dinner.  The service was great.
