4	I had never been to a Sonic before. I have seen the commercials on TV and have always wanted to try them. Finally got my chance when we were driving back to the airport, our last stop before leaving Las Vegas. We ordered our meal through the little speaker. The kid on roller skates!! came out with our food. Roller skates!!I ordered a cheeseburger without the burger. However it came without the cheese as well. The vanilla shake I ordered was the highlight. My husband had one of their coffee shakes, I think that was better than mine. Definitely will order that one next time! Ugh, but man! It was SO hot, we couldn't eat our food in the car. And sitting outside wasn't any better either!
4	Just got a shake and a strawberry lemonade slushy. I made it to happy hour and paid half off.
4	Great stop  for a quickie lunch... Love the Cherry Lime-aid and the  Chocolate with Bacon shakes are AWESOME The Chicago dog is okay not the best I've had but I won't choke on it either..
