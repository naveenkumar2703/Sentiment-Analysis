3	$5 for a footlong is a darn good deal. Just note that the subs are much, much thinner than in the pictures, so I would suggest asking for double the meat, cheese, or whatever you want. The toasted subs are my fave. (I'm not too fond of cold sandwiches.) I like that they make it front of you. Half of the sub will fill you up, so the $5 foot long is actually good for two meals. The food isn't fabulous, but if you are budget conscious, you can get your money's worth here.I don't have a favorite, but my boyfriend loves the Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki sub.I've been here about 3 times and the customer service has been good every time.
3	This Subway is around the corner from my house and I just found it after living in the neighborhood for 3 1/2 yrs!  It's located in a non-descript building kind of set back from the road next to the 7-11, which is probably why I've never noticed it before.Anyway, I ordered my usual 12" BMT toasted w/Green Peppers, Mustard, Mayo, Onions, Salt/Pepper, Oregano, Oil, Vinegar, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Provolone.  The Sandwich Artist did an OK job with the Sammie....she went a little light on the Veggies, so that was the only downside to it.Overall, an OK experience at Subway.  Glad I found one so close to home!Return Factor - 80%
2	My 7 year old thinks this place is the bomb.  However, I beg to differ.  Their slogan is eat fresh but I look through the glass at the fixins and wonder if Fresh is the right word.  Not to mention their cold cuts look like they have more fillers and preservatives than actual meat.Some things are good as they do have a lot of choices but I would stay away from the limp bacon or chicken sandwiches.  In a pinch this is edible but there are many better sandwich shops to choose from in the area.  For kids, the "fit meal" works well and comes with a little subway bag.  Chip and drink choices are limited but they have great cookies. Try the white chocolate raspberry!
