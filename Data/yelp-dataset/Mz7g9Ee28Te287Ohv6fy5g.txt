2	This Comfort Inn is just a place to lay your head for a night's sleep in North Las Vegas. Located along a busy thoroughfare, it is especially difficult in the morning commute hours to make a left on Cheyenne Avenue to go east toward the freeway. The Inn is clean and simple. The room air conditioners are exceptionally noisy. The complimentary breakfast is the same at all the Comfort Inns: cold cereal, instant oatmeal, fruit, breads (all white), hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, juices and coffee/tea.
1	The front man is such a GREAT actor who can act like they care us, who booked the room 2months ago.Yet, made us stay in a BROKEN door room...even they have an extra room, they didn't switch the room..WOW..yes, I called from cellphone asking if they have a room available & they said yes....Very shocked....zero star. period.  Amazing that they have nerve to make guest stay in a room with broken door & BROKEN AC( ....actually found out it was not broken...)...speechless
1	This hotel gets 1 star because it's not possible to give no stars or negative stars.  Dirty everything.  Booked 2 nights but checked out after 1.  Would have checked out immediately upon seeing the room but it was after 9 pm.
