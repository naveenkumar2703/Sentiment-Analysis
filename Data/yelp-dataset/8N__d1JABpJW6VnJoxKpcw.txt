5	Great breakfast options and the underage teenage employees were a typical kids with their first jobs. They both tried so hard to make sure we were happy and we were!On a side note they are right on the water so sitting on the patio is refreshing if you get their early. The birds/flying rodents love the crumbs you flip to them. The lake is full of carp and my GF tried to feed a duck and was shocked as well as amazed at how many fished came over (couple hundred) it was like an episode of "when animals attack"She was having so much fun feeding the fish she wanted to buy a loaf of bread for the next morning.
4	Perfect little breakfast spot. During the staycation it was just a short walk from the hotel. This is a very small cafe with minimal indoor seating. I had the corned beef hash and eggs. Pretty yummy. They use real chunks of corned beef not the canned stuff. It was very well seasoned. It was a chilly morning so we sat inside. However, I would like to come back and enjoy the outdoor seating overlooking the lake. The young man working was polite and efficient.
1	If you're looking for the great local breakfast and brunch joint... This isn't it. I'm not a particular person, but this doesn't beat making your own breakfast at home.There are very few food options. The muffins are out of plastic packaging. Our French toast was burnt on the edges and mushy in the middle.The view and area would be nice except the place isn't too well kept, and that means bird poop on the tables/chairs and some annoying flies.
3	Walked in and no one to be seen. Open boxes and products all over the front counter. I could see the cool but no one acknowledged us. Finally a frazzled woman walked in and took our order. Not sure if it's a new business or they were short staffed but definitely not prepared and unorganized. The food itself wasn't bad. Had the veggie breakfast wrap. If you need food without the frills or customer service stop on in.
