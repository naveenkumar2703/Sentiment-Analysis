4	Right next to the super awesome amazing Indian place is Big Burger. It shares its kitchen with the Indian joint so you know it must be good by transient property. The menu is full of heart stopping amounts of meat and one veggie option, a lone veggie burger. I ordered it up and consumed it at once. It was pretty good. Seemed to have some Indian spices which was kind of cool. The cook time was good and the only thing that sucked was lack of ketchup at the counter. Everyone else that ordered here seemed to enjoy their burgerous occasion.
2	Misleading, and very low quality burgers......McDonalds Angus Style......it sucked. Nuff Said. Only if there is nothing left to eat....go here.Whoever wrote the other reviews has never set foot into a real Burger place that has the Fresh Ground beef.They have the kitchen to do it......buy a meat grinder and start grinding daily, charge more and make more.....and watch your sales GROW!
1	I wish I could do zero stars. HEY, BIG BURGER, YOU'RE A HAMBURGER STAND. IN A CASINO!!! 25 minutes for a burger doesn't cut it. And what the heck do you mean, you don't have enough burners???
