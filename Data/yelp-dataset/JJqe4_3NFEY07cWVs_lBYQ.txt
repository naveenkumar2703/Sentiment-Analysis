5	What a find! I have one pair of Stuart Weitzman shoes, and even with a sale and a coupon at Macy's I still spent way too much on them. The outlet offers some FABULOUS deals - most everything I saw was less than $200. During my visit, every sale shoe was an additional 35% off so I scored an awesome pair of heels for a mere $60. This store is a great addition to the Vegas outlets. It still has the feel of a high-end shoe store, with great service to boot.
5	I have been shopping here for years. This is one of those stores that you don't want to tell everyone about. I am finally coming out of the shoe closet. Every time I am in Vegas this is my First store stop. If you luck out and hit this outlet when they're having a sale you can walk away with unbelievable STEALS. Shoes & Handbags. Price range is cheap to moderate (scale based on retail) Also they also have Kate Spade outlet too. So keep the Secret.! Hints: If you are staying at a hotel in Las Vegas ask the hotel concierge if there's a shuttle going to the outlets near FREMONT Street. This is NOT the outlet mall near the airport.So keep the Secret.!
5	My girlfriend is a big fan of Stuart's; so it comes to no surprise, as we are rummaging through the Vegas premium outlets we HAD to come visit Stuart Weitzman. What did come as a surprise, however, is the exceptional sale they were having: buy one pair get the second for a measly 39 bucks!!!! To top off our highly satisfied indulgence, Anthony, the all too wonderful salesman went above and beyond--dusted and cleaned the pair of shoes I was wearing as  my girlfriend shopped!!! Are you kidding me right now?! This guy is fabulous!!!! Anthony, you make Stuart proud!
1	It's closed. It doesn't exist anymore. I went all the way there to find that out
