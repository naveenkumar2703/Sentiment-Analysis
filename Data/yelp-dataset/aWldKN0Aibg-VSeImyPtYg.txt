3	This is the closest location to my house, so when we made the big update to DVR w/ Cox, this is where we brought back our old boxes.  We could just not shake the feeling that there was just one guy there who really knew what he was doing.  Though it's not as bad as that sounds, because everyone else knew that they didn't know squat, so they would work on their own for 2 minutes, then call him over to ask a question.  I'd rather have someone who knows they know nothing than someone who thinks they know everything - any day.  We were in and out of their quick enough and everyone was pleasant enough.  Not a place you want to hang out all day - unless you really desperately want to watch free cable.
3	Three and a half stars because I'm feeling generous today. Actually it would be a solid two, if it weren't for a couple of things:Customer service is surprisingly good. Call them and before too long and without too much navigation you will get an actual human on the line, who will genuinely try to assist in your plight, whatever it may be. In many cases, they can't help you but are fairly good about putting you into touch with someone to come by your house. Unfortunately, that is where they lose it. The people that come by your house say they'll show up "between 2 and 7" (this is totally inexcusable to me, btw. It is the 21st century for christs' sake, you have an email address, a cell phone, and maybe even a blackberry. You can narrow it down to atleast a two hour block. This goes for the lot of them.)The other redeemer is that sometimes the mistakes Cox makes can actually benefit you, the customer. Case in point, my sister purchased a basic cable package for a few months before deciding she didn't watch it so she called them and had it turned off. Unless someone was just being nice, they took the cable box but the basic cable continues to work to this day on her TV, almost a year later.So don't ever say incompetence can't hook it up from time to time.
3	****UPDATE****Ok - Cox added lots more HD and On Demand, so I bumped them from 1 to 3 stars.  But I still think the internet service blows and they are pricey.********ORIGINAL REVIEW*******Cox does suck ass.  They way overcharge for everything - cable, phone, and internet.  I use there voicemail service and it only allows my phone to ring twice before it goes to vmail and I haven't figured out a way to change it.  How annoying when I'm running to pick up the phone. . .The internet speed is atrocious for what they charge.  I pay $45/mo for what is advertised as up to 9Mbps download rate.  On a CNET bandwitdth test right now (3:00 on a Saturday - http://reviews.cnet.com/7004-7254_7-0.html) I am getting 450Kbps rate.  Pathetic.  That's literally 1/20th of the advertised rate.They barely carry any cable stations.  I was surprised when I found MTV Hits but no MTV Jams, no VH1 soul.  They carry like 10 HD channels - no Food Network HD, no Animal Planet HD. . .but I do get A&E HD (which half the time doesn't show true HD programming)!  And no On Demand either - get with it Cox!  That's one of the reasons to get cable over satellite!  And you don't even offer it!  To top it all off, I ordered the Extra Innings baseball package which, as advertised, had "select games in HD".  When I called to order it while watching the free preview, I asked exactly which games those were.  "Huh?  Well it depends on the broadcast we receive. . ."  Oh really?  Because I'm watching a broadcast in standard def but it has a little HD logo in the corner.  "Oh, well, let me check. . .yeah we don't re-broadcast any of the games in HD."  So "select games in HD" actually means "no games in HD."  Truth in advertising. . .A microcosm of Cox cable - the '07 MLB playoffs were being broadcast by TBS, and I remarked to a friend (who has Direct TV) how bogus it was that a station that's not in HD is carrying playoff baseball.  He told me that in fact TBS does broadcast in HD.  Lo and behold, a week into the playoffs, Cox started carrying TBS HD!  I guess enough people called in and complained.  Of course, the day after the Dbacks were eliminated by the Rockies, they took TBS HD off the lineup.You might think it impossible to be happy with your cable provider.  Not true.  I had RCN in Boston and rate them 5 stars .SO SCREW YOU COX!  When I move out of my place in 6 months I'm getting Direct TV immediately.
3	They are complete cocks at this location and it's a pretty ghetto operation for such a large business. Given the choices of high speed internet, home phone and television - this is probably the best one if you want all of it from one company. The alternatives aren't better. If you want to get services from different companies though, you may do better than getting them all from Cox, but there's drawbacks from that as well.Customer service is bullshit and their prices are too high, but whatever. Good luck getting technical support. They are clueless. Even so, it's better than the alternatives. Sad but true.
1	Update to the update.  Who knew moving from Scottsdale to Central Phx would mean I would give up the (albeit craptastic) OnDemand service, which isn't offered for Phoenix residents!  Apparently they also charge Phoenix residents more money for what is obviously fewer services.And the kicker - my new apartment is pre-wired for ethernet with CAT-5 jacks in every room, but when Cox came to set me up again they insisted they couldn't wire my internet through the existing wiring.
1	i need someone to explain to me how cable companies get monopolies over cities when their customer services and services offered are total crap and over priced.  I left the east coast happy to get away from the monster that is INSIGHT and here it seems their counterpart is even worse.  Nothing gets completed when they say it will,  the channels freeze constantly,  the internet is barely faster than dial up, and god forbid if you try to get any issues resolved thru their automated service that is apparently programmed to only understand french, where you will then be transfered to 7 different people, then hung up on.They better hope a) another company doesnt move in or b) Hulu doesnt widen the show selection or they will be null n void.The apartments not letting you have dish ntwk is probably a whole other review section, huh.
1	So, let me first say that cox sucks cox literally. We have cable internet through them, that which d/cs and lags all the time. Its terrible. Upon calling them all they do is try to get you to by a new  modem, my bf has a network degree so we know its not the modem. The real reason i hate, hate, hate them  is due to the shit they refer to as cable service. The biggest problem we have is with the HD channels. They constantly flicker and crack, or go out completely. They also freeze nearly every day, it makes me so glad I'm paying out the ass for this. Also, the regular cable channels do the same thing occasionally, also the sound likes to go out randomly. So, if you'd love to pay high prices for crap service then cox is the cable company for you.
1	I've had Cox internet/cable service at my home in Tempe since 2008. So far I feel like we're subsidizing a predatory monopoly by allowing Cox to stay in business preventing fair competition in the market.For example:(a) Installation didn't work. They will only set up one jack for internet and will only use existing lines. So if you have cable jacks that are not hooked up to your current line, they are essentially useless. Cox won't activate a jack that is for example, in your living room, if it isn't already activated. (b) Service has interruptions and is not as fast as advertised. Because all the cable lines in Tempe are above ground, anytime a tree hits the power poles, you don't have internet for a few days.(c) Cable lines above ground also conduct lightning. When lightning hit near my neighbors house across the street nothing except my roommates computer was fried because I have every outlet on a surge protector. Where the ethernet cord was connected to my roommates computer, there was a visible burn and his laptop was destroyed.(d) Billing is not rational. If you decide to change the amount of service you subscribe to, they overbill you. You will spend several hours on the phone with customer service for your next three bills, because what they didn't overcharge you for the first months, they will overcharge you for in the following 3 months.(e) When there are billing problems they will turn off your account for a $14 difference even if it is not a month overdue  without giving you notice. Then they charge you a fee for the turn off. Then when you call to have it fixed, they tell you to call back when the billing department opens weekdays bankers hours.(f) Then they stop sending you a bill. I haven't received a bill for over 9 months. I just autopay from my checking account and have no idea what they are doing with my money. I've asked them to send it to me, but people on the phone never seem to be able to follow through.(g) To top it all off, I just received a threat of suit because Lions Gate alleges that I downloaded a movie, that I didn't download. Cox cable gave them my ID from my IP address so they could look at the transactions that occur from my IP address. When I responded that the download was false, I get an automatic reply telling me to encrypt my wireless and am directed to call their useless customer service line. -I never signed away my rights to privacy, and I don't download movies (have netflix, no need).(h) The local free TV stations can't be seen unless we buy the basic cable package. The threat of suit  based on my alleged internet use is the last straw. Cox is a predatory business that uses it's monopoly on pre-existing cable lines to assert it's authority over our access to information on the internet, and what should be free television stations.  Cox cable didn't provide the infrastructure they are using; they shouldn't be allowed to benefit from the tax breaks we gave the phone and electricity companies to set up the network of  lines Cox now uses. They shouldn't be given this benefit, because they overcharge for their services, have predatory billing practices and fail to respect our individual privacy in our homes.
1	They have a "billing department" who will not send me a bill!?They are refusing to send me a paper bill, because I pay in advance. So they will never send me a paper bill unless there is an amount due. They won't send any notice of my account standing, or even an invoice with my balance. I told them I need my bills for my tax purposes; I expense my internet bill for my home business...and they still won't send any bills, any invoices or any statements that show my payments, what they charge me each month or anything.I'm on my 3rd level of supervisors and they're just wasting my time. The worst part is that there is no other cable internet provider here. If I could switch, I'd do it in a heartbeat.WHY DO WE LET THESE COMPANIES HAVE A MONOPOLY ON THE MARKET?
2	The address posted  when you use cox communications as a search are not there at all!! the 1801 Apache, nope the 833 Broadway nope!!!wasted a lot of time because of this... they need to update their addresses on Google... I know the one on Broadway has been gone for over a year!!
1	Our daughter was recently in a hospice care home and is under the careof hospice.  We made the mistake of bundling close to a year ago. Theydid not have their line buried or even in conduit so our line was cut leaving us with no phone, cable or internet. Called and reported before 8:30 a.m. Recalled again at 4:10 as no one had come to repair. Was advised it might not be until the next day. I explained our daughter's situation and Drs and nurses may need to reach us and it was a medical emergency. I was advised it was not a medical emergency because our daughter was currently not in our home! Our daughter is dying and that's apparently no medical emergency to Cox.  Also, bills are going up each month even though we are in a contract. Two things:  Don't bundle as you lose everything when a line is cut-and STAY AWAY FROM COX!
2	This service sucks....Cox.  At a "discounted" rate for Internet, cable and phone I was paying $108.87 a month.  I receive a bill for the month of April:  $117.00.  In May, SURPRISE, it was $144.87.  LOVELY.  There is nothing I can do, unless I want to downgrade my Internet or remove my home phone; the latter option is not feasible because my burglar alarm works through the phone modem.  Knowing this, please don't burgle me.Cable service isn't that great.  The TV menu sucks, and there are literally zero free "on-demand" programs.  I thought "on demand" implied "at no cost."  I guess not.  Swindlers.  I miss Comcast in Denver :-(
2	I was promised a promotion price12 months for $24.99 for their basic internet.Two months later, they raise $5 to $29.99.I asked them to explain.They said, they only promised $10 off from $34.99 for 12 months, not $24.99 for 12 months.This $10 off promotion is not honest, because they can raise the amount as often as they want.I've encountered this kind of business practice twice from Cox.Do record whatever they promise you from this company.
3	Want to cancel all or part of your services and not wait in line forever or have to deal with their negotiating to keep you as a customer?Well, let me tell you my little secret*:1.  Dress scandalously - as in your boobs have never been more on display.2.  Ask one of the staff members if you can sit at the counter while you wait. 3. Continue to smile and make eye contact while he says yes. 4. When he ignores the line and asks what you're in for, just tell him that you're dropping off equipment and all you need is a receipt. 5.  Marvel at how you just canceled a service in 4 minutes AND you didn't have to endure the "customer retention specialists" (read: assholes) for an insane period of time. You're welcome!*This may or may not work for the gentlemen out there.
1	terrible! every time I have to deal with these fools it is a nightmare! Something must be done about monopolies like this. Consumers need real choices!Cox sucks it.
1	I wish I could give Cox 0 stars. Horrendous, hair-pulling experience.
1	I have Cox cable, it's passable. This review is for their marketing, which gets placed on my door daily.Listen, dipshits. The sign on my house says "NO SOLICITING" which means it is illegal to post bills, ads, flyers, your bullshit marketing, etc. It's such an epic waste of paper, time, and money. STOP. NO ONE sits around and wonders where to get internet service and then one day they go to their door and there is your door hanger and rejoices that now they can get internet.
1	If you have a childish love for hating humanity and enjoy activities like jerking a rusty butter knife across your throat cox is the ISP for you.Not only does their "24/7" only work from 9-5 m-f they barely could care less if they solve the problem. I had to go to the better business bureau to finally  solve a hanging laggy internet problem. Even the BBB couldn't get a response for about 3 months. When it did go through I got finally a glimmer of hope in a great technician named John as he solved most of my internet problems regarding bad cables. John solved my problems temporarily but it's clear that this stellar Lieutenant on the front line cannot solve the inadequacies and leaks that stem from poor system design and just a lackluster UX. (if they even care about the end user at all)However no technician no matter his professionalism and great candor can stop Cox's sh**** customer service, or the fact that our internet goes to sh** when high traffic hours come on.Cox is passable when you don't have issues. When one starts however, you can clearly see the cracks in their structure. My identity was stolen and a payment on my internet bill bounced due to Wells Fargo closing my account down to prevent further theft. I explained this to their CSR reps and still I have oodles of strange and weird charges on my bill. I mean why is their 2 charges for credit card and e-check denials on top of credit adjustment above it? Isn't that a little redundant to fix a charge and then charge me back for the charge I was credited back? There's a mountain of () and #'s that would make a license CPA want to scream.Even better is their automated voice system when you call in that makes you go through loopholes only to make sure to remind you at the end of their maze that they are closed. 24 hours customer service my brownie butt.  Shouldn't 1 call fix this relatively small problem instead of having to call back and check if "Cox" is ready for you? Oh yea I bought a new modem and router thanks to their whizes at their in store locations which is like putting a band-aid on a gaping wound. You can improve your end but the likelihood that Cox holds up theirs is doubtful and will remain so until the USA changes legislation that makes ISP standard what the Asians in Korea, Japan, hell even China have today.I want to talk to the system engineers and upper management of cox? What is the business vision of cox? To spread the corporate love of a company that survives by a cartel business structure and not one of true democracy? The CEO of Cox should really contemplate where his ship is going and look deep down if he wants to be the caretaker of a customer service/business model that most Cash-Advance Loan Sharks wouldn't touchIt's digusting that the only other option in my neighborhood is cox or shaky looking century link dsl connection.    So yeah if you have 99 problems and your downright darius about becoming a centurion go ahead and sign Cox up as your ISP provider.
4	clean place and friendly people!
1	Used to be a great company.  Now they just flat out suck
5	I had great service at the Tempe Marketplace Cox retail store today. I had to drop off my dvr and change my phone service so I drove down to the Cox store. As I entered there was a service representative there to greet me. He took the dvr, walked over to the counter and made the changes in immediately. I think that I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. The representative was both courteous and efficient.
1	DO NOT USE COX.  - False charges and terrible customer service!!(and I usually only write positive reviews, see my other reviews)I placed an order online for TV and Internet, and then went into the store to pick up the equipment, the salesman said there was no record of the sale or charges. I checked my account he was correct that there was not a charge, so he "took care" of me.  (this is where I should have just walked out)I was going to get the TV and Internet bundle, he informed me that there would be an installation fee and I would have to buy a router, or, I could upgrade to the, "triple play bundle" which would include a phone, but would also include the router and would waive installation fees. I agreed as the savings upfront was important than the extra $10/month.  He then proceeded to give me the router and other equipment, and set up an appointment for the tech to come out and install.  Tech came out, all was well.  Except, 3 months later when the router (which constantly lost connection) finally died. I called Cox to set up an appointment and they notified me that there would be a charge for the service since I had decided to use our own router.  But wait, I did not use our own router, I used the one they gave me. As it turns out the salesman never made a note or any record at all indicating that he gave me a router. I spent HOURS on the phone explaining this to them and finally, after calling several different numbers reached someone that "agreed" and told me there would NOT be a charge and that I was using their router.  I set up an appointment and the tech came out, he investigated and found that the router was faulty and the issue was not my fault, and replaced the router. I verified again with him, that this was their router, not mine, and that there would not be a charge since it was not my fault. He agreed with this, and went on his way.  A few days later I received a bill in the mail charging me $49.95 + tax and fees for a service charge. I e-mailed Cox and was told that since I used my own router I had to pay a fee. I explained to them again that this was not my router, the salesman gave it to me, they told me again, since it was my router and there was no indication it was given to me that I would be paying for it.  The only conclusion that I can come to is that the salesman needed to sell the Triple Play Bundle so gave me a router (known to be faulty? returned by someone who was renting it?) and never made a note about this, as he was probably not supposed to it in the first place. Now I am stuck in this situation and have spent HOURS with them trying to get it changed so it shows the router was given to me, and to get the fee waived.  No one has been helpful, their customer service has been terrible. I have called several numbers, e-mail and did the online chat.  They are scam artists, and have HORRIBLE service. DO NOT USE COX!!! Try out Prism or wait for Amazon's service.
5	Bobby is awesome. Professional, and really tries his best to give the customer what they want for a great price.
4	Most of these reviews are just complaining about Cox's service, which I will agree...it is way overpriced for what they offer. What I'm reviewing is the efficiency of their employees and an actual visit to this brick & mortar store. I came in to return my borrowed router and forgot my bill...I also didn't make an appointment.  No problem, the employee was able to look up my account and finished the whole process within a minute. So, feel free to return your equipment here!
1	Review for 6 months in internet service, not this location.  I had centurylink DSL for years, decided to switch to cox for faster service. I got my modem and hooked everything up (used to have cox cable years ago). Got fast speeds and seemed to work well for about a week. I kept having the internet cut out off and on for multiple times a day and random times. Called cust service and they were able to see that this was happening and sent out a tech in 48 hours. Tech redid all the lines and appeared to work. About 3-4 days later, off/on again service, like before. This time they said to replace the modem. I did and I then again keep having the problem. I ended up just using my verizon hotspot more the time for my wifi need and cancelled my service. Back on centurylink for 3 weeks now, and never had a wifi problem since. Not sue who to blame, but they wold not fix the problem.
1	Worst cable company on earth. Not only are the rates ridiculous they made me drive in to get a cable box to replace the faulty box I had.. But the "new" box they gave me also didn't work. Their service is a joke. We need more options for cable providers.
4	Walked in and saw about 40 people ahead of me. To my surprise the handful of workers got through the crowd quickly and I didn't have to wait nearly as long as I thought I would. Biggest disappointment was the lady that helped me had no idea about an online promotion and couldn't give me the price I saw online. I even showed her the website on my phone. What I got instead of the promotional price was a phone number followed by a 45 min wait while listening to the same 30 secs of the most annoying song in phone history when I got home. Bait and switch? I doubt it, and I don't blame the store staff. The store experience, what I checked into, was exceptionally more pleasant than I expect. If I could check into and leave a review for the phone experience I would leave zero stars and use every angry face emoji in the catalog. Way to go store employees, kudos.
5	I went in today wanting to upgrade my cable and internet. I'm not a fan of doing those things online because I had questions. The lady greeted me with a smile and quickly took me back to the desk to set everything up. Within 10 minutes I was out the door with everything I needed to set cable up in two rooms. Painless, efficient, would highly recommend!
4	Although I was annoyed we had to come in the store bc customer service on the phone was so bad.... However Austin was super helpful, friendly, and understanding! Thank you Austin for being the only cox support member who was able to help!
1	Worst customer service ever.  Charged me twice for connecting the Internet.  Charged me for a cable TV self-installation kit I never received.  Customer service is indifferent as to how to resolve issues.  TV reception is terrible.  Internet is passable.  DirecTV is a much better option and cost less.  I will never opt for Cox again.  There is nothing good about Cox anymore.
