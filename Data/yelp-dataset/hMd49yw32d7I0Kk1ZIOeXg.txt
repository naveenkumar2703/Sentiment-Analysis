4	Slightly above average location taking into consideration the age of the building these guys are in and the "neighborhood".
5	Very good service and food. Very clean inside. Was greeted with a smile. Food came out hot and in a timely fashion.
2	I eat at Arby's including this location a number of times a week. I get there beef and cheddar I have always got them 2 for $5.00 when i was rang me up it was almost $9.00 I asked  the casher if they were not on sell anymore she was looking it up when Joe the manger came up and said very rudely if you don't have a coupon then you pay full price. I told him I have never needed one before he said well you should have and will for now on, so if you want them you will pay full price for them! He was just very rude about it. I am unsure if I will come back to this store again.
4	The lady was cleaning tables when I walked in and said hello to me. She was very sweet and kind, even walked the food to me while I was sitting.
3	Nice people. Food is good as well. No rudeness. They brought our food out to us.
