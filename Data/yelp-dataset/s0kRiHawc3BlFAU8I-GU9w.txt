4	I frequent this particular Subway quite often because I like their sandwiches and I can "make it a meal" for $5 total!Just recently, I was picking up lunch and the cashier warned me that their ice machine was acting up.  I gambled and ordered the fountain soda anyway because I just HAVE to have ice with my soda!  Well, the ice machine acted up and I did not get any ice.  I was very bummed out.  This particular shift leader saw what happened and said to me, "Wait right there a second" (I was still at the soda machine).  He went to the establishment next door and came back with a cup of ice.  Considering the day I was having and I so wanted a very cold Diet Coke with ice, what he did that day was the equivalent of winning the lottery!  I've joked around with this shift leader before.  Maybe he did it because I'm such a regular and we have been friendly towards each other.  Regardless, he went above and beyond for this customer and I truly appreciated it!
2	10pm on a Friday night.  Wanted a hassle free french dip sandwich.  Tried Subway substitute steak sandwich.  Horrible.  How can they call it meat let alone steak?
4	Clean and friendly staff. Great for a quick lunch.
3	I was out with a customer and we only had about 40 minutes to eat lunch so he suggested Subway.  They were a little backed up as the rest of the lunch crew wasn't due in yet but it didn't take too long.  I had a 12" chicken bacon melt and it tasted pretty good.They didn't mind us moving tables around fro a group of 5.  The place was clean.  As we got closer to noon the line really grew.
