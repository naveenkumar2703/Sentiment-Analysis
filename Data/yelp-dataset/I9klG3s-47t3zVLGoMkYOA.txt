4	This Mexican fast food restaurant looks run down but the food is good. I like their daily specials Monday thru Friday. 99 cent Taco's on Tuesday and 99 cent Bean burrito's on Wednesday. 60 cents to add cheese. There is one friendly old Mexican guy that works around midnight to 6AM. He makes the best Bacon, egg and cheese burrito i ever eaten. He always greets me by saying in a thick accent" How are you doing my friend". Wish i stilled lived near this restaurant. i used to always eat there.
4	Drive thru took a little longer than I would of expected, but can't complain about the food X)nom nom nom
4	Grungy little drive thru, but I have to make this a stop every time I am in Phoenix. Their breakfast burritos with hot sauce - it's what I crave.
5	I love this filiberto's they have an amazing $1 menu for weekdays! $1 quesadillas fridays are the best and their green chili is amazing. It is however in the ghetto and there is no in door seating. Hands down best filiberto's ever for their $1 menu!!
2	The food is good but the wait is always way too long. Anytime of day they are slow. There's no reason to go to Filibertos cause there are other places nearby.
2	I hate to give any place a low rating but getting ripped off is NOT ok so I suppose if they even care, they're lucky getting 2 instead of 1 ~ even though we WON'T b back!! Filibertos used 2 b the place that any other fill~in~the~blank: berto's tried 2 imit8. Gone r the days of nice ample portions 4 decent prices & quite frankly I haven't really considered them Filiberto's 4 awhile now... more like fill~their~pockets while giving u the shaft.    Burritos u can expect 2 b mostly tortilla/hardly any filling & if they were @ least longer & skimpy or stumpy but fat it might b ok, but here we go again w/ another drive~ thru mexican place that's cutting corners & charging more 4 less in quality, ingredients, quantity & don't even get me started on the so~called service aspect. (more complete lack~there~of).    Order & get charged 4 a Large Pina & discover it's water results in them looking @ u crazy like ur trying 2 get something 4 free when u tell them. Uhm, no just would like 2 get something close 2 what I ordered & paid 4. And speaking of water... red & green sauce cups r 1/2 filled & mostly water w/ color & little flavoring & they just love throwing them in ur bag on top of whatever u order so it gets all over the place & satur8es napkins (if they even include them) cuz they don't secure the cheap lids, even when u ask 4 them in a seper8 bag. Yeah, they understood me (I've asked both in English & in Spanish). Yes a 'gringa' can talk Spanish fluently... ;-p   And I really don't get why a "drive~thru" can take SOooo Long when u discover there's nowhere near the food in ur bag that Filiberto's used 2 b famous 4. As I've said b4, if any place inevitably increases their prices as often will b the case, @ least let it b equivalent 2 what it was b4. Also when a Veg~head orders the very limited items we have 2 choose from & almost every time finds some meat that somehow managed 2 b in their pl8 or burrito, that's a Huge EWWW!!  So will we ever c Fili(F*ck)tards again? Best Amy Winehouse voice echoes No, no, NO!!!
1	Takes way too long to receive your food and when I got my tacos the shells were soggy. Will not be returning to this filibertos.
