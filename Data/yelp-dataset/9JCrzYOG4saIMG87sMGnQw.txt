5	AMAZING Emporium is more like it! I had been dreaming of a perfect vintage place that would make my trip to Madison just right, and this was the place!Its just a few steps off the main drag of State Street, so it might be easy to miss, but its oh so worth the extra steps. Inside you will find the kind of piled high with just about everything vintage store I LOVE. The woman behind the counter did not smile the whole time and in fact kinda looked at me like I might be sealing, but she added to the character of the place. Prices are all over the place from $5 for some pretty cool vintage U of Madison stuff to $89 for an AMAZING vintage Bob Dylan shirt I found in perfect vintage-worn condition. They have an especially good selection of hats and strange wigs, so I imagine it would be a great stop for Halloween costumes of themed college parties. You could dec out a whole group with the multitudes of marching band hats, army helmets and Raggedy-anne wigs. After about 45 minutes or so, and casing the entire store I droped about $150 on a plethora of amazingness and walked out like a child who just left the candy store. BUT IT GETS BETTER! We got to the corner only to be taped on the shoulder by a man who I assume was the old woman's son. We had been checking out some vintage marching band hats and opted not to buy them, but apparently they liked us -- and he handed me and my two friends each a hat. OF COURSE we promptly put them on and proceeded to wear them all afternoon :)Adventure worthy, yes indeed!
