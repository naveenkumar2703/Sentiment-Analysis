1	I have used this company about 3 times and every time they have been late! I don't know why but I felt I should give them another chance each time. Yesterday the owner Skyland over slept for my appointment and rescheduled for today and has been a no show so far. In this economy I don't know how someone trying to start and run their own business can afford to treat customers, repeat cutstomers this way.When they do come they do a good job, but the lack of professionalism and tardiness is unacceptable. They have never offered any compensation or adjustments for being late. A small apology and a terrible excuse is all I got.Go with a reputable company and skip this terrible and unprofessional company!
5	I was referred to this company from a friend   When I looked up the reviews I was a little concerned. They showed up right when they said they would and did an excellent job. My old carpets look almost new again. They answered my calls and are very professional. I definitely recommend them for carpet cleaning services.
5	I cant believe how clean they got my carpet, they look like new! I prefer factory fresh because they have a RX-20  aka " miracle worker". they guy was even nice enough to do a tile cleaning sample in my kitchen. professional and affordable!
5	I have been using Carpet Fresh for several years. They have always done a fabulous job. If you want a quality company with great customer service use Carpet Fresh.
