5	The Commons is a coffee shop and christian bookstore located on the edge of Gilbert and Chandler.  The building is a AWESOMELY designed place with tons of glass (including an entire wall of roll up glass "garage doors") that allows the outside and the inside to intermingle.  The roofline alone is reason to check it out as it has a very cool gull wing style and it looks amazing.  The coffee is from Starbucks brewed and they do a great job with all of the different drinks that one would expect at a upscale coffee shop.  The space is open, airy, and modern.  They could seat about 100 people inside by the look of it.  Free Wi-fi and a bank of iMacs for customer use are also available.  Although it is a on a church campus, the building itself is completely stand alone and is run independently.  (Although it is a great church on it's own).
5	The common have a splendid soy chi tea iced in the summer, and a warm one in the winter! A must try!
5	The Commons makes amazing coffees, teas, and fruit smoothies that are not full of HFCS! The staff is personable and the prices are just right. They also have sandwiches and cookies. Great atmosphere to just hang out between services and fellowship with friends!
