5	Amazing customer service and genuine interest in how they can help me. I couldn't believe how nice the banker helping me was.
1	Today certainly validated my decision to close all my accounts with Wells Fargo.  Elisabeth was of no help when i simply wanted to make an update to the auto draft I had on my IRA.  First she told me she couldn't do it then after I told her I had updated it with a form in a branch before she called in for help and they would send her the form.  After waiting for 10 minutes and still nothing I left.  Additionally what happened to a professional dress for a banker.  Jeans, tennis shoes and a football jersey is not it.
1	The worst branch! There is always a line, and you always have to wait to speak to a business banker. They are so understaffed here. The branch manager always asks me how am I doing and what he can do to better my experience but the experience is never different! Get a clue! The only person who knows what they are doing is val.
