5	The best! Dr. Walker is by far the most gentle dentist I have visited.  Not only is she great with adult patients, but she was so great with my 4 year old daughter. She makes visiting the dentist a very good experience.
5	I was referred to Stephanie Walker through a friend. I cannot say enough about this dentist. The whole staff is very kind, compassionate and professional at the same time. I felt comfortable with them the moment I walked into the front door. It is decorated beautifully in the office.. even the bathroom. Very clean and organized with up-to-date technology. Dr Walker has such a caring touch and is very good at what she does. I have always been one to HATE going to the dentist, but have now referred her many of my family and friends. Quite a few of my reluctant family members have already been to see her and used her services.I highly recommend Dr Walker and her staff to one and all!
1	I love Dr. Walker, she is awesome and she as a nice staff, but what i just cant deal with is their $50 appointment change fee. 48 hours is a lot of advanced notice for people who ALSO have important careers and schedule changes. I know her time is important but to charge an existing customer you are allready making a mint off of for me and three family members all with dental insurance... thats just not right.
