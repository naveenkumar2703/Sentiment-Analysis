1	I purchased a 18 X 36 print recently that I planned on framing. I stopped in Aaron Brothers even though I was planning on going to Michael's.  The lady there was very friendly and knowledgeable. She helped to choose a mat and frame. After everything was decided, she ran it through the computer and said the job would cost $675.00. I thought I must have heard wrong. She said it was correct and that it would normally be $975 but she was applying a 30% discount. I asked if we could look at an off the shelf frame. We picked one. The price of the frame was $32.50 and with a mat and labor it came to $185. Still more than I expected, but I decided to do it. She informed me that it could be ready July 30th, exactly one month. I laughed as I was leaving the store. How the hell do they stay in business? I did notice that there were two employees present and one customer, me. No surprises there.
5	We always get great customer service there. They are helpful and go beyond my expectations to make sure that we get the frames that we need.
