3	I really enjoy shopping at the pawn shops in Vegas.  There's always a good selection of products.  This location has a nice selection of jewelry and watches.  On a recent visit, I found a ring for The Better Half.  I bought it at a great price and squirreled it away for a future gift.  The Superpawn stores in Vegas are willing to deal with you.  I offered 30% less than their asking price (not sticker price) and got it....I probably should've asked for more, but once they agree it's hard to go less than that.Return Factor - 80%
1	Wow. Called to check on pawn for a friend. Put on hold twice for a ridiculous amount of time, almost comical til they hung up on me and I had to call back. No apology...nothing. Just put on hold...yet again. Infuriating. Totally rude & not helpful AT ALL. Thanks for the help sweet girls at Super Pawn.
