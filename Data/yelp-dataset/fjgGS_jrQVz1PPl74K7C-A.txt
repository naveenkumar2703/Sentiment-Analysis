4	This is the location where I see Dr. Constantia Abarikwu, MD. There are two sides to this facility the Internal Medicine side where I visit and the Saguaro Family Practice Clinic. I like this office and I enjoy Dr. Abarikwu and usually there is no problem getting in to see her and the wait time is not painful. Parking here is also a breeze, I like the fact that there is a lab on the premises.
1	Dr Rebbelke is the worst doctor ever. Very rude and suggests hippy alternatives. No one goes to doctors for hippy alternatives. Front staff also pushed multiple people in front of me extending my wait to an hour past my appointment time. Why bother having appointments if your walk ins get priority.
