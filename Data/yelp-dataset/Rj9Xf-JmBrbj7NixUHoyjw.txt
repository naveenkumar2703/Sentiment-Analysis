5	I called RBA after doing a certain amount of research online.They had excellent reviews and are a member of Angies List.I made an appointment for a consultation and Cherie their salesperson got there. She was here punctually and talked about the technology of replacement windows thoroughly. At the outset I indicated to  her I was interested in changing only six windows but would like changing all 12 windows eventually.Cherie was very competent and helpful and not pushy at all. I made up my mind to go ahead and replace all 12 windows.The day of the installation I had a crew of 4 people show up and on time and they completed the installation by 4pm and cleaned everything up and vacuumed by 6pm. I will definitely recommend Renewal by Andersen Windows. They have made shopping for windows a wonderful and pain free experience.Thank you  again,
1	Pushy annoying sales people. Overpirced Prices more than doubled in last year. Unprofessional employees rude, arrogant and disrespectful attitude. I would not buy from them if they were the only choice! HIgh turn over of staff says a lot about the company. Too many choices out there to waste your time with this racket.
1	Called to have a "free" home estimate.  After spending about 10 minutes getting an appointment scheduled, they asked me who else lives in my home.  I told them it was not their business to know whom lived in my home.  I am the decision maker and only decision maker.  They transferred me to a "boss" and then they asked a few questions and said, they needed to know if I were married or anyone else owned my home.  I explained that I was the only decision maker and none of their business who lived in my home.  Finally I had to hang up on them.  I believe they are looking to intimidate and hard sell someone, especially a female.  There is no way I would tell them if I were married or had someone living with me or not.  I can make my own decision on new windows on my home.
