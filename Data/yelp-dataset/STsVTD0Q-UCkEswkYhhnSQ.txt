3	This is one of your order at the cashier, collect a number and wait for your food at the table restaurants. The food is alright. Nothing great. Service is fast and friendly. The menu is salads, pasta and pizza. Food is priced fairly inexpensively somewhere between fast food and your garden variety sit down dining establishments. This is a good place to come if you want quick service on a weekend and don't wish to wait in live forever .
1	*GAG* Worst Italian food I've ever had!  Worse than Olive Garden!  Food was bland and over cooked.  Sad part is that Olive Garden was in the same parking lot.
4	The other reviews were kinda lame. Bravi is great and extremely underrated. I have had almost everything on the menu and would get it all again. It is fast and tastes great. The Tuscan tomato soup is seriously one of the best soups I have ever had. My favorites are the Portobello ravioli and the Chicken parmesan. Everyone needs to try this place. Its worth the it, the food is great and its fairly inexpensive.
