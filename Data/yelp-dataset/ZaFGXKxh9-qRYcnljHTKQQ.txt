5	If you are looking for a dance studio or just simply a place to bring you children to gain self confidence and enhance creative arts... Look no further... I have lived in Las Vegas only for a short time and I frequently visit there.  My sister's daughter has been dancing with Heather for quite some time.  Heather has helped to mold an exquisite dancer and she has built an award winning 8 year old into a confident passionate creation of the arts.As I watch my niece do some unreal movements I see that Heather makes class fun and lively for all including the parents.Heather, not knowing her on a personal level I can see she takes great pride in the work she does and is very confident in teaching her craft.There are many dance studio's in the Las Vegas area, but when it comes to your children, and a family oriented studio where parents are welcomed to be hands on, and fitness, and dance with your own creative arts flair with a well-known dance teacher that seeks out crafty performers... And seeks out bigger opportunities for them... and takes the extra mile for you and your family... Look no further... We love Heather's dance life... And we love Heather also...
