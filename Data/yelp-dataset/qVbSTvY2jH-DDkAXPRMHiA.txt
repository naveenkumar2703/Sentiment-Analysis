5	I loved the vegetarian selection, and the prices were quite reasonable for Vegas dining!I liked it so much I dragged my friends in for a second meal here. I had:-potato & onion omelette/tortilla espanola-marinated manchego cheese/queso manchego al romero-spicy potatoes with tomato alioli/patatas bravas-goat cheese baked in tomato sauce/queso de cabra al horno-mushroom empanada, porcini alioli/empanada de setas-roasted red pepper spanish pizza-black raspberry sangriaThe porcini alioli was heavenly! My two favorite dishes were the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, and the mushroom empanada. The Spanish pizzas are a surprisingly good deal (lots of food for not too much). I looooooooved the sangria.
