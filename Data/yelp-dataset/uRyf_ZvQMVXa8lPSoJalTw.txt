3	This month I am changing up the diet a bit and not eating meat.  I recently got a call from this newly opened place offering some BOGO discounts.  Just one me, I don't tend to buy 2 of anything cooked.  However I had to drive by one day this week on my way back to the shop and decided to see what their veggie pizza was like.  It was pretty good, plenty of toppings.  Their pizzas are thin crust, which I prefer.  This is a turn key franchise.  Everything inside is bright and shiny new.  You can see the pizza oven and it is open on both ends and the pizza travels on a conveyor.  The folks waiting on me were pleasant.  My pizza was ready in about 12 minutes.
4	There are several tiers of pizza in this town. You've got your gourmet, "Neapolitan" pizza to get snobby over. You've got your really good pizza parlors to sit down and gain a couple of pounds. And then you've got your cheap, greasy pizza to feed broke college study groups, cure hangovers, or just be a plain fatty. Fox's Pizza belongs to that third group, and does it well. I like how this place is super-clean, and how they start rolling out the dough for my order right away. Tasty. Fresh. Cheap. How can I not like it?
1	Here's the Fox business model:1-Cease distribution of coupons for several months2-Post flyer inside offering something closer to a reasonable price than a special deal3-Deny customers the price on the window, saying "Oh, that's only if you have a coupon"So I can confirm it's definitely not worth the prices they normally charge. Specialties cost as much as what you can get at a place like Barro's or Old Chicago...but not half as good. All that aside, I'll go to a place that actually charges the prices they advertise.
5	Awesome pizza and staff I'd always find to be very friendly!!! They definitely don't go cheap on the cheese! Too bad they had to close down so quickly.
