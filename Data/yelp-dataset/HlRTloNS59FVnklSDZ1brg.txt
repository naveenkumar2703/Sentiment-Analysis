5	This store is great.  The store is always clean and the staff always friendly.  They have a good selection of items and I can always find what I need.   Usually, they have a good sale in the meat department and milk is usually reasonable.  I've been going to this store regularly for four years and there is very little turnover in their staff and we recognize each other.
4	I like the idea of a local grocer, but the prices are somewhat higher than the chain stores. I ventured into this location because the distributor for a rare item said this Bashas' carried it. No such luck. I was in the store long enough to appreciate how clean it is and some novelty items such as banana iced cookies, what!? I may have to pick some of those up.
5	Pizza pizza pizza. Tim in the deli is our pizza guy. He takes pride in his work. Is always friendly and the pizza is handmade goodness.  If you live way out east. Call in and go pick it up. Great stuff!
