3	My only experience with Canongate Kirk was a visit with an Edinburgh Ghost tour, well after midnight many months ago.Kirk's the word for a Scottish Church, and Canongate serves the Parish that includes the Scottish Parliament! Unfortunately I can't give a detailled recollection of how beautiful the church was etc etc because the only part of it I'm familiar with is it's graveyard! Morbid I know, but if you've ever been on one of these Ghost tours, that's exactly what you're in for.There are several prominent figures buried here, many important Scots men and women. I keep reading and hearing that Adam Smith is by far the most important person buried there, but to be honest I was much more amused by the tales of the gruesome and mysterious ends the other grave "inhabitants" had met.  I've uploaded an extremely helpful photo of a gravestones. Charming I know.
