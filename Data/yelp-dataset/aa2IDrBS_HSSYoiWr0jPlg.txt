5	A friend refered them to me after she used them to have a pond installed. They were honest, dependable and had fair pricing. They did a fantatic job cleaning up our  yard, planting shrubs and putting in a patio. I just signed up for monthly services.
1	This is not even a real business!!! Stay away. Do not use these people for their services.
1	We hired this company to build a patio and acid stain it.  It took months because we discovered this business was a part time hobby of the owner whom had another full time job; ergo he could only come out at night and do what little work he could before it got dark making a relatively simple project span months.  Nothing ever got done unless we called them to come out and continue the job and even then they would often times not even come out when they agreed to.  I can't imagine my expectations are so high-- maybe that's normal in this business?  We then discovered they sprayed stain all over the side of our home and then refused to clean it while blocking our requests on Facebook and ignoring weeks of phone calls and emails.   This leaves us to buy paint and fix it ourselves.Guys just stay clear of this business. It's just not worth it.
