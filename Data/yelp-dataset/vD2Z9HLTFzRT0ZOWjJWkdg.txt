5	Jacqueline was the perfect Realtor for me.She was always available whenever I needed her.She was efficient, knowledgeable and made sure I was always informed by sending me listings and following through on every appointment.Most of all I enjoyed the fact that she was not overbearing or pushy.Thats something I do really appreciate when looking for a place to live.It sometimes takes time and she is very understanding of that. I always refer friends and family to her when they are in the market for a home.
5	What a WONDERFUL woman to work with!!! Jacqueline helped my family purchase our second home in Arizona! She was very patient and actually listened to my husband and I to make sure that she found us the perfect home that would fit our high expectations. She was always on time for appointments and responded to my emails in a timely manner which I loved!!!If you are looking for a realtor/broker in the Scottsdale & Phoenix area, look no further...Jacqueline is a true professional. She will definitely impress you & assist you in finding your next  home!
