4	What can you say about dry cleaners that hasn't already been said?hahaIt's just that these guys are great at what they do. They charge a fair price in a category that's over priced, for a service that is excellent. They are very accommodating when you loose your receipt, they'll search all over the place for your items if you swear they're not in your closet but you don't remember if you brought them to the dry cleaners or not, and they bend over backwards to get you that item rushed even if it's not on the schedule.They've been around for ever and there's a reason for that. They're just good at what they do and it deserves a review.
5	Great service and just nice folks. So glad I found them!
4	Excellent customer service. Was even able to get next day service. Preferred method of payment is cash/debit as they charge a credit card fee. However, they aim to keep their prices low so I am okay with that.They also do alterations and all kinds of other good stuff!
5	Suddenly without any notice, they are Closed.  Went there on Wednesday march19th and 3 days later, on Saturday, Park Discount Cleaners  is emptied out with a hand written note on the door; Closed  pick up your cleaning  across the street at a Competitor's company !!    This was the best cleaners, the only place I would go.  All cleaning done on the premises. So if anyone knows what happened  or why Charlie, the owner,  went out of business... please notify everyone.
