4	everyone knows how hectic bank depots can be. i come in here to handle merchant transactions for work. the customer traffic is hit or miss. the staff that work here have been 99% accurate. at two separate times, the teller shorted me a dime roll, and another time gave me an extra dime roll. no biggy. they actually called to say they shorted me. they definately greet upon walk-in so vibrantly.
3	On a happy day for me at work, I went to the bank. Slow day t the bank, but I was the only one waiting in the merchant line, for 20 mins while tellers kept taking customers at regular line(at least 5 customers).  It's cool that I still get paid to wait, but can't afford to be here all day. After the 6th person I decided to just hop in the regular line. They're really friendly but still not aware of their surroundings when someone's waiting at the merch line.The teller was done giving me my change order, so I asked for a handful of penny & quarter rolls. They give however much is needed. She gave me an inadequate amount so I asked for more and apologized, she turned around with this silent almost condescending body expression that made me feel akward for having to ask for more and just walked off with no greeting.
3	The branch itself is very polite.   A little slow, but ever-attentive when your turn is up.  It's the corporate office that ruins Wells Fargo with the endless fees.  They were, as mentioned, happy to help me move my account over to America First Credit Union.  I'll miss their every-ten-feet locations, but I like supporting my community.
