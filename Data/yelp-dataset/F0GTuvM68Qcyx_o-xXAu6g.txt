5	Maybe it was just lucky timing, but I walked into Cigna Urgent care at 755 E McDowell and within FIVE minutes was brought back by a nurse for some screening.  Within ten minutes, i was seen by Dr. Michael Esmay.  Everyone had great customer service and generally positive attitudes.  I was very impressed and everyone was polite with great bedside manner.
2	If you are looking for a health provider that comes with endless waits, resentful front desk personnel, and a musty smell of cigarette breath, this is the one for you! On the other hand, they do have a pharmacy conveniently located in the building and it is one stop shop for general medical, vision, and other services. But you'll need a healthy sense of self-esteem, a strong ability to deal with embittered people, and about 90 minutes of something to do while you wait for the appointment they so aggressively compelled you to show up for 20 minutes early.
