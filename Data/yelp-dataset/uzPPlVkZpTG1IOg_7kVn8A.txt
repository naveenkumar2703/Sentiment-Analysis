4	I attend performances by the Rainbow Company Youth Theatre.  The Center has two theatres, the intimate 80 seat Studio Theatre on the north side of the building, and a 275 seat main theatre on the west side of the building beyond the office of the Neon Museum.Last night., I saw the Rainbow Company's "The Zombies Walk Among Us" mostly performed by kids doing a fine job of acting and having fun.  Ity was the first time I've been in the Main Theatre, and it's quite a good performance space.  The rest of the shows for the Rainbow Theatre performed this year at Reed Whipple will be in the Studio Theatre.The art work and historic photos of Las Vegas makes the Reed Whipple a great place.
