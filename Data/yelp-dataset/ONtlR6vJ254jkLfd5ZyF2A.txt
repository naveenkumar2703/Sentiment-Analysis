5	I absolutely loved "Hello Tai Chi, Goodbye Stress."  What an awesome, relaxing  DVD! I am new to Tai Chi and Qi Gong and this DVD was very easy for me to follow. My entire body was comfortable and I felt reduced stress.  I was refreshed and energized after the practice.
5	Tai Chi with Kim Kubsch is so beneficial to my health, plus relaxing for my mind and body. As Mayo Clinic and Harvard Medical report, "Tai Chi is more effective and has fewer dangers or side effects than almost any other form of exercise." Kim's two easy and gentle Tai Chi DVD's are excellent to use at home or on vacation to ensure my balance and coordination stay strong everyday! - KA, Arizona

5	I know I can count on Kim to provide passionate, centering Tai Chi in an easy and gentle format. I always come away with less stress, renewed energy and general contentment. And when I don't have time for my private lessons with her, I use her two DVDs at home! The principles of balance, mindfulness and flow have permeated all aspects of my life since studying with Kim. - AT
