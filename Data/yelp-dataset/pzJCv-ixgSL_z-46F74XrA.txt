4	Fast and food as expected.
2	Well friendly service is about the only positive I can give for this location. I waited too long at the window for my food. No one was in the drive-thru, but service was slow enough for the guy to tell me "sorry for the wait." I had a hunch to check my order (something I do not practice routinely) and noticed they forgot my tacos. I got home about 7 min later to eat my food as soon as I arrived home, only to experience soggy food! Yuck! Boo hoo! I'll stick to home made tacos with a bag of Doritos on the side!
3	Pleasant service, however, you must nearly always expect a wait if you order from the "Pizza Hut" menu... you get a hot, fresh order, but if you're looking for "fast" food- stick with the "Taco Bell" menu...
4	We went to this location specifically for breakfast.  I did a head to head comparison of the sausage breakfast burrito by Taco Bell and that of McD's.  What I liked was that the burrito was bigger than Mc.D's they used real cheese and brand named sausage.  What I didn't like was that the burrito was bigger, it needed more filling or a smaller tortilla, one way or another.  It was also missing the onions and peppers.  My wife had the bacon crunch wrap and that was good as it was prepared.The best part of this visit, was the staff, they answered our questions, ask our opinion and listened.  The manager, David, had a Breakfast burrito made and added the Green Sauce to it, it was really good.  He also advised us that there is a new breakfast menu coming out to all the AZ Taco Bells soon and improvements have been made.  I can't wait to try the new menu, I feel they were on the right track with what they had, and hopefully will continue to get better.
