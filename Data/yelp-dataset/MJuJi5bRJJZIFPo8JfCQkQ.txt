3	At first the Auld Toll appears like a bar only for locals, it is not very attractive from the outside and always has its regulars smoking outside the door. However, on our way to a night out, I and my group of friends decided to pop in for a quick drink. The bar is on the left hand side, with seating areas on either side, with the left having some more private booths. The Auld Toll is not modern inside and is quite tired looking but since we went in for that drink, we have been back quite a few times! The staff are very friendly and chatty, which always adds to the atmosphere of any pub. Drinks are very reasonably priced, so it is a great place for students wanting to go somewhere before a club. There's a beer garden and a dart board, and there is even a juke box! The exterior of the Auld Toll does hide its charming character, its locals mingle with the young students, and provide lots of laughs! It might be auld but it certainly does have plenty of character to offer!

Firstly, I do this because they have several TV screens and, secondly, because it is a good pub.When you step inside, the first thing that will take you back is the traditional atmosphere.  The decor is quite simply spot on; I don't think you can fault it.  Added to that, it is good value for money and its patrons are very friendly.  It won't be very long before even the most awkward of visitors to this pub will be put at ease.  Once they are at ease they'll start to realise just how much of a gem this place is; a pub that delivers across the board.
