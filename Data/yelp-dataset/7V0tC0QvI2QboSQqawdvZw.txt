3	Pretty good little shop. I have checked several of them out on the strip. Their accessories are a favorite of mine. Lots of sparkly and fun ones to choose from and not very expensive prices. I check this place out from time to time when I'm in the area.
3	I first visited Marshall-Rousso a few years back when I was staying at the MGM and purchased a really cute cropped pleather jacket and these fabulous faux patent booties that I still get compliments whenever I wear them. Fast forward to my visit to the store located at The Venetian and I was again impressed with the fun shoe, handbag, and jewelry collection. I didn't really peruse the clothing very much but nothing seemed to stand out either. As a vegan, they offered many choices in both the shoe and handbag collection that were priced very well. I almost pulled the trigger on these phenomenal turquoise platform wedges but the fit of the shoe just didn't work for me. They were on trend and priced to sell at $60. Although the employees were helpful, there just didn't seem to be enough on staff.There just wasn't anything that I just had to have.TIP. Great selection of shoes are always on sale here!
4	Had never been here before, and walked out with two new dresses, and I actually paid full price for one of them, since it was so cute.  I will be looking for this brand again.
