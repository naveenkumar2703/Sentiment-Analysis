5	Justin Manning is really great, really great! When I started my practice I put myself in Justin's hands and I am perfectly happy. He has taken care of all the insurance needs that I brought to him. Wendy on the health insurance side is a rock star and everyone there has been there always within the hour when I have had an issue or inquiry. I also felt like Justin was supporting me rather than trying to sell me, which means a lot! Thank you guys, you did me right!

5	Wendy is the best insurance agent I've come across. She is very informative and has great attention to detail. She's someone that genuinely cares about her clients and will go to great lengths to help them. I had some medical insurance questions and she really helped me out. I felt like she went above and beyond to let me know everything she could, so that I could make the best decision. I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking for insurance.
