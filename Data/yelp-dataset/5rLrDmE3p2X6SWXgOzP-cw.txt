1	OMG, I'm the first to review this place.  My accountant is nearby, so we stopped here for breakfast.Let's just say I won't be going back - for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Who ever heard of ala carte breakfasts?  Order eggs and toast is a dollar extra?  Juice glasses are a bit larger than a shot glass.It's now after 1pm and my stomach is still gurgling!  Time for another dose of Pepto!
4	We went to this place on a Sunday morning.  They were only serving the breakfast buffet at the time, which is what we wanted anyway.  It was very good and had a decent amount of selections (the buffet) for a small, locally owned place.  The Garden Cafe even has a omelet bar that was very good.  The price is excellent for what you get.  I would much rather come here for a small buffet then go and spend another $3-5 more per person at Golden Corral for a lot of stuff I will not eat anyway.  Plus, eating here helps a local business.  We will be coming back a lot!
3	Ok good, but service was slow...maybe because I am a single woman...ignored by the waitress for 15 minutes the 1St time..10 minutes..this time...
5	Great friendly Staff. Always a smile and coffee when we sit down. This is not fine dining but  just plain good food. Sunday brunch is well worth the price. (especially the garlic macaroni!) For a local strip mall place to eat, this is it!
4	Stopped for breakfast. Door was open and allowing a nice breeze to come through. Got an omelette and toast and ordered a cinnamon role but the waitress forgot to write it down, which was fine cause I had no room for it. Cook delivered food to a table and got it wrong and yelled and complained about it behind the wall. It wasn't a big deal but he was very rude to the waitress and customers could hear him.
1	Closed and site is for lease. Hope someone who knows how to run a good restaurant takes it over.
