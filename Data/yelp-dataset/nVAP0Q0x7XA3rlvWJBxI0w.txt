5	Great service. Found them on yelp and wasn't disappointed! - also known as: A 1 Minute Key Service
5	Been using them for years, they have the best value I have found for onsite service.  I have used other mobile services in the past and have been charged way more than what ABC charges.  I have also been to their store quite a few times and it is nothing fancy but they have lots of locks and even used safes you can buy onsite.  They even work on cars, trucks, and any type of lock or safe at their location on 7th Avenue.
5	Great fast service! He arrived in less than ten minutes and had our car open instantly! Definitely recommend!  It cost $50 to unlock the car, and $60 if we had a credit card. Based on the four other places I called, I thought it was a great value for the service.
4	I've gone here a few times in the need of duplicates. I'm a fan because they were able to make copies of keys that others can't. They are fast and priced well.
