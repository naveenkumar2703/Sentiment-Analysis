1	Doctors were friendly  , but when explaining things they were very insulting to me I wasn't happy when I left there with my child and will look to find someone more caring in that aspect.
1	Tried your Gilbert office this morning, and wasted 45 minutes of time with a staff that is not trained to run an office. Appt was at 8, arrived 30 minutes early to be told that my appointment wasn't really until 8:20 because they require 30 minutes of paperwork. Well, 4 pages doesn't take 30 minutes. I completed your paperwork, and still, after 8am they were still not ready to take my two children, and had nothing to say for it other than "well, some of the other appointments are taking longer. Wouldn't you want to wait if it were your child?" No, I would not, which is why I arrived early, prepared, and was ready to go, unlike you and your staff. With so many dental offices in Gilbert, let alone Pediatric dental offices, I expected better. With children under 5, it should never take an hour unless there is a serious complication - which there is and was not. You will not be seeing my business again!
5	Dr Steve and his staff were very welcoming and we will continue to go to Kidtastic. They were thorough and made my children comfortable. Never did I feel like they were pushing services on us. Glad to have found a quality dentist near our home.
