2	Horton Electric installed a new 240V dryer outlet for me about a year ago.  It stopped working about a week ago.  Repeated phone calls and messages yielded no reply.  When I got a different electrician to look at it, he found that Horton had spliced together old aluminum wire with new copper wire in several places.  This lead to melted wire lugs, scorched junction boxes, and a real fire risk.  Two stars instead of one, because it lasted a whole year, I suppose.
5	Always reliable, trustworthy service. Excellent customer service-total professional.  Used them to install new can lights, ceiling fans and other fixtures when we lived in Phoenix up until 6 months ago.
