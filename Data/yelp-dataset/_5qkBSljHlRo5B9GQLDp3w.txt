4	Well here we are again visiting another lovely chain restaurant. I like to eat at subway when it is done right. This location is very clean, so is the staff if you know what I mean. They are friendly and courteous quick too. The ingredients at this location are very fresh, I cannot say the same for some of the other locations. I will give this one the thumbs up go ahead eat fresh lol!
4	Love Subway.
3	Four stars really?  it is fast food thousands of the same all over the country.  yes they make a quick decent sandwich but I wont give it four stars.. I wont go into detail on all the different sandwiches I have tried there I think 99% of the population knows what it tastes like already.  good for a quick cheap meal but not 4 star good..
4	this place gets FULL. but they work fast and they're friendly.
