5	I needed a last second cleaning after a party and these beautiful ladies did an amazing job. June was extremely helpful on the phone... they had no availability at first but she went out of her way and moved some things around to fit me in. I clean my own house usually but this time I was a bit overwhelmed and had time constraints... they might have made me a believer after this! They even left a bottle of wine for "the next party" HAH!I was blown away by this service.
5	As the old saying goes "You get what you pay for!". I shopped around and tried other services out before finally settling with CheckMaid. I got tired of dealing with other so called cleaning services that were flaky, inconsistent, and just unprofessional. CheckMaid does a great job every time they come and I happy to have found them. Tammy and Rebecca are always on time, at the precise time they say they will be there. They work thoroughly but quickly, and you can tell that they want to make sure everything is taken care of when cleaning.
5	I worked outside a lot, so my floors have gotten pretty dusty in the fewmonths I've lived in this apartment here in Phoenix. My parents are comingin to town this weekend so I made an appointment with Check Maid to havethem get all the dirt and dust from my wood floors and carpet, as well asgive the whole place a once over. I had not heard about them before, but acoworker mentioned that they did a good job at their house so I decided totake a chance. It turned out really well, the maids managed to get all thenasty stuff off my floors and even cleaned up stuff like the furniture thatI had expected to have to clean myself. Overall, I'm quite pleased with thejob they did, and it gives my parents one less thing to nag me about. Idon't get my place cleaned often, but the next time I do I'll definitely beusing Check Maid.
