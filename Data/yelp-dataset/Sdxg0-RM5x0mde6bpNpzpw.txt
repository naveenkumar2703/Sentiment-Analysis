5	The store has moved.  It is now located Dobson & Warner N.W. corner.The owner and her grand daughter were there when I went shopping Saturday.  Both ladies were very knowledgeable and very friendly.   They have a great selection of bras and undergarments.  The store is very comfortable and they even have a small play area for kids while mom can shop.
1	Trying to shop at this store for a bra for my 80 year old mother was an exruciating and miserable experience. Troubles began when the salesperson insisted my mother be fitted for a masectomy bra when she hasn't had a masectomy ! When we tried to express our concerns about the poor fit of the bras they were giving her to try on the 2 staff that were present were unresponsive to our concerns and rude. Needless to say we won't be returning. I would advise potential customers to reconsider where they would purchase their lingerie unless they can fit their own bras and don't expect any customer service. The needs of the customer are not a concern for the staff at this place of business.
3	Tried to stop by here today and found it empty, for lease, out of business.  That's a shame.
