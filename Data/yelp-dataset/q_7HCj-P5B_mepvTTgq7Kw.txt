5	This is my ultimate swanky lunch cafe. If you are looking for an ever-so-slightly overpriced sandwich salad or soup with a bit of southern California feel, then this is the place for you! Everything is basically a la carte, but worth it. The crowd is typically business folks on their lunch breaks, so don't even try to get quick service around noon. The sandwiches are all homemade recipes, and come with a bit more flavor than your regular sub or soup in a can...and they have italian sodas! Yay for that! Every month or so they feature a local artist on the walls too, so you can enjoy your sandwich and some nice artwork. When it is cool out, the patio is always packed. It's a bit hard to find because of its corner location, but look for it. You will not be let down.Recommended sandwich: The chicken salad on sourdough.Recommended salad: The baja. The avacado is so fresh everytime.Recommended drink: Strawberry Vanilla Italian soda with cream.

The environment was filled with paintings inside along with upbeat cafe jazz music piped through speakers.  Honestly, I've only tried one item from the cafe throughout the years; Steve's San Francisco.  Their sourdough was thick and very sour, almost like genuine Boudin.  The turkey with the avocado was the best.  I miss this place; I grew up with it.  Las Vegas really doesn't have anything like this.
