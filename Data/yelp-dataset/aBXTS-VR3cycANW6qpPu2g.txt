3	Basha is sort of like a Safeway, but not as great. We went here to do an alcohol run and also some chips and dips. The aisle were nicely organized and the workers were really helpful and friendly. Only problem is, they don't exactly have everything that we were looking for, which was really disappointing. They did not carry white cranberry juice and straws for mixed drinks. So we had to drive across the street to Albertson's where we were able to find both!
3	My least favorite grocery store to frequent, but it's the closest to my house. Their selection is really limited and their prices are high.  Friendly staff and always a clean store.
2	I would like to support Basha's, as they are an Arizona company, however, they rarely have what I'm looking for.  Today, they only had about 50% of the items on my list.  They had no organic canola oil.  When I asked at the pharmacy if they had anti-nausea bands, the gal said "We used to have them, let me check."  After a moment, she returned and said "I'm sorry, we don't have any.  I might be able to order some."  Um, thanks, but no, I kinda need them NOW.  They no longer stock the brand of shaving cream we use, nor did they have any Reach toothbrushes.  Also, their produce is frequently of poor quality.  Many of the oranges today were unripe.  The avocados were tiny and underripe.  Such a disappointment.
5	The pharmacy didn't have the prescription I needed in stock. I asked if they could see if another store in the area had it in stock, so I could go there to get it. I received a call two hours later letting me know that THEY had made the trip to the other store and had my prescription ready!  Talk about customer service!!!!I now only shop at Bashas and love the staff, the produce, the meat, etc.  it's a great place to shop!  They even provide childcare while you shop right inside the store.
