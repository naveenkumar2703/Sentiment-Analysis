4	Quick service! Clean.

1	Dude made me cheat his timer. Yeah, it was late (like 2am) but I know the game; you let him cheat the order timer and he hooks you up. Not this time. That's why I'm putting him on blast. No one answered the phone for two hours after I left so I turned to yelp. Either do things ethically or don't and pay the dues. That's how it works. If Miguel or whatever his name is doesn't want to play the game then I'm gonna tell the manager that he's cheating his numbers. The food was exceptionally bad plus I backed my car up so it looked like he was doing a good job timing wise. He did a poor job. That's it. This was at 2am 6/8/14.
