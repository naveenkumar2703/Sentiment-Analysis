3	This place is good for:  Cheap drinks.  Pool.  Darts.  Fried food.  Smelling the grease from the fried food that has apparently been sitting there since, oh, approximately 1987 and is probably still wearing acid wash jeans.  Not that grease can wear jeans, but that's beside the point.Magoo's is OK.  I mean, it's a bar.  They pour Skyy vodka as their well, which is a move up from the places I usually go to that are all Popov all the way, which is a ticket to Hangover City, Population: Me!  There's video poker and some fairly friendly barkeeps.  But the SMELL.  Holy crap, it's pervasive and just...just WEIRD.But man, once my roommate's dad got WASTED here and it was one of the best nights ever.  Everyone should go drinking with my roommate's dad.
3	This place kind of stinks. Literally. It smells funk-a-delic. Other than that, it's pretty much just a bar. They've got two pool tables that are kind of okay, and a juke box that kind of rawks. I'm usually the only chick in the joint, and the bartender, on several occasions, has had to tell one of the grumps at the bar, "Don't you say anything mean to her." Thank you, bartender.Still, I find myself here on occasion, when I just want to have a beer and I want it to be somewhere I can walk to. Actually, now that I think about it, I guess I only go to Magoo's out of necessity.
5	This is a cool spot to kick it at, if you like a layed back spot ..the jukebox is tight, and they got some pool tables and darts..Ive only been there twice, and I havn't came out broke when I leave, so thats a good thing. Draft. Big One.   ;)
