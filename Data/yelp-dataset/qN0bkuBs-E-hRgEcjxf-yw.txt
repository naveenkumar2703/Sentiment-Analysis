3	First of all, service is great & there's quite a selection. Kay, the owner, is knowledgeable but her tone is harsh...but don't let that scare you. Their prices are quite high compared to Wilshire Wigs (online & in CA)...double on the 2 wigs I bought. However, if you need advice with color selection, style & trimming...it's worth the extra $; if not, search at US but save lots of $ at Wilshire.
5	This is by far the best wig shop I have ever been too. The customer service is awesome and there very low pressure, great selection of wigs and every time I go in they have alot of new inventory.  Us wigs has a vast selection of blonde wigs which I really like.
5	Stopped in yesterday because a new position I have taken doesn't take kindly to my teal hair. So, I needed something to wear to work. Matt was exceptionally helpful in showing me options, I was especially indecisive and had no idea where to start, but after a few min. Matt had me in the right direction and I picked an awesome wig!
5	Best wig store ever. Nice prices. Very nice owners. Nice quality wigs. The owners really help you. They know what will look good on you and what won't. They've picked out my favorite wigs before I even tried them on.
4	Great selection for inexpensive wigs. The staff is very helpful and the older asian women is hilarious
5	Matt was so very helpful and professional today. He was very patient with me in finding the right wig. He brought be plenty of options and made it very easy for me to decide. I will be back again. Love their selection
