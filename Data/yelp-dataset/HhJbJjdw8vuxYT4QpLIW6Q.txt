1	Advertised Botox $6.99 - too good to be true???   Yes!!Botox did not take effect even after the two weeks Doctor promised.  I have talked to other ladies and they are having the same effect----Nothing.  Do not waste your money girls.
1	If I could give a lower rating I would.  I was there for the HCG 4 week weight loss program that I saw advertised in a flyer.  The program, I learned on the final day, was actually only three weeks.  I had done the HCG program at a different place a few years ago and it was much more extensive and much less expensive.
5	If you really care about your health and want a sincere doctor who honestly cares about his patients and believes in his practice, then this is the doctor for you. I am a 40-year-old woman who couldn't be happier with the care I have received and how I feel after seeing Dr. E for the past year. I recommend Dr. E to all my friends and family and the ones who actually listen have been very happy with their care as well. In response to Lisa N., it is possible that you are one of the few people who is immune to Botox and similar products, which is to no fault of the doctor. I too was extremely unhappy with subsequent treatments given by another doctor only to find out that no amount of the toxin would ever be effective for me because my immune system works too well. Ironic, isn't it? You should always do your homework when looking for a new doctor, especially when you know exactly what type of treatment you are seeking. For example, if you are simply interested in the HCG diet program instead of overall health and you had been elsewhere for less money then likely that place is a better match for you. We don't live forever, but we can live better while we are here. Take control of your medical care, it's your body and therefore your decision. Dr. E at Carefree Health Path is a great place to start your empowering journey to health.
