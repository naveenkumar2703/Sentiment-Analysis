3	Like the fact that this is a combined babies r us and toys r us. Makes it easy to shop for the baby and the toddlers in the family. They have a good selection of baby strollers, car seats, and all your baby needs, though sometimes they may not have the color or pattern you want. Recently discovered the baby clothes section and love the koala kids stuff. On the toys side they have all the toys your kids want, though I often think toys r us is more expensive than say Walmart or target but on the plus side toys usually has more of a selection to choose from.
4	Sometimes the sales advertised isn't what you expected but spending the next 20 minutes of your life trying to get the deal you want isn't worth the trouble.  I think they know that so they make the advertisements purposely obscure!  Having spent a pretty penny at this place for our kiddo's needs and wants is an understatement.  I like how the Babies R Us and Toys R Us are connected.  Makes getting things to get easier.  It's generally well stocked but at times a little messy.  The staff is generally nice and helpful.  Make sure you do price checks ... they hardly ever have the best deal unless u use one of their coupons.
3	I went today which is a Sunday,  not to busy and store was clean. The only thing that was annoying was that their was only one register open and the wait was about 7 min when I only spent about 10 min in the store.
1	I had a very good experience there today. Three three employees help us with our purchase today. The male employee Marcus really went above and beyond. Marcus went out of his way to find a toy gun my son want it and searched and searched and finally found. This is the second time in two weeks that I had a very good experience.
