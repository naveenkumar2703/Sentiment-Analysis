5	This place is an absolute gem!  The vibe is warm and inviting by both the instructors and students.  I am always greeted by name and feel like they really are happy to see me.  The variety of classes and teaching styles is helpful in maintaining a balanced practice.  It is so great to have a place to go where the yoga is AFFORDABLE!  You should definitely check it out.
5	Studio Santosha is the BEST studio in the west valley. Give it a try. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. The instructors are well trained and knowledgable and there are a variety of styles to choose from depending on what you are looking for. They have a beverage snack and bar where you can help yourself. Arrive early and hang out on the comfy couch before your class.
4	Their 4pm yoga class is amazing. It is a great way to start your weekend.
5	Great place! My first visit was yesterday and I took Amber's slow yoga class with a friend. I'm actually sore today! I worked up quite a sweat in the 75 min class. Fantastic stuff. So happy I was introduced to studio santosha yoga. This studio has a nice variety of classes, slowly but surely I will embrace them;)
5	I highly recommend Studio Santosha. The studio offers a variety of classes and workshops for everyone, even doggies!
5	I love  Studio Santosha!  They have a great schedule!  Being a busy working mom, it's difficult to find ideal times for classes.  They have classes that could fit any schedule and all the instructors are fabulous!  I've also seen an improvement with back pain and migraines since taking the classes.  Check them out.  You'll be glad you did.
4	This is my home studio and I'm just beginning my practice so I really like the Yin and Nidra sessions the best.  I find that the instructors are all very warm and open and helps me to leave the world behind when I'm on my mat.  I'm grateful for the introduction and continued practice.
