4	I've been going to Unique since I was little.... when it was called Chic n' Cheap. I always find at least one decent thing at Unique. Granted it doesn't have tons of great stuff, but it is a great stop on a shopping day. And this isnt a psudeo thrift store that more of a vintage store and therefore can charge non-thrift prices. I'm talking shirts under a dollar. yeah.
3	low end thrift shopping at its best. Cheap...cheap..cheap thats the way we like it
3	Yikes... this is definitely one of the more seedy thrift stores.  The smell alone is enough to knock a weaker woman off her feet, and certainly not in a good way.  In any event, it's a pretty decent place.  There are lots of fun things to look at and consequently, make fun of.  Last time we were here we found a lamp made out of a fake toolbox and fake tools.  The funny thing is, we almost bought it.  When it comes down to it, there isn't much different between this store and a goodwill except that you can probably spend a few less dollars here.
1	This store is long gone and its part of the building has been torn down. If you go here, you will find a construction zone, and then in the future, you will find whatever's being built. But I doubt it will be the smelly dive that was Unique Thrift.
