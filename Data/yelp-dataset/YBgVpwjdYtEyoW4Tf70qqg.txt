4	I really enjoy lunches from this little cafe. They have a really terrific gyro salad and it's HUGE! They always recognize me when I go in, greet me with smiles and make me feel special. They are a bit hidden in the strip mall location. They could be easily missed if you aren't aware they are there.They also have delicious bagels and pistachio baklava!!!! Oh and they have hookah and belly dancing some evenings.
3	Super friendly. Low on atmosphere. Good food. Fabulous baklava. Not the most fabu place but it's really good middle eastern food served by really nice people.
4	Love this friendly little place.  Ran by a Lebanese family who is always really friendly and remember me.  Great Gyros and tea here.  On request they use a special spicy sauce I believe native to Lebanon which is great.They can also sell other specialty items by request (if made in advance) if you have a craving for something off menu.  Definately a zillion times better and more authentic than "Gyro time".There is outdoor seating in the strip mall area which is nice for April/Sept temperature in Vegas :)  Always a plus.
