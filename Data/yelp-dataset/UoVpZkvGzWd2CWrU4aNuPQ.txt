5	Corina and Cutter Aviation are wonderful! She gave my 3 yr old the full airport & airplane tour. He loved it. Thank you Corina!
5	I've been here a few times when transporting patients. The staff is super friendly and they always have snacks (like cookies) and coffee available. The waiting area is nice and very comfortable. The bathrooms are always posh and super clean. The last time we went, the staff actually drove us too and from our hotel in a big SUV (lots of room for our luggage and all the people we were with). They were happy to accommodate us. I look forward to working with Cutter in the future.
5	Fantastic Jet Center !!!  the Pilot lounge is like a luxury theater.Big ass chairs, lots of bottled water. MONSTER TV ....They are always happy to come grab you from the commercial terminal and bring you over. Pretty good crew car availability.
