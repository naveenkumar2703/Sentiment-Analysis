4	Great location and great subs if you are into healthy eating. I have to eat Subway once a week so I can be like Jared.
4	I've written probably 5 reviews on 5 different Subways, and they are all pretty much the same. That's a good thing.
5	I was running some Errands out in Gilbert and it was far past lunch time. So I thought, I will stop at the next place I see.There it was Subway located inside a strip mall. As soon as I walked in I noticed how clean it was. There were several customers inside and it was nicely decorated.I really do not know how long it has been there since I do not get out here too often. But, now with all the new building it is getting very busy out in these parts.Anyway, Vijay was my sandwich maker. He did a great job. One thing they do not carry Gluten Free, which is something I think everyone should go to now. I got the Philly Steak Sandwich and you can get anything you want on it which I think is great!  He even toasted it for me. Napkins are not out so you have to ask for them.  I keep noticeing this in a lot of places. I don't know why, but I hate not having enough.  However, he gave me more and I was on my way. Food tasted fresh and that is all I ask for.Lots of parking in the lot. I wish they still did the punch cards for Subway, but I know that went away a long time ago.
3	I've been to the Subway on Gilbert Road several times now for breakfast.  The service is good and the people behind the counter are very attentive but their toasting oven is a little tired.  If you order the breakfast sandwich with egg, bacon and cheese on flatbread you need to ask them to toast it twice because if you don't, you'll probably get egg that is cold in the middle .. yuke! .. the good news is that if you make that request they don't hesitate and they do it for you .. they really need a new toaster over in my opinion.
