5	Sleepy Wilson's BBQ catered my sons birthday party. We had ribs, chicken wings, pulled pork, potato salad, macaroni & cheese and homemade lemonade. Everyone commented on how great the food was because it is very authentic BBQ. They had sauce on the side for the ribs and that was a big hit too. I loved that they brought everything they needed to set up the food and that they made it look great.
5	Delicious food. The Wilson burger and pulled pork sandwich are my favorites.
5	great little carry-out joint.  the food is amazingly awesome.  the chopped pork is sooo juicy and the ribs fall right off the bone.  i am soooo glad this place opened.  we usually go once a week to get our bbq fix.
5	So amazing, i love wings and prefer them spicy. But these bbq wings were so good i almost ate the whole tray. I don't live in lv, but i will be back! This is a fast food location and worth the money. Service is great, food is awesome... Try them out and bring a friend! Request the sweet potato fries :)
