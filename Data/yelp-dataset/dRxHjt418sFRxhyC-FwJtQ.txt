3	JetBox is one of the new food vendors in Terminal 4.  As I have not traveled out of Terminal 2 or 3, I do not know if there are other locations.  It is mostly food on a tortilla, and that being prepared mostly offsite and served hot here.The basic burrito, with grilled veggies, guacamole and sour cream struck me as about right for a recent meal at the airport.  I did not feel like chicken or beef, so asked for the above combination.  When register chickie rang it up, it was a burrito with chicken, a $9 plus offering.  On asking register chickie how she could justify a charge for a chicken burrito, she responded that it was the cheapest burrito on the menu.I asked to speak with the manager.  He came forward and advised that register chickie was correct, this was the cheapest burrito offering on the register keypad.  When I asked him to justify the chicken, he thought a minute and had register chickie change the order to a hot dog.  While meat was still in the "order", the price reflected a $3 discount.Thanks for hearing me out and seeing the logic in my assertion.
1	Ordered a chicken burrito here on Friday, June 28th.  Onset of FOOD POISONING was swift and severe.  Spent Saturday pretty much bed-ridden.
2	9.90 for a cold wrap with tax. So much for street prices. The wrap was ok but the price is more than most of the better restaurants
