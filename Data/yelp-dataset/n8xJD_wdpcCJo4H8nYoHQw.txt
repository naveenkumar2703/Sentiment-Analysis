4	They had a few aisles of kitchen cabinets priced anywhere from $500 through $2000 (the whole set). Some of them were pretty nice also. You can save a pretty penny if you want to make changes in your home by buying things from here for the renovations, updates etc. The store has a open warehouse feel to it. There was tons of stuff still in their boxes and looked brand new. It seemed that some people might have ordered wrong things etc and decided to donate it if it was non-refundable. Lots of indoor lightling, some plumbing fixtures, tons of sinks, toilets and tubs. The individual did say that sometimes they get things from Paradise Valley also and so does their Glendale store on Camelback. He also mentioned that the best day of the week to shop there was on Thursdays because that is when they get most of their things in.
5	i've been here numerous times. it's very hit or miss. if i knew how to hang cabinets, this would be my store. they have some good stuff, lots of old, not really any good stuff. i've heard people have found top of the line appliances on some occasions. this trip we found box of mexican tiles for 15 bucks (at lowe's they cost 4 bucks each), and an old gate that we plan to take apart and make into a bar. like i said, sometimes they have good finds and sometimes not. they also take drop-offs mon-sat. Bring a truck because some of the stuff you might buy is very large!
5	I know it is non-profit.  It is good for the environment.  I know this place creates value out of what other people may be throwing away.  Aside from all the altruistic aspects of this business being green and finding use for waste, the reason I love Stardust Building Supply is because they have saved me $1000s of dollars.   There are basically two ways this place can help you:FIRST:If you are tearing something down to update or replace and you need to get rid of the old stuff.  Although it still works, you know you cannot store it.....Most  tend to throw things away.   A few loads to the dump, can and does cost $100s, but you shouldn't!  Stardust will come and take half of your things and save you $100s in dump fees and you get a tax break!!!......REALLY!SECOND:If you are building something: - a.  You need an in-home a dance studio and need a wall of mirrors, go to Stardust....pay $45 for your wall of mirrors instead of $2000.   - b.  New Cabinet doors.....Stardust. - c.  White Whirlpool microwave stopped working the day your warranty expired and don't want to pay $300 for a new one.  Get the exact same model a Stardust for a third.   - d.  Decided you should upgrade to 6 panel interior doors when it costs you less than $300 installed because of Stardust had them on the floor.  Stardust takes requests too!  If they don't have what you want in inventory, they will put an astrick in the computer and call you when it does come in.....YES!!!I have used Stardust for all of the above scenarios, these are real stories for myself over the last few years.  Stardust seems to be run by handymen, so if you need a handyman for these projects, ask, and they may be able to refer you to someone who is reputable.        Stardust is a great resource and I am truly excited about how and what they have to offer.  I apologize about sounding like a used car salesman as I write this, but my enthusiasm is authentic.
1	If I could I would give it negative stars. We talked to the manager at the mesa store and told him we were redoing our kitchen. They were going to come take the cabinets and counter tops out but couldn't get to it in time, so I removed all the cabinets and counter tops myself. I loaded everything on a trailer so we could take them there. We told him that one of the cabinets (sink) had water damage. They said no problem bring them by. When we got there to unload the cabinets Bob looked at them and said the he doesn't know why we brought them down and said they would trash them anyway. He was very rude and acted like we were troubling him to do his job. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED with my whole experience with them. Would rather take all my stuff to the dump than back there.
