4	Morty's Shop is next door to the Tattoo shop I work at, so I've been eyeballing his TV's for quite some time. He's a super nice guy and very knowledgeable and his prices are great so I wanted to give him business when it came time to finally buying a TV. I got a used Toshiba 26" flat screen TV with built in dvd player for $150. The thing works beautifully, Only a few surface scratches. His selection is always changing, when I went he had sold a bunch that day so there wasn't that many to choose from, but fortunately he had exactly what I was looking for.  He told me I could wait till Thursday when he was going to get a tonne of new tv's in but I really didn't need to wait.   However if you go, ask him if/when he's getting his next shipment if there isn't a lot of selection, it'll probably be just a few days down the road. I will recommend this shop to anyone looking to buy a TV. it was a great experience.
5	Seriously, one of the best shopping experiences I've had. He was knowledgeable, friendly, and interested in the customer. You cannot find service like this anywhere anymore. Not only that but I saved a ton of $$$, we are talking hundreds of dollars, on NEW hardware for mounting tvs, he gave us amazing deals, those big chain stores cannot compete with his prices even with their best sales. If I ever need  anything else for a TV I will be ordering it form him, no matter where i live. I'm just happy i took a chance on a small local place like this.
1	2 TVs in 3 weeks. The first one lasted 2 days, the second one two weeks. The first time I walked in the guy was nice and friendly. When I exchanged the first TV he had a bad attitude. What a waste of money. I guess you get what you pay for. Apparently no refunds only exchanges. So now I'm stuck hauling TVs back and forth every month. Awful experience
