2	After 9 on a Monday night, even during The Festival, is probably not the time to see this place at its best but then on the otherhand its hardly likely to be high class dining at the best of times, as I've yet to experience one of its kind that's more than functional. A good and wide selection of starters, main courses & desserts seem to be available although at the time of night I visited they're understandably not all replenished continuously. A small selection of sushi was also evident although neither myself or my companion sampled this. All in all then on a par with Jimmy Chung's & the others of its ilk - a means to an end.
