5	I just had another tire replaced by Zen Moto. I love these guys! Quality work at a good price, real craftsmanship.
5	Thanks for taking great care of my bikes. These guys are amazing. Knowledge, super service and reasonable price. You just can't do better than this shop.
5	Moved out from California a couple of years ago and had been looking for a shop where you can shake the owner/mechanics hand and know that you are paying him directly for the services provided.  This is the place.  Carbs serviced on a ninjette, CBR lowered for the wife, tires installed (Michelin sends me birthday cards because I buy so many).  Dillon is spot on and I'll continue to take my bikes to him.
5	Will come here again! Really good customer service and very good work on my gsxr 750
