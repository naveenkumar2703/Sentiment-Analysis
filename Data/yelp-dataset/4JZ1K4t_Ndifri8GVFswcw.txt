3	I have to agree with Alice on this one, it is really slow in here. I will say that the bartenders did go out of there way to come over to my table to see what I wanted...probably because no one else was there!Drinks were cheap enough and I imagine on a Saturday night the place fills up with locals and it's great fun. But during the week, eerily quiet...
