5	The best massage on the west side and great prices. The therapists cater appropriately to your needs, focusing on the healing and relaxation of your body. Friendly owners and great ambiance with the music and lighting. 60+ minute massages come with a warm/hot water tub to soak and sooth your feet while your receive a scalp and upper body massage. Following is the foot reflexology, where the muscles are relaxed at intricate points to the pressure of your comfort. Finally, legs, back, and neck to again, the pressure of your liking. Additional services include hot towel wash after the massage. I go in tense and come out completely refreshed! Enjoy!

4	Really great value for the money. The staff is polite, and professional. I will be back for sure the next time I am in town. I foot massage was so relaxing that I fell asleep.
5	Wow! An excellent experience!  Just got home from there to write this review.  I'm still tingling all over.  For the price, I highly recommend. The staff was superb. I will definitely recommend to all, and YES, I will be back. Almost forgot, I was a walk-in too and got in right away!
5	If I could give them 100 stars I would. I had Denny this time and it was the greatest massage I've ever had. He hit every pressure point in my body. He really knows his stuff. I feel very relaxed and I will be seeing him more often
5	Forget massage envy. Had a horrible migraine going on occasionally this whole year and was prescribed prescription strength meds. The massage from this place helped a lot. It's super affordable which I like. Buy their oil too. My Chinese family has a bunch of these oil lol. Will be coming back.
