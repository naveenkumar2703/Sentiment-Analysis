3	Typical Mattress place. Big open floor plan with lots of beds to sit on and try out. The guys what work there are pretty cool and not pushy like other places. We are looking for low profile box spring and they were able to present several good options and suggest a few places to look at in addition to them. I think we are just going to wait and get a whole new mattress set after the wedding though... so I can't tell you about their after purchase service.
1	I will say our experience in store was great, we weren't pushed into anything we didn't want. They have a decent selection of low to high end mattresses.  We were able to get our mattress quick, I believe it was next day.  The delivery guys were cool and polite. However, when they were unwrapping the one box spring(we got a king) it was different then the other one. When we asked the delivery guys, they played dumb like they didn't notice it!  We called the salesman we dealt with who convinced us it was the same box spring, just a different fabric. It was funny how the tune changed from when we were in the store. In the store, we were getting the upgraded box spring according to the salesman.  After a few calls to the store to get the correct, matching box spring, we got nowhere. That seems to unfortunately be the theme with companies these days. Get your money, and customer service stops. We bought the most expensive mattress they had, I expected better service.
1	Beware of there Comfort Exchange Policy it is not that comforting. The Sales Manager Shawn is like a used car salesman. He will tell you anything you want to hear and give big discounts to by the mattress but if there's a problem oh well. By the time you pay the exchange penalty and handling charges and the cost difference of a different mattress that they won't deal on you could buy the same mattress for less at another store. I urge you to shop somewhere else, the after sales service is awful at best.
