5	Great variety of yummy smoothies with great service.
5	I love my Aloha Pineapple, but I hate bananas! Every JJ I've visited is happy to substitute the bananas for more strawberries - yum! This location is clean and the staff is friendly.
5	FYI: Google/Yelp renders the location incorrectly, it's actually about a mile south of where it appears making this a difficult location to check-in at. It's in the shopping center just south of the 202 next to Ono's Hawaiian BBQ. Bing maps this address correctly, Google will if you change the Address to Gilbert 85236.
5	Besides the tasty smoothies, which have improved in quality and variety over the years, this Jamba Juice has consistently friendly staff. Thanks!
4	Jamba juice is always good, but a little pricey for their product
5	My favorite place to get a fruit smoothie. This Jamba Juice specifically has great service. They are fast and friendly and always get my order correct.
1	I love Jamba Juice... Just not this one on Power Road. I've given the place three tries after they completely botched my order the first time. They never get it right. Plus, the staff here was always super rude.
