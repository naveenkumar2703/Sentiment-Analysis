4	Near the Altell Ice Den on Bell road. There's a few exceptional details about this gas station/convenience store... There's a full service car wash and detailing service, and if you are waiting on one of these services, there's a guest lounge you wouldn't believe-  HD tv's (not just one), all leather furniture, free wi-fi, and you can view the work being done on your car through the window. The convenience store is huge, clean, and hardly ever a crowd. Wide variety of sodas and beer, as well as the usual soda fountains and fast food to go. You'll find a 15 door 'fridge with wines, champagnes, and beer. No need for Starbucks, as there's a coffee bar here. There's even a cafe in this joint, with excellent breakfast burritos that are giant, delicious & cheap! The other food is really good as well. Outside, they are the only place I've seen in the Valley that carries 100 octane (racing) fuel, which we've put in our boat a few times! No 5 star rating because the gas isn't cheap here, but this is a unique spot definitely worth a stop in!
1	The location has closed (AGAIN).  Not good if you have prepaid washes or other credits as the business has closed.  Some speculation on other sites is that they have filed for bankruptcy again.Don't bother stopping by to use their services as the facility is cordoned off and a big sign says "business closed".
