1	The food is ok(for Mcdonalds), but the service is some of the worst I have ever received at any Mcdonalds, They are also out of everything, and I have been ignored the two times I have been in there, Horrible service.  Hopefully this is due to being a new store and they work some of this out.
5	Friendly staff. I miss McDonalds. Stupid diet. I snuck in and had a double cheeseburger. Don't tell my wife.
1	This "new" location is worse than the one that closed down, down the street. The other day I asked for a McCrib & the drive thru attendant went on and on about how they don't have it till next week & that it isn't real meat & it doesn't have real BBQ sauce & questioned me why I would want that sandwich to begin with! I came back the next day & a different drive thru attendant was equally rude! If I could, I would give them zero stars.
5	Fairly new building so modern with plenty of room. Lots of windows so lots of light. Kept clean.
3	I prefer this location due to the fact it's clean,efficient,and the employees are courteous.   I've never encountered any issue's with my food, but be aware that sometimes that certain employee's may NOT understand certain words due to the fact English is NOT their first language.
