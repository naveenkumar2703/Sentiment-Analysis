3	The NEW bar in the anticlimatic NEW section of the Hard Rock is..well...anticlimatic when you look at it. It's the not as hot sister to the circle bar that still holds tight to its flocks of plastic people and the occasional local that may be just as plastic who knows..HOWEVER when I went to check itout sober last night so I could remember it this time. The bartenders on graveyard are funny, they have seen it all. My girlfriend and I had a very old drunk black man yelling over the music to us in what might (?) have been english...not really too sure. BEST PART OF ANY NIGHT EVER-- not even after finishing our 1st (and only) beer a guy in a silky shiny kimono top came right up to us almost straddling my friends leg and asked us,"Do you guys have any oranges back there?" Huhwhatdude? "Orange...es?...No? OK sorrry" and briskly walked away. Still don't know if thats like a drug code or he may just have been on some..For the highest concentration of freaks ( didnt even name em all just the best) I have ever seen while drinking 6 oz. of beer on a Thursday night I would say go here! I couldn't even take it I drank the rest of my beer on my own brisk walk to the parking garage. Whay to go Hard Rock, you have really made my day.
4	Hung out here for a few hours during our brief Staycation.  I like how there are plenty of big screen tv's on the bar so you can watch ESPN or games while you have a few drinks.  We went with the House Cab ($9).....it's not too bad.Of course there are video poker and slot machines on the bar for those who like to gamble.  I no longer gamble, so I didn't play any games.One of the other great things about this bar is it's great for people watching.  There's plenty of foot traffic around the bar and of course it's the Hard Rock.....always good times.Return Factor - 95%
