5	Looking for a light dessert and a place to sit and watch the characters in Las Vegas? This is great place.
3	It's fine!  A tiny place tucked in a corner of an open air mini mall right on the LV Strip.  The usual flavor choices, nothing exotic and not a huge selection.  They only had one size cup the day I went--giant bowl, BEWARE of overindulgence .  Waffle cones are also available.  Like with the flavors topping choices were somewhat limited IMO.  Pricing is by the ounce and not bad; two bowls filled a little more than halfway each set us back about $8.  A decent alternative to nearby pricier options.
1	Went in at 8:55 and the girl said they closed at 8:45 and the machines were already turned off. Went to walgreens and picked up some pints for my kids instead.
1	Went in at 8:45 - they close at 9. The girl behind the counter said the yogurt was open but the toppings were closed. They were right there, but not available. That's just laziness. It's a pass.
2	Limited flavors and super pricey ( 55 cents per ounce? ) Definitely not worth it ( even with the 10% yelp discount off)
