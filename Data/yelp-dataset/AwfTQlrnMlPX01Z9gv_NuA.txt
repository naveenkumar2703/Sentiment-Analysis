3	Great place. I really liked the pedi. Average, yes, but a good value.
4	I'm a fan! I've been coming to Pink Gelish Nails since they opened, literally. They had been opened 24 hours when I went in for my first spa mani/pedi. Arizona is tough on feet and Kristine did a great job on my calluses, making my feet beautifully soft again. I did a French mani/pedi the first time that lasted 3 weeks easily. Each time I go back, Kristine has done something completely different for each of the holidays. I'm always asked where I get my nails done. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed!
5	I like this place. Good prices and good services
1	This is the worst nail salon I've ever been to.  The techs are amateur and the male tech that did my pedicure was so lame, by day 2 after my pedi my toes looked awful!  I don't recommend this place at all!
