4	Can always find what I need for my hair at a great price!! An my Sally's card always saves me some cash !!! Now if I can only figure out how to work all the nail stuff :)
2	I went to the store for the first and was greeted right away. I was asked if I needed help and I tried to explain what I was looking forward to try to go back to my natural hair color. The lady was not very helpful and was somewhat rude. I tried to ask questions make sure I got the right product she just seemed as if I was a nuisance. Then another lady asked if I needed help when I showed her the products I had and asked if it was correct she looked at me like I was retarded. I was very frustrated because this was my first time dying my hair outside of the cheapie box and I  just looking for a little help. There's absolutely no need for both of these ladies to be extremely rude to me when all I was doing was being a customer and asking simple questions about products they had.The good thing I have to say about this store is it was reasonably priced and my hair did turn out nicely.
5	This Sallys location is my absolute favorite. The women who work there are so beyond helpful! I was asking them questions about dying my hair and they spent a good 20 minutes giving me helpful tricks and even showing me different techniques to highlight. They're very honest and always point you toward the right products.
