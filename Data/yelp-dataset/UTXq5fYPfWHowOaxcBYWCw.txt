5	What a fantastic surprise!  Shona helped me with the menu and was an absolute joy to talk to about Scottish food.  I had the haggis with neeps and tatties and it was all amazing.  She also sent a Scottish pie with me as I was interested in trying that as well.  My family and I were able to sample it that evening (wonderful) and I would also recommend trying that.  I was very fortunate that I went for lunch a bit after 2 in the afternoon in late November, so it was relatively quiet inside, and Shona and I  had great conversation about travelling in the United States as well as cultural differences between the States and Scotland.  Please take my advice and visit this place for a great Scottish meal with great service and conversation!!!
3	there should be well more reviews about this quirky little cafe near the castle! I came with a few people and they seated us all and the man serving us was a right laugh! The only annoying thing was, they'd run out of chicken salad so I just had a vegetable soup instead! Tasty!
1	Gee whizz! This place has got to be joking. They just served me a mince and tatties microwaved ready meal. Absolutely staggering.Words fail me. Well, one springs to mind: avoid.
4	Ran into this little cafe for a brunch. Ordered the Scottish breakfast for less than 8 pounds. Very large portion with haggis, black pudding, potato scones, ham, bacon, egg, tea, toasts. Everything tasted quite good and the owner was very friendly. I was very full and would say this place was good for the price.
