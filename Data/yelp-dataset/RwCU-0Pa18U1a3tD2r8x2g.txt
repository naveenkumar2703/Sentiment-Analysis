5	As a real estate broker salesperson, I've referred a handful of solar screen companies to my clients, and the only company that I only hear GREAT things about is Solar Screen Warehouse!From what my clients say they are "Friendly and professional" and "Easy to work with" and "Do not try to sell you more than you really need" and "Finished product is beautiful". For me the votes are in....Solar Screen Warehouse will be the only company I refer from now on!
5	I would recommend this co. to anyone. Had my entire house done with solar screens. Color matches my house perfect and looks beautiful. We have gone through 1 summer so far and they don't look a day older from when I had them installed. Owner if company personally visited my house to inspect the work after they were installed! You don't see that very often at all. Great job!
5	Mike was really great. He came to our house to give us an estimate the same day we called him. We got a few other estimates but his was the lowest and he was the most professional. They were done in a week and they they did a great job installing them and they look fantastic. We can't believe how much heat they block out. We wish we would have done this sooner. I highly recommend them for your solar screen needs.
5	I usually don't write reviews, but when you get GREAT service with a great deal, you feel compelled to say something.  It doesn't cost anything to get a quote.  If you're looking for solar panels, why not get a quote from an A+ business.  Trusted vendor, quality service, fast delivery -- what else could you want.  Very impressed.
