1	I called to have an estimate of a carpet kit install and got off the phone in a rage.  Not only did the woman barely speak english, but talked down to me as if I did not know how complex gluing carpet into a car could be.When I asked for clarification on how the quote worked (if it was a flat fee or hourly rate) I was told that they did not need my business and that I could go somewhere else if I had any other questions.Stay away from this shop as they will treat you like dirt before you are even a customer.
5	Teresa is a most courteous professional.  She has been in the business for 15 or 20 years.  I received a very reasonable quote and the work was delivered on time.A great place.
5	We had our patio chairs (6) of them recovered in Sunbrella material....They did a great job at a very reasonable price.  I know they have been in business here for a very long time and in the same location also for a long time.  If you know what you want...they can help you but they are not decorators but have material samples for you to choose from.  I give them 5 stars for what they do and they don't pretend to be anything they are not....I give the other reviewer a one star or less for lack of tolerance and for not choosing the kind of shop or service for his kind of job.....no I am not related to the people from this upholstery shop!
