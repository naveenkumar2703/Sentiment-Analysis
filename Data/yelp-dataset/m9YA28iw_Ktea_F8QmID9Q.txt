5	This macarons are a little piece of heaven.  The flavors are all very tasty; my favorite is the caramel flavor.  The cookie portion is a bit crunchy and soft and then the caramel just melts in your mouth. I love the box for the macarons because of the little peek a boo hole on the top.
5	This is definitely my favorite joint for macarons!  The "cookie" part is crunchy yet soft...I LOVE LOVE the texture. They are a bit larger than other macarons that I've bought from other places. I do wish however that you could pick and choose what you wanted, since sometimes I'm not in the mood for the lemon or the rose flavored macarons.Overall this place is a winner to me and I know I will be back! You definitely should eat these the day of because the next day the macaron gets a bit hard but its still delish!
5	I'm so glad that I found this vendor at the Farmer's Market. Their macarons are so heavenly...crunchy first bite...then chewy...then you get the delicious center. I agree with the other reviewer...I wish that I could choose the flavors but its ok, the other flavors are just as awesome. The price is reasonable and they size are just right. I recommend the macarons to everyone.
5	Best macaroons in Vegas!  Fresh, not dry and just right size.
