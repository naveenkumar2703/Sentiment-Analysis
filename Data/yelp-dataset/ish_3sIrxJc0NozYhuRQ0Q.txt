5	I compared the prices of multiple mobile grooming services in Vegas.  Cloud 9 had the best prices and no extra "trip charges" or "de-matting fees."  They even include toothbrushing with the price.  Their prices were actually equivalent to what I would pay at a traditional grooming shop.They groomed my small dog and afterwards she looked great!  I will continue to use this service for regular grooming of my dog.
2	Im sure its a great service. However, the website claims appointments usually within the week. I called, they said 5 weeks out, so good luck with that!! Its summer now, my cat needs to be sheared before she melts, not by sometime in August!
1	Don't bother making an appt with this company, they don't keep them & the owner will argue with you when you try to get to the bottom of  why the appointment you made 12 weeks in advance is being changed to a different time.
