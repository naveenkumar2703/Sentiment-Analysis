5	Sports injuries (or injuries of any kind, for that matter) are no fun. I had a surgery on my ankle when I was a senior in high school and my sister was in and out of the OR with knee problems for eight or nine years.Dr. Zeman handled both of us and it was as pleasant an experience as it could possibly have been. Mine was a one time and out, once my physical therapy was over my ankle was healthy and it has been ever since. My sister's repeat injuries were a result of her continued participation in tennis, and then a reflare from a ski crash. Dr. Zeman was always helpful and courteous, and he even was flexible with his schedule to accommodate us, which isn't common among sports medicine docs. Most definitely one of the best in the valley, if not country, and easiest to deal with.
5	A friend of mine referred me to Dr. Zeman and I'm SO happy she did. I had this knee scoped back in 06 from another ortho doc in town and it was horrible. This experience is how it should be! I wished I would of known Dr. Zeman back then. I probably wouldn't be in this situation again if I had!  Dr. Zeman scoped my knee  Nov 2, 2011 and removed a 2 cm cyst and cleaned up the meniscus. I can't tell you how happy I am with not only Dr. Zeman but also his entire staff. I feel like I'm in really good hands and I know I am getting the best care possible. They actually really do care!
