5	I have only dealt with Michael, but he has been awesome.  If you didn't know better, you wouldn't think he is an accountant by his personality.  He is so very personable and savvy.  He not only does taxes, but he has helped me with business acquisitions and other complicated tax issues.  I can't say enough good about him.  I highly recommend him to anyone.
5	(Revised 2/26/10)- - - - - - - - - - - - -Early 2009:I bought a huge bank-owned house for a song, & didn't need 18 rooms for myself & my cat, so I went to work doing a major remodel on the place to carve out some apartments to rent out.  As the $1000s started to pour out, I set up some books to try to prepare for 2009 tax time & soon realized I was in over my head with the accounting (if not with the whole project!).  Of course I came here to Yelp to find help!I was impressed by the 5-Star review I read here by fellow Yelpie John S. for Michael Gallacher CPA, so I called over there.  Gallacher's nice assistant Brenda set up a convenient appointment for me, & I went in.Along with John S., I found Michael Gallacher to be both immediately likable, and completely knowledgeable.  In about 45 minutes, we got me on the right track to prepare for 2009 tax time.  I brought a list of questions, which were all cheerfully & clearly answered, & the whole session went just right.  My cost to straighten out the mess my books were in & get everything set up properly was a reasonable $125, & it brought me a lot of peace of mind!I left Gallacher CPA completely satisfied & confident that I was now keeping my records properly for tax time.  5-Stars!==================================================9/22/09:I dropped in to Gallacher's office unannounced with a different IRS issue.  Michael Gallacher was out, but I was greeted warmly by the receptionist & then seen right away by Michael Bosen, another partner in the firm.  Just as with Gallacher, I found Michael Bosen to be completely likeable & knowledgeable.  On top of that, he jumped right in to solve my problem, even though I had shown up without an appointment!  The fee for the new service I needed was reasonable, & it's 5-Stars for Michael Bosen too!==================================================January 2010:Once I had all my W-2s & so on, I brought them in, along with the books & receipts for 2009 that Michael Gallacher had me keeping, & piled them on his desk!  My complicated situation called for THREE Federal & TWO state tax returns to be filed, with all kinds of extra forms & so on.  I don't think I would have gotten it anywhere near right trying to do all this myself.  We talked for a few minutes, Michael cheerfully took on the task, & everything was ready to go in just a week or so.  They were able to able to electronically file most everything too, & now, just a couple of weeks later, I have received my tax refunds!  I can't overstate how happy I am using Michael Gallacher & this firm.
5	Ok, so as seen below, I came here to have my 2008 & 2009 taxes done, & the results were tops.  This time it was for my 2010 return.  I sat with Michael Gallacher for a half an hour to catch him up on my year's doings, & then left him with the stack of paperwork.That was about a week ago.  Today, I went & picked up my copy of the tax return that they are submitting to the IRS electronically for me.  I went over it tonight, & I'm glad I didn't try to do it all myself!  Michael G. here & the rest of the staff are SO NICE, & SO PROFESSIONAL, & I'm confident that they get me the best tax-saving results possible each year.  Thus, they continue to earn my highest recommendation!     :-))
5	We were living in Phoenix temporarily, and our 2010 taxes were a bit complicated.  I read the other Yelp reviews and decided to give it a shot, otherwise I would have randomly chosen an accountant based on location.   I was very happy with Mr. Gallacher.  He was very nice and personable.  He was not rushed, and made me feel very comfortable.  I'm a young woman, and sometimes people can make you feel intimidated.  But not Mr. Gallacher!  We've since moved from Arizona, but I think I will have him do our 2011 taxes as well!  Its not easy finding an accountant that you really like!
5	Another year, another great experience with Michael Gallacher & Co. doing my taxes!  This is my fourth time having them prepare them, plus seeing them for some IRS related services in between times, & they always meet my high expectations.Lovely people, top quality service!!     :-))6/29/12 note:  Today, this business relocated across the street to 1830 S Alma School Rd. #116.
5	I've recently moved to Phoenix and was looking for a good accountant. After reading the other yelp reviews I decided to make an appointment with Michael Gallacher. I am so glad I did, he was extremely knowledgeable and helpful and I feel a great deal of relief and comfort knowing he will be handling my taxes for my business and personal needs.
5	Tax time comes like clockwork, doesn't it?  Thankfully I have Mike Gallacher & Co. tackling the event for me, and it's now the beginning of my SIXTH TAX YEAR with them since first coming in after reading John S.'s rave Review right here on Yelp!The service I have received here all this time has always been absolutely 5-Stars both for the regular tax filings and my occasional call with a question.  They're friendly, they make everything concerning my taxes easy to understand, & they get everything right for the IRS!There's another nice touch here this year, too.  They have moved their office to this address from their former location on the second floor across the street and now you can drive right up to door, making it fun to pay your taxes!  ...Ok, almost.     :-))
5	Many reviews suggested this firm is the tops and I needed professional advice with my tax return for a specific item of business. They delivered hands down at a reasonable rate of return for both parties.  However the skeptic in me with something that I am not familiar with leaves me wondering and I suppose time will tell if the IRS comes knocking on my mailbox; hope not! The firm seemed very confident!!
5	Wow, I'm now into my SEVENTH TAX YEAR of using Michael Gallacher & Co. to do my taxes since I discovered them right here on Yelp and read the glowing review by John S.  All this time their service to me has been absolutely 5 Stars too!  My filings are complicated (to me, anyway) but these super nice folks answer any questions I have along the way through the year, followed by properly and quickly doing my IRS and State of Arizona submissions each time they come due.I have dealt mostly with Michael Gallacher but once when I had some mid-year business with the IRS MIke Bosen here helped me take care of that and he was great to work with too!Now if they would just have a bowl of free chocolates sitting out in the office...Wow, what's that over there?     :-))
