Lights out in a bathroom...fixed within 24 hoursGlass in the parking lot...cleaned up by days end.A/C issues...tended to in the same day.Even when I forget to send my rent check on time...they are happy to remind me with a kind email or phone call....  I've rented space before in town...  Clayton is top notch...  I recommend this team....
5	I have leased from Clayton Companies for over 5 years now. They have been very fair to us. They were willing to work with us through some tough years.We negociated our renewal recently.  They were very accommodating with some important improvements we needed. The improvements were completed in a timely manner. They also made a A/C duct work change that we requested later. Steve is always on the ball (I love the new repair ticket system) and Ken is terrific as their maintenance manager. We have had just a few repairs needed over the years, they have always been very responsive.I would recommend them to my best friends.
5	We've been renting an apartment from these guys for a year now and they've been awesome. Very responsive to maintenance issues and Steve is just a plain nice guy. What more could you want?
