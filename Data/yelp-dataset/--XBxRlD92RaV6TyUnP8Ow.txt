5	Yo, their store is awesome!  That dude, Richard, is da bomb! He hooked it up hardcore, mos def!
1	This is the last sprint store I will ever go to even if I have to drive out of my way to go somewhere else. The people there are very unprofessional and don't know what their doing. I walked in just to pay a bill and I have all of workers there just looking around talking not wanting to help even tho there's a lot of people here. It took them a while just to let me know there was a machine in the back where I can pay my bill. I went over to pay it and it wouldn't accept my money so I went back in line for some help and I have the guy a 20 and I didn't get any change back he just added it to the account without asking me. Probably because he was too busy making jokes with his buddy. Won't be coming back here!
5	Jaryd is plain and simple - AWESOME!!!  Screen on my S3...replaced.  Screen cover - replaced.  Speaker - replaced.  Helped me pick out a case so if I drop my phone, it wont shatter again.  This Sprint repair store is honestly about 15 miles out of the way, but if I ever need any work done on my phone again...I'm coming to this store to have Jaryd work on it.
4	Went in to upgrade to the Iphone 6, everyone was very nice even though we went in almost at closing time.  They have always provided great customer service, just wish the actual telophone service would improve.
