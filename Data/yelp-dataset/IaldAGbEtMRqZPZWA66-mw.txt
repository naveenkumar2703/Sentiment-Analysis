5	Brings back so many childhood memories! Pizza Hut should really build more of these, because who doesn't love a buffet of every kind of Pizza Hut pizza??!!
4	Well, well, well... Pizza Hut. So my bf and I went around looking for a PH buffet. We went to one in BF Egypt to no avail and asked them... of course they didnt know so we took a chance and called this little gem. SUCCESS!5.99 Lunch buffet, YES PLEASE! I used to live in Colorado and had one right by the house; cheapest and best pizza buffet imo. Of course as soon as they bring out new pizzas the people flock to it like vultures on a dead cow. But I love that they have cinna stix. The server was Meh, but the little beaner one we had the next time was suave. I'm a beaner fyi so I could say that... lol. She was awesome, the first one asked how old my 5yr old was and said she would have to charge him full price and I was like wtf?! He ate 1 slice of pizza!! (my son hardly eats, hes a skinny mini!!) but this next one didnt ask and didnt charge! My kinda woman!Anyway, pizza here is good... salad is ok, and the service is meh if you get the good ONE. Also, seems like they always only have 1 waitress there; so I always tip a little better... unless she tries to charge me full price for the mini!
