2	BARGAINS BARGAINS BARGAINS.Yes, Lookin' Trendy is as funky as your mum when she uses text speak like "g2g", trying to be down with the kids.Selling knock-off designer rip offs, it's very affordable and geared towards people trying to save a bit of cash. Nothing wrong with that in these troubled times, but it's not really my thing. T shirts covered in catchy slogans and metallic colours are loved by some people, but not for me.As Stephanie said, it's like the kind of gear that turns up in markets and stuff. Maybe you'll like it if you're looking for a more affordable alternative to labels such as Ed Hardy, but it's not really what I go for.
2	Oh they make it too easy for me. I want to be clever and witty but sometimes they do it for me. And I don't want to be mean either, someone has put a huge amount of entirely and hideously misguided effort into this place. My goodness, it's horrible.The window display contains a pink velour tracksuit. Who wears that?!?! Christina Aquaface circa 2000? I don't know, maybe some people go for this but all looked like cheap tat to me. Am I being too acerbic? It's called lookin' trendy for goodness sake. There's no more to be said.
3	Come on. give Lookin' Trendy a break.Firmly in the mid 90s both in terms of price and style, it always reminds me a bit of those awful Sweater Shop jumpers everyone used to wear back then. It's frightening how hideous they are now.Anyway, I'm sure the owners are well aware of the irony in the shop's name, but it isn't aimed at young fashionistas. This part of EH6 is not where the young go-getters go to get things, but the part of town where knock-offs are much in demand, and no night out is complete without a pink limo blaring out The Pussycat Dolls.Not my scene, maybe not yours, but it does a job.
