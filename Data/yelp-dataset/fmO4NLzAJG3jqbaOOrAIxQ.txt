5	The UPS store was a very good experience. The lady behind the counter was really helpful in allowing me to select packing material, repackage my parcel, and pay the postage. I had to repackage the parcel in the store, and she was very patient and helpful, even helping get more packing peanuts for me to use. I will definitely go back again (hopefully better prepared next time)!
4	I had to ship back my broken cell phone, so everything was all ready to go with a prepaid label and everything. I was greeted as soon as I walked in, which is always nice to see. The staff was moving really fast, but were super efficient. I was in and out in a jiffy. They had some pretty cool pens there and I picked up one because I needed a replacement purse pen.  Come on in and use these guys for all of your shipping needs!
5	We have had a P.O. Box here for almost 4 years. The staff is amazing! Always so friendly and helpful!
5	My husband and I went to mail a couple of packages at the Post Office off of Priest Dr. Between Warner Rd. and Elliot. The girl at the pick up door was very rude  so we basically said, "Okay, thank you" and left. We drove to the UPS store on Ray and 48th St. They were awesome! They filled the box with popcorn and taped it shut for us, at no extra charge (The girl at the Post Office was going to charge us $4 for tape). At the UPS store, it even cost less to ship our packages. They were extremely helpful, friendly.  We will definitely drive the extra 5 minutes to have such good customer service.
