5	Found their ad on Craiglist when I was looking to get some work done on my jeep.  I called and was very quickly able to get an over the phone estimate on parts and labor for the work requested.  They also gave me different option for pricing on parts due to their expertise. I would highly recommend Raven Industries to all my friends or anyone that is looking to get some fabrication or drive train work done, even basic mechanic repairs.
4	I needed to get my Jeep re-geared  and I found them through a Jeep website and Craigslist ad. Rico took the time to go over everything that would be done and gave a fair price quote. As time went by I was waiting for a part to be delivered, they went the extra step to to reinstall my locking hubs. Very happy with the work and the price was fair. Good job!
