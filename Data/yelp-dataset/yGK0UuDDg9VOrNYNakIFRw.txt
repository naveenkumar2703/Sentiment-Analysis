5	Been to WISH twice since they opened, Great name...Whats your wish? Finally a great place for locals close to the strip but also just FAR enough away, cool vibe, great music and great off the strip prices with plenty of parking! Close to my home to go out for a drink or stop in for a drink and unwind on my way home!
5	Wish is definitely the best new spot for locals in Vegas!! I've been there twice now & recommend everyone checks it out local OR not! Awesome atmosphere, good music AND reasonable drink cost!! Not to mention no cover charge at the door! FOR ANYONE!! Also, bottle service is affordable @ Wish. (Talk to Jeff, he'll take care of you)  I will definitely be going back!
5	Wish is definitely the best new locals spot in Vegas.  If you are tired of Blue Martini, you have to check out Wish!  Everyone there is so friendly.  Jeff (the owner) does a great job of making everyone feel special.  Next time you're thinking of the perfect spot to hit in Vegas, be sure to check out Wish.
5	If you're looking for a good place without all of the hype and pretentiousness of a typical vegas lounge, this is the place to go.  Chill seats and cheap drinks, what more do you want?
5	Awesome space. Bartenders & staff were super nice! Excited to see the venue when I'm not so busy NERDY DANCING...

5	Thank you Wish for opening a fun spot for locals to go. Your staff is friendly and outgoing. I have been a guest twice and will definitely be back soon! It's really nice to have a place to go to have fun where you meet other locals. The decor in Wish is unique and the music is great.
5	I have been to many clubs and lounges, on the Strip and off, and Wish has become one of my new favorites. The interior design was great. You walk in and the bar right in front to get some drinks before making your way inside. As you walk up towards the DJ, you have lounging areas on the sides which leave plenty of dance space in the middle. Don't have to worry about people going crazy around your seats as they tend to migrate towards the center. As for their sound system and quality, Wish has one of the best I've heard out here. Loud enough to party, but not overbearing to be annoyed with through the night. Wish is a great spot for locals, but check it out even if your visiting, it won't disappoint.
5	Wow! first off let me say this place is beautiful! The interior is very plush, and on par with some of the mega-clubs on the strip. The prices are very reasonable (think i was paying around 5 bucks a drink). Its a very non-hassle environment, you walk right in and there are places to sit down WITHOUT getting bottle service, this is something vegas defiantly needed. GREAT JOB!
4	Wish has a Wednesday night brunch that starts at 3am.  I had never heard of the place but we ended up here with our LAX hosts one night and it was a lot of fun.  The location is on Las Vegas Blvd but farther south than the majority of the casinos so it's really more of a locals spot.  Wish has a nice atmosphere, decent music, and yummy mimosas!  Check it out for something different.  It's also open on the weekends.
4	I still kick myself for missing Nerdy Dancing II. After reading everyone's review of the event, I was hoping to see what I had missed. With the right themes, this is a fantastic venue. It is spacious and gorgeous. The dance floors are broken into two areas. The main one with the dj is a waste since the stage protrudes so far into the floor. With a band this would make more sense, but in this capacity it was ridiculous. I was unsure if the second one was meant for dancing or not until the manager made a comment about having a huge dance floor and we were dancing in the hallway.
1	So came down here on a Friday night to check out the local scene.  Well the NO COVER advertisement is a lie and no one was even here.
4	Cute nightclub off the strip with and friendly staff. I would definitely go and check it out again!
5	Great night life ..music and  atmosphere are off the hook! this is why its Vegas baby!
