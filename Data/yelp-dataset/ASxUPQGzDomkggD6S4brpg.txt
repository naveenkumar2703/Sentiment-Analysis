4	I would bring a date here!The food is Cajun style with that New Orleans motif for decor.  The service was on point (good), and seating was more than adequate!  We asked for beads to darn on ourselves ---- and they brought us some!  The food is spicy as is Cajun style and the selections are terrific.  They serve alcohol and other libations...The location is a bit outside of Phoenix Proper, but if you are looking for that Cajun effect---This is a good place to start.  As a bonus, they gave us a gift card for $5 off our next visit...This was a nice evening to say the least...I recommend it.Four stars: One for decor, one for how the food tasted!  One for service, and one for price (reasonable).
1	Yuck!  Maybe I just don't like cajun food and fish though?!
5	I've been here about three times and it is on my places to go list for when I visit Chandler.  The first time I decided I should get the Redfish Plate because I figured it oughta be good since they are named after it.  It was not a disappointment, in fact was one of the best fish dinners I ever remember having.    I don't remember what I got the other times but know I enjoyed it.  I like the decor and if I remember right, they gave me some Mardi Gras necklaces I still have.  I will definitely go back next trip there.
