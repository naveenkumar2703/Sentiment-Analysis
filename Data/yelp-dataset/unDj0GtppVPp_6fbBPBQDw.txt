5	I have been going to Cuddlers for over a year now. I can't express how friendly, kind and professional the staff here are. I have a little 17 lb shih tzu mix, Panda who they take such amazing care of. Panda had a little rash under his tail and they went the extra mile by putting corn starch on it. They also have terrific advice/tips for pet care and they always have treats for the pups at the ready. I will never take Panda anywhere else as long as Cuddlers is around.
3	I have taken my Yorkie Trixie to Cuddlers several times now.  I have been happy with the job they do.  The location is convenient but making an appt is difficult for me at times because they are very strict on drop off/pickup times.  Other places I have been have been more flexible, let you drop you dog off a little early, etc.  They are a small shop so I understand they can't just have dogs there all day.  I have had the time they told me she would be ready be wrong also (both done early and late).  So you pretty much have to be close by waiting for them to call.  Don't be late.  They don't like that. Overall, they do a good job and have great prices.  Just make sure you don't have anything else to do.
5	This is a great place to take your dogs.  The owner is the consumate dog lover and makes such a fuss over the dogs - it makes you feel great leaving your pet.  They are cageless and they are a great place to bring animals that have anxiety.  Great energy and our dog actually enjoys going there. The receptionist remembers your name and cares a great deal about the animals they see.  I moved further away and I think it is worth the drive for such great service.
5	We love Cuddlers!!! My husband and I take our three little guys here. Trudy and Sue are the nicest sweetest people. We know they love our babies and will take care if them while they are there. This is the only place we will take our pups. 5+ stars for Cuddlers!
