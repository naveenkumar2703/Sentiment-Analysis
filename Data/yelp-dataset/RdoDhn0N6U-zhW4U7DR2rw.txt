4	I am used to Smoke Shops hassling me into buying something that I am not looking for -- I am pleased to say that was not my experience here. The owner (I am assuming here) was kind and took me to exactly what I was looking for. His only questions were to further clarify exactly what I needed.For a point of reference it is on the east side of the street near Mint Thai. The place itself was clean, well lit and the products were neatly organized. I will be back.
5	Terrific shop!  Clean and neat as could be, friendly owner, and good prices.  All smoke shops should be this good.
5	This place is hard to see from street, however once inside the store, you are in heaven.  If you are looking for any kind of smoking items, please go and visit this shop.  Sales person knows his stuff and truly does not push items on you that you don't need.
