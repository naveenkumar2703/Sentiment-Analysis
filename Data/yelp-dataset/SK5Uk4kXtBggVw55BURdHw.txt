5	Jiffy Lube is known for having fast service, but this is the fastest Jiffy Lube I've been to. I went in on the weekend expecting a lot of people, but there was just one other car they were working on. I asked the guys there if they took the coupon I had, and they did. After they were done I asked if they knew where I could get a tire air cap thing because I crushed one of my old ones. The guy walks back into the garage area and asks me how many I want. I said one, and he handed me one. =) SWEET! I told him that I loved Jiffy Lube, and he said Jiffy Lube loves me too. Aww.

They will also try to sell you extra crappy services you don't need (wait, everyone does this). However, they quoted me $70 (I knew I needed some extra crappy service), charged me $120, and then "did me a favor" by taking 20 bucks off. $100 for an oil change and changing light bulbs. That's very effed of you, jiffy lube. I should have given you the new bulbs back and gone to an auto parts store to buy my own d*mn bulbs. ARGH.
1	Tried to get my oil change and tires rotated on my truck here today, but I decided against it because apparently one of their jacks is broken. That means that they only have one jack, which is being used all the time, which means that its probably about to break as well.  It's definitely not going to be my truck that falls to the ground when this jack breaks.  I also went to another Jiffy Lube near by on Broadway and Rural, same story.   If Jiffy Lubes can't keep their tools updated and fixed, how can their mechanics be performing up to par on my beloved 'Yota?  Eek! Methinks NOT.
