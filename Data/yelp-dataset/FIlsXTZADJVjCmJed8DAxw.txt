1	If I could give this dentist no stars I would. She has no idea how to listen to patients. She is the worst dentist I've ever seen.
1	Worst experience ever. Procedure was 400% more than quoted. On top of that, more procedures were added that were never discussed. Asked about it, was yelled at and told that the Dentist decided on the procedure of their own accord and chose not to inform me. When asked why, was told there was no time. Great job, small business, I appreciate going an hour out of my way to get yelled at by and angry Indian woman. Walked out before the procedure and will not ever consider going back. If you're on a budget, which is probably the case seeing as you're going to a strip mall dentist, I would consider a drunken dentist visit to Mexico before going to this place.
