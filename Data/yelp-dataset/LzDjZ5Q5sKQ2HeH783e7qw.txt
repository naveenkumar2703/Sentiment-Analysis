4	Service has always been great, but nothing really memorable. A couple of the rolls I got were made kind of sloppy and were falling apart before the plate even made it to the table. Not sure why as every time I've been here there's been no crowd so no need to rush. Staff is always nice and prices are great!
4	Here's the very definition of a fast food sushi place.  The location is small, the service is swift and the food is so-so.  I'm a chicken teriyaki man myself, but all I had to choose from was BBQ chicken (which is not quite the same thing), so I opted for the BBQ combo plate which features a little bit of everything.  It was good; no complaints here.  I went with a friend who ordered a couple of sushi rolls which she said tasted fine; she later commented it was "a step above the sushi they sell in grocery stores" and awarded it 3 stars.  I'd give it 4 just because the chicken/beef/short rib was decent, and the owners were nice.
4	I went here with my girlfriend on a Tuesday night. We were dining in with a restaurant.com coupon. There was no one else there when we arrived at 6 pm, but a few other people showed up as the meal went by. We selected a few different rolls, all were very well prepared and came out quickly. Some of the rolls were a little warm (when the should have contained cold fish), but otherwise very tasty. The ingredient quality cannot compete with some of the bigger name sushi places in Vegas, both in freshness and preparation. Otherwise this place (which is known online as M Sushi as well) was pretty good. I would definitely come here again.
