4	Today was my first time visiting K'Bella. I went to see Anita for a haircut. I have been following Anita around for about three years so it is safe to say that I am a big fan. She knows my hair better than I do. Anita gets five stars. The rest of the salon is also nice and if I go back for anything else I'll be better able to rate the spa services. The place it clean, well lit, well designed, comfortable, and when I called this morning to make an appointment someone was there to answer the phone on the first ring or two. That can be sort of a big deal. I'll be back in five weeks for another haircut. Maybe I'll try out another service too and offer another review.
4	My husband gets his hair cut by the same girl every time and he loves it. She does a great job, and is super friendly. Always such a clean place, and I love the shampoo I bought.
