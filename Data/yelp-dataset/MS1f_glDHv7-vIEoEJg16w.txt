4	Been looking for new rugs for my kitchen floor, and since I wanted something with a Little padding, it was hard finding something to fit my expectation. Then it hit me, try Anna's. At first, I walked the floor looking at the inventory and was surprised by the cost, it seems reasonable. For someone who likes to sew and often do sew my own curtains, I was impressed with the quality of the fabrics used. I found want I was looking for, and after reviewing the cost of new towels, will be back before year of year for new bathroom sets. This place is worth looking at for linens.
5	Great Service, some good deals. I loved shopping there. The attendants were so nice .
3	Bedsheets, comforters, pillows and blankets.  Here is a large selection of colors, styles, and quality.  If you are looking for a purple bathroom set, with everything to match, this is your place.Today, I came looking for a new king size bed pillow, feather, and some extra pillow cases.  There are at least 8 different styles of pillows to choose from.  I was happy with the standard hotel style.  I quickly found some extra cases and once again pleased with the cost.  You should check this place, there are some good bargains to find here.
4	Most women like shopping for shoes and clothes. However I am a fan of sheets, towels, and comforters. Yes, I have a large collection because I am always changing my theme. Somehow I was searching for the craft store and I came across Anna's Linens. They had a sale for 500 thread sheets so i had to buy several sets as well as a new downs-comforter since it is cold in vegas. I will be return after the holidays to buy more things for my new place.
