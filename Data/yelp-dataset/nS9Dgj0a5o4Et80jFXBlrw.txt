4	If this place was outside of the airport, it would not garner itself 4 stars due to the limited menu and the overpriced food.  However, it IS in an airport, and thus tends to outshine all the mediocrity that surrounds it.I was mostly just looking for lunch during a layover, and I wanted something other than Quizno's.  I did not have a martini, but they have many of those in addition to having a full bar.  I had iced tea, and I ordered the beef brisket sandwich (I initially wanted their bacon/avocado/chicken salad, but they were out of that).  Their menu is sparse, but the sandwich was pretty tasty and definitely satisfied my hunger.  The sandwich featured brisket with a delicious horseradish cream sauce (served on the side) in addition to au jus for getting your dip on!The waiter, Frank, is pretty cool and seems to be straight out of a 40's gangster movie in Brooklyn.  He hooked me up with my brisket, and I couldn't have asked for more!
4	So far so good. This was the only bar in the airport that wasnt mobbed with people. They have AC power at the 2 end booths. This is located in the B terminal, near gate B8 (the yelp pin is misleading). The biggest problem with this place is that they close at 3PM! :-(
