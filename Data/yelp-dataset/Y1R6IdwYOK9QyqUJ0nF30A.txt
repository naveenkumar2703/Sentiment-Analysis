4	Ha!  First review. Really?Blizz is IMNSHO the best place to have breakfast in MGM if you aren't one of those 'would rather eat massive amounts of crappy food from the trough' buffet types.  For ten bucks plus tax you can get either crepes or waffles (made to order) with all sorts of fruity, nutella-ey, or savory toppings.  And either a soda or a smoothie  (extra charge of course).They also have one of those make-your-own fro-yo bars with lots of flavors and toppings at 59c an oz.I had "The Congo" nutella + banana crepes and they were pretty good.  Not the best crepes I've had but decent compared to the crap at the food court and more interesting / less expensive than Studio Cafe. (Where all the breakfasts are about $15+)I also visited Blizz for dessert one night during my trip and got a piece of chocolate molten lava cake for $4.95.  It was pretty good too and they packaged it to go so I could have my chocolate orgy in private.I think they open at 8am during the week, which sadly wasn't early enough several days of my visit but it was the most satisfying breakfast I had during the week.
4	This place popped up a little over a week after my first visit to the MGM this year, and one evening after dinner I was craving something sweet so I came down to grab a crepe to take back to my room. The girl behind the counter was super helpful, and I decided on getting a nutella crepe with strawberries. These are certainly not cheap, my crepe ran me about $11, but at the time it was worth every penny :)
4	When I noticed Blizz as I was strolling through the Studio Walk at MGM, I figured it would be just like any other Frozen Yogurt place.  Thankfully, Blizz was actually  much better than I thought it would be.The morning after we noticed it, we stopped for Breakfast. We got two Cafe Mocha's, a Ham & Cheese Crepe and a Congo Crepe.  The Ham & Cheese had plenty of both and the bite I stole tasted very good. The Congo had Bananas and Nutella with lots of Whipped Cream. It was like having dessert for breakfast, which is a good thing on vacation! The Coffees were just OK.Next time I visit, I'll try the Yogurt and maybe even a drink from their Bar!  You order at a Counter so it is wheelchair accessible and the staff will provide assistance if needed.
1	:( I wanted yogurt, and since this place was located in the MGM Grand hotel, I decided to give it a try. I walked down here in the morning for breakfast, and it wasn't crowded at all. I did see crepes being made but I went straight for the froyo. I grabbed a cup and proceeded to the original tart. It was runny.. ugh. I then gave the other flavors a try, but they were ALL runny as well. So sad. I decided to just go pay for the mushy yogurt already in my cup. I put some toppings on, then headed out. The yogurt tasted really weird, and unlike tart AT ALL. It was expensive, and for what I had paid for, I wasn't happy at all. If the yogurt was actually good, I wouldn't have mind.. I should've just gotten a crepe or something!
4	This is a great idea. The prices were reasonable, the amount of toppings was awesome and the froyo was pretty good.
3	There is more to Blizz than $.59/oz froyo! Crepes and waffles are also to be found here. Good evening snack if you don't want to hit up a restaurant but you're craving something after, let's say, Cirque du Soleil. For $10, you get any number of crepe or Belgian waffle options. An extra buck gives you savory breakfast choices that are definitely more on the health-conscious side. Lots of fruit, toppings, and sauce options. I like the Versaille - strawberries and bananas with chocolate drizzle (truth be told, they kind of over-do it on the drizzle). I asked for no whipped cream and just a little powdered sugar and got.....tons of powdered sugar and lots of whipped cream. Alas. The crepe - while not the finest I've ever had in my life - was nice and filling. The lines get crazy here around lunch time so if you want to experience it, better to go mid-morning or afternoon (or late-night!). Food is prepared pretty swiftly.
1	This review is purely for the frozen yogurt.  This is my first 1-star review.I really feel bad for the people who gave this place 4+ stars for their yogurt because that means they don't know what good froyo tastes like!!  It breaks my heart :(If you're from southern California where froyo shops are plentiful, steer clear of this place.  The yogurt has an odd flavor.  The fruit wasn't ripe either.My friends and I had a $50 room credit to use that night since we were leaving the next morning so we thought we'd shave some of it off by getting a little froyo and using the rest for drinks or food later.Well a little froyo (i.e. 3 yogurts) cost us a whopping $25.91.  Are you shitting me?  Even the highest-priced yogurt shops like Pinkberry and Red Mango will cost you an average of $5 a pop.  So yes, close to $9 per really-shitty-tasting yogurt is an outrage.The kicker?  Even though we confirmed with them that they accepted room credit, they weren't able to pull it up on the system which meant we had to pay for said yogurt.Let me tell you right now that when we reached the front desk, I raised an uproar until the woman would change our room credit to $75 since it was their fault that we were in this mess in the first place.  Though, it's Blizz's fault for having such crappy yogurt.I have yet to try any of their other items.  After my experience with their yogurt, I don't want to.
3	-Review for froyo only-This was my first froyo stop while on a girls trip to Vegas.  It was pretty standard- self-serve froyo with a few flavors and lots of toppings.  The flavors could stand a change to something more unique, but they did have a wide variety of toppings.  Price was decent, too.  Overall not a bad place for a quick foryo stop if you really need a fix, but with the many other options for froyo, ice cream and other treats in Vegas, you may want to look elsewhere.  The crepes looked good, but sadly no time to try them.
2	Meh.  I ordered a strawberry and banana with nutella crepe - the insides were good, but you can't really go wrong with anything nutella. At least the fruits were fresh too.   The crepe itself was totally off.  It was difficult to cut - very rubbery and the taste / texture was very chewy.  For the price, I would have to pass on this and go to one of the Jean-Phillipe crepe places.
4	I stayed at the MGM Grand while I was in Vegas for CES. I walked by Blizz several times and made it a point to stop in for a crepe before the week was over. On my last day there, I went to Blizz and decided on The Versailles -- a yummy crepe served with bananas, strawberries, chocolate drizzle and whipped cream. It was yummy and very filling. Definitely enough to share.
4	Decent service and awesome ice cream!
4	We paid 14$ for two small things of froyo. it was pretty insane, wouldn't do it again, but while in MGM it was a quick shuffle down to the food court! Why not!? We were on vacation and I guess its okay to splurge sometimes... but It was a great way to satisfy the craving for sweets - hit the spot!
3	Not worth going out if your way for, but if it is in your hotel worth a stop if you are hungry! We went twice during our stay for the crepes. The best by far was the one with nutella and banana. The fruit ones were a little too sweet.

3	Good food it is a bit pricey you should expect that in a Vegas Casino.  The Belgian waffle was very good with berry compote.  Looking for something fast that is open in the mornings and is not in the food court you should check them out.
5	Very good service very clean great shake they have breakfast crapes that look amazing and omelets look yummy.  price was good
4	A lifesaver during my last Vegas trip. My first mistake: assuming everything there would be fattening and unhealthy like every other crepe place. But wait! They have fresh cleansing juices. Oh my! I've never been into juicing but this place changed my mind for sure. Have you ever become FITTER during a Vegas trip?!? Well, it happened to me. I was very pleased with the surprising results. How did it happen?All hail the **Detoxifyer**! Densely packed with kale, celery, apple, beet, ginger, and lemon, the juice is delicious compared to many of the healthy concoctions out there. Of course it can't compare to a sugary juice, but it does soooo much more.I had arrived in Vegas knowing I would be attending a pool party at Wet Republic after 4 days of eating terribly. There were no vegetables or good salad options anywhere around. So I had a feeling I'd gain weight by the time I had to don a bikini. But hey! Detoxifyer to the rescue! One juice once a day for 3 days was enough to do the trick. On the 4th day I put on my swimsuit and was actually impressed. I couldn't believe it.If you need something more substantial to eat (I did), try **The Fitness** crepe and add Alfredo chicken to the mushroom spinachy mozzarella goodness. I split one of these with with my friend and also had the Detoxifyer.The only thing I'd change about this place is the system to indicate when orders are ready. They have to shout the order number out and then people come up and take items without having to show a receipt. Maybe a more automated system that shows a number and patrons have to show proof of purchase. My order was stolen twice! Granted the MGM Grand was overrun by about 15,000 people from my company's convention. But still, such a system would help even on a daily basis.Overall I love Blizz for introducing healthy juice options to me. Thank you to the clerks for the recommendation! And special thanks to the Detoxifyer! You've really opened my eyes.DATE TIP: The Detoxifyer will definitely get you ready for your next hot Vegas date. TIP: [[[ T.M.I. Alert ]]] Remember that what you put in must also come out. You may have to use the restroom slightly more often than before, and things may look the same color as when you consumed them. The Detoxifyer is a vivid pomegranate color. Haha, I told you it was TMI. You've been warned!
1	Ok snack time in Vegas. One thing to say about MGM is they do have a nice sized food court. If you are looking for a cheap meal or a snack then they have plenty of places for that. I saw that this place had Nutella crepes. That is all I needed to see Nutella crepes. I was sold. I make a mean Nutella crepe so I was curious to see how there's was. The verdict: ok. Mine is much better and I am not saying because it is mine. I am saying that because it is true. If there's was better I would gladly admit it and improve mine based on there's but can't do it. The actual crepe itself tasted pretty plain. There was no real flavor to it at all.  It was also rubbery in consistency and and the plastic knife they gave me to cut it was not doing it. I practically had to take it apart with my hands! A nice fluffy crepe you can cut through easily.  If I would have known how plain I would have opted for the whipped cream on it just have to a little extra flavor because they did not put much Nutella on it. Most bites I got a mouthful of crepe and that's it.  It also set me back $11.95 and even for Vegas I thought that was steep!  The Nutella was good, lol. The crepe itself was a decent size I guess but regardless it was still overpriced.The customer service was not really there either. I mean they rang me up and gave me a pager for when my order was ready and that is it. No greeting or smiles or anything really welcoming. I am not asking for my butt to be kissed but at least act like you want to serve your customers. It was a "I don't want you here" kind of vibe. It also took a while to get my crepe. The wait was a little excessive.  Also when I ordered they asked if it was to go and I said that it was but when I got it the had prepared it for me to eat it there. When I asked for a to go box I guess that was a problem because I got an evil look. She rolled her eyes and got me the box.  Overall if I were to get a snack here again I would opt for the frozen yogurt and avoid the crepes. But after seeing  some of the other reviews I may just avoid the place all together.   Not only are they overpriced but the quality does not match up and if it did the price would not be an issue.
2	Waited in a long line for a tropical rush smoothie with mango, pineapple, banana juice and yogurt. After 10 minutes-ish got my drink. First sip had plastic wrapper bits in it. Thought it was a one time thing. Nope. Got another bit of plastic wrap or something. Brought it back and it looked a bit different with seeds in it. I was right!! I ended up with a different drink: strawberry tango. Ugh. Forget going back!! I might get spit in it. :/ although the drink was refreshing the incidents set this review back a few stars.
2	This place is in the MGM hotel, so it's very convenient. But like all things in Vegas, it's too pricey. $20 for two people is too much.There were four flavors that were empty, so I had to choose a different one than what I wanted. And there wasn't any sample cups! I ended up getting a cookies and cream with some chocolate. I tasted it from my cup and it was bland. Just no flavor at all. So I over compensated with toppings, which were standard. Nothing special. Meh. I should have just had more booze instead of this place.
