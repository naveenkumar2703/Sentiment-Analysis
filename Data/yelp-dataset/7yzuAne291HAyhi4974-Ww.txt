4	We go to this PetSmart on a regular basis... probably a few times a month for all of our dog and fish necessities. The employees are always very helpful - one of the employees even stopped to help me pick out a properly sized "Gentle Leader" and showed me how to put it on my dog. I love that this PetSmart does adoptions with the local rescues on Saturdays. Stop by if you want to see some cute dogs and cats :)
3	I got my bearded dragon, Loki (pictures at lokibd.blogspot.com) from this Petsmart. She is happy, healthy, and growing like a weed, so I appreciate that they buy healthy animals and do seem to take good care of them. However, a few times I have gone in there I have gotten bad advice from a few employees. For example, feeding a baby dragon mealworms is generally a bad idea as they cannot process mealworms' hard shells. One employee told me they feed their babies mealworms all the time, and tried to get me to buy some rather than crickets.Do your own research before trusting a pet store employee; they care for dozens of animals every day, all with their unique care requirements, and don't have the time or resources to devote to making sure your particular breed of reptile/amphibian is getting the best care.The store is bright and clean, and when they have dog adoptions they are in a large but fairly out-of-the-way spot from the rest of the store, so you aren't tripping over cages as you shop. Their stock of reptile accessories is pretty good.
