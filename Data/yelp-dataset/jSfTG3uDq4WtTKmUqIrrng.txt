5	This is a coffee roaster who provides beans to local coffee shops.  It is run by the affable Randall Denton, who used to be a barista and manager at the legendary Willow House.Xanadu supplies a few local joints, like Sapna Cafe, and the coffee is delicious, and the rates are reasonable.  They also offer bags for the typical home coffee addict, and a subscription service.I don't really know much about the bean process, so I'm going to stop myself here.  If you are a restauranteur looking for locally-roasted beans, or a coffee fiend who wants to support your local roaster, look this place up.
5	This is some amazing coffee.
5	This review is about the Espresso Blend and the service - I have not tried any other blends as I drink mainly straight espresso so I'm very picky with the beans.Randy is a great guy. I buy a lb every week or two depending on my work travel schedule. I explained I like very fresh beans and he has been very accommodating. I call, ask when he is going to roast next and try to make sure I pick it up in a day or two after. Now the beans...Very good blend. It is a light City Roast which, in my coffee geek-dom over the last 12 years, has shown that I prefer this style espresso roast.The flavors are good with med complexity and it works well with milk drinks too... the milk does not kill the complexity.It is an all-around good blend for both straight shots and milk drinks and I have made this my daily beans :)
