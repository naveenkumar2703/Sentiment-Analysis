4	Went here early on Sunday. Not busy at all. I also came here because they accept cards inside and the one on Pecos and desert inn doesn't. Weird right! Yeah any ways the play equipment is kinda boring but new and clean so always a plus!Also the food was cheaper at this one. Hmmmm!
3	It's always about the drive thru for me. How fast I can get in and how fast I can get out.This location I have no gripes about. The employees are friendly and fast and do a great job.I haven't been inside so I can not attest to the cleanliness of the place but you can't go wrong with the drive thru here.
2	Uh, Hello.. I ordered the medium fries! Pretty simple drive through order, but really? Just fill the container, not half full but full! Sheesh...
2	The wifi here is horrible it's super slow.  And during my visit the soda was flat perhaps and hopefully this is not always the case. But that wifi sucks the only good thing is its freeBut dam I pay some money to use it just for better speed!
