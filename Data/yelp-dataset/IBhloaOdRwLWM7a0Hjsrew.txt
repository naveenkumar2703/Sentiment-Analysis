4	Ok, so I don't wear a wig, nor have ever purchased extensions.. but if I did, this is where I would go. This place is THE source for Indian hair, Bohyme hair and Pre-Tipped and Clip-In hair extensions (as boasts their website). I've walked around this store several times and tried their wigs on, so much fun! .. The hair they use is Indian hair donated at Hindu temples in India. So it is the real deal, and you can curl and color it too. The hair is a bit pricey ($100 for extensions, $200+ for wigs), but If you're looking to change your looks or have the misfortune of losing your hair check out Sunny's.
5	WHOOP WHOOP !! My new go to spot for extensions!Lots of variety...in both types of extensions and wigs as well. Decent price for the quality of the product. Looking for a new spot to add new styles to your collection or just looking to maybe switch up your look a lil bit and have fun with the different colors ..check this place out!p.s it was my first time buying extensions and the girl was very helpful in making sure i got the perfect match for me.
