1	My wife went here with friends and their customer serviced ruined their dinnerThey were first seated by a lady, who wouldn't come back for 10 mins to take an order. The food was served by different man. Then my wife realized that soup that she didn't order came on the table . She told the man that she didn't order the soup. but the man said it comes with order. So she thought that maybe dinner is served with soup. so she ate it. When she is done, another lady who handles bill realized they made a mistake. Then she said to my wife that the soup was mistakely ordered by them but since she ate it, she had to pay for it. My wife explained the situation to the casher a couple times and had some arguments. At the end, she ended up taking it off the charge but still her last word was "you don't want to pay for it? but but you ate it !"I have never heard of this ridiculous story happening in any restaurant. Who caused the error and who's blaming who, trying to charge for their error?  They were very rude. I can't comment on their food but they should get negative service rating.
