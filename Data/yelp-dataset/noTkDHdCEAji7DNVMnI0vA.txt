5	Dr. Nassar is really awesome
5	From my experience going to the dentist has always been very frightening .i have been going since I was a child , as I grew so did my fear.Dr James came highly recommended. By two coworkers. I met dr James and his staff in October 2012 .from the very first visit he and his staff attended to all my needs and fears. Every visit  has been so wonderful I have never been so relaxed during  my visits. The professional  patient staff are so amazing and attentive. , I have never been happier, also the quality of work is amazing , my teeth look and feel amazing.  The staff is professional and the office immaculate ! Thank you dr James and staff for  taking time with me during my visits  to make me feel comfortable, and relaxed!  Also giving me a great smile :)
5	Best dentist hands down!!!! Every single one of their staff members is sweet, kind, efficient, and great!!! I have been going here for over 12 years and when the military moved me out of state I still plan my trips around my cleanings! They are terrific all around!!! Do NOT waste your time anywhere else!
