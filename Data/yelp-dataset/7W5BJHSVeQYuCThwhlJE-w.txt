4	Just recently had brake service, and  a oil change done at this shop the people seem friendly, and the prices were average we did get a discount on the brake and oil service which help across the total bill.  If you are looking for a shop you might to try this place. Compare to the other repairs shops in the area these guys are better than those others shops and belive me I have done business with them all and you can read my reviews on them.

5	Fast and friendly, gave me great service at a fair price. Offered online coupons if I needed them.
2	I took my 2006 Chevy Cobalt in for an oil change this morning (I scheduled an appointment over the phone yesterday). The guy at the desk was friendly and after about 10 minutes, one of the mechanics started working on my car. My car has around 122,000 miles so I was expecting them to tell me I needed SOMETHING fixed - turns out, one of my front brake pads and rotors needs replaced. I asked for a written estimate and they gave me one, no problem. When I asked if my car would be safe to drive for a week or two, the guy didn't give me a definite answer - he just said I'd hear squealing. I wasn't expecting him to tell me EXACTLY how many miles my brake pad will last but some idea would have been nice. I went in for a regular oil change and that's exactly what I got. For $26.95 (that's WITH a coupon), I hoped they would check the fluids or at least my tire pressure but no. Overall, it's a nice enough shop considering it's in San Tan Valley but I'm used to getting a bit more with an almost $30 oil change, that's all.
