4	It's definitely something fun to do and worth experiencing.The ride itself takes about 15 minutes. The balloon goes up approximately to the hight of the nearby Mandalay Bay casino building. I hoped it'd go higher than that. The view is spectacular notwithstanding. It's quite windy up there, so dress appropriately.
4	A nice addition to the choices available on the Strip. I imagine this could be a good alternative for families who have limited options here in Vegas.The ride lasts approx. 15 minutes and is pretty smooth. The balloon is tethered, but it's at the south end of the Strip, so you get to see the entire Strip. It wasn't nearly as scary as I had imagined, despite a fear of heights.It's not something I would pay $25 for, but I got a free certificate by donating blood. Definitely worth a pint of blood.
3	bought tix online so it was $25+tax. not really a line when we got there so we were on the balloon w/in 10 min. since the balloon was tethered and didnt relly go that high, it seemed more like a ride that looks like a hot air balloon. I was hoping to be more in like a basket and for the balloon to actually move around and go higher, but I assume that would be way more expensive.
