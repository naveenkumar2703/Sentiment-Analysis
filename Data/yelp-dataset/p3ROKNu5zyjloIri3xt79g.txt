2	I just don't like Baja any more. When I was in high school we would come all the time. I got the chicken burrito and it was just OK. Way more tortilla than filling. It came with chips and I got a large refillable cup but they only have the nasty golden peak cartridge tea. Why can't people stick to good ole fresh brewed..The staff was super nice both when they took my order and I let them know they were out of ice..for 10$ my meal was just ok..
4	Food was good, service was fast, and salsa was spicy. Overall it was a good experience and I would return if in the area
4	Food is delicious! Service is great... my salad was delicious.  There new surf and turf is great. The staff is always very nice to me is a great place to grab on the go and it fresh!
