1	This place has got to have THE.  WORST.  PIZZA. EVER.  It was tissue paper thin and absolutely dripping with grease from the pepperoni.  I was already at Santa Fe Casino so thought I'd give them a try.  I will be speaking to the Manager of the casino to ask him if he as actually tried this place as all the other restaurants are very good in Santa Fe.  Don't try Villa Pizza....save yourself!
1	Avoid this plaw at all costs.  The pizza is like cardboard covered in string cheese it was reheated to serve and burnt... and the service is horrible.  Who walks away right in the middle of taking an order to answer a phone call?!?  And then the guy that came out of the back gave me attitude because I he barely spoke English and couldn't understand me when I was forced to repeat my order.  GET YOUR STORE IN CHECK MANAGEMENT!
5	Normally, I don't rate food court spots. It's food court pizza, pasta and salad. So don't expect more than that. What made Villa pizza stand out was the exceptional service provided. 5 stars for the young man who went out of his way to make my family and I feel important. :)
