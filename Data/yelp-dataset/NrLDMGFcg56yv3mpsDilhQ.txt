1	This McDonald's is really bad. They don't even open the play place until almost 11 am even though there are like 10 kids waiting. The manager said she doesn't know when they open. They rang up my order wrong and took forever to figure it out. The dining areas are dirty. What the heck is wrong with this place?!
1	Came in here late after the bar ordered some breakfast and some hamburgers because you can get them both at this location it took us 45 minute wait before we got it it was crazy ridiculous. Called the corporate office they said they would take care of the problem Scott in a little bit better but not hundred percent.
1	Okay for some reason they cannot get a decent person in the drive-through here that speaks it understands English I got so mad we had to leave because I didn't understand what she was saying this is America I speak English here this is what you need to be speaking if you're working for the public speak and understand English only. So if you don't speak or understand Spanish then I would avoid this drive-through at all cost, I believe it's very important and working with public.
1	This place is bad, even for a McDonald's
1	I cannot believe how SLOW SLOW SLOW the DT is here. How does corporate not get involved? There DT wait times must be HORRIBLE!
