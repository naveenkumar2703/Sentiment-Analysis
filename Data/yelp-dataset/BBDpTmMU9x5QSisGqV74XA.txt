5	$5 shoe shine.
5	Francis always does a great job.
5	Go see Francis in the Golden Nugget's men's restroom located near the 24 carat club. (I'm being specific because most of the knuckle heads in that place don't have a freaking clue when you ask where to find the shoe shine guy). With over 30 yrs experience, he's a great individual who takes immense pride in his work. He only charges a few bucks for dress shoes, but he did such a wonderful job, I tipped him well. I recommend you do the same. He'll reward you with the biggest smile and gratitude you'll ever get in Las Vegas.*If you've ever got your shoes shined @ Nordstroms you can really appreciate the work that this man does! I only make it out to Vegas a few times a year, but I wait to get my shoes shined by Francis rather than wasting my time and money going anywhere else!*
5	I went to see Francis yesterday at the Golden Nugget. My shoes were in such bad shape that I thought I was going to need a new pair. However, within 10 minutes, he cleaned them up to look like they were new.
5	Found Francis the shoe guy via Yelp. Took him a pair of tan leather shoes (3 years old, resoled 3 times). I thought they were only good for the trash, but Francis gave them a new lease of life. They now look immaculate. He also cleaned a pair of my girlfriend's black boots which should keep her happy.  For 5 minutes, at least.
