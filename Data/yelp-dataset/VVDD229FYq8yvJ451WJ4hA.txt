This newly open location with bright colored walls with modern decor is located in central Phoenix. The owner who is from CA has many years of experience and decided to branch off to share her classy styles in her own shop. There are other hair stylist as well. You need a relaxer, protein treatment, cut, color, braids, weave done right and much more ask for Kenya the shop owner. Ladies I have natural hair that grows. Yep, thanks to my hair stylist who knows what she is doing. Kenya uses Design Essentials which is also sold at her shop. The salon products do well with my hair. I recently went to Florida to play on the beach. She wiped me up with a treatment that left my natural hair silky straight and no humidified frizz. Her flexible schedule and Monday-Saturdays hours allows me the time to work around my schedule. Call today to setup an appointment. Everyone is welcome as Kenya has experience will all hair types.
