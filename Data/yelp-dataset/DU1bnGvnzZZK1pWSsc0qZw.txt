4	You will leave refreshed and properly taken care of when you come to see the experts at this no nonsense nails spot. You can know that your hands and feet will be positively clean and made more healthy. I recommend that you wait for Sam to handle your pedicure if like me you are hard on your feet or have dry skin. You'll get the massage of a lifetime included with the price. A mani-pedi is about $35 ti start. If you have callouses or need additional pampering, it's still very reasonable .  This place offers waxing too if you want to shape your brows or remove evidence of testosterone !
5	Great service!!(written on 4/24/2012)
3	The ladies here were very friendly, and we laughed a lot which is always nice. They did not have a large selection of gel polish, which I was a little disappointed about. I got a manicure and pedicure, my pedicure came out very nice, my manicure came out just okay. I would definitely give them another try to see if maybe today was just an off day. The prices were very reasonable.  The salon is not as updated as others I have been to. Susan was very friendly however and that makes a big difference in my overall feeling about a salon.
5	Really great service and affordable pedicures from $22- $30
4	Great place, speedy and always a great pedi.Massage always rocks, get a sugar rub, leg massage and callus remover.. oh and French for $37.00...
5	My girlfriend has been coming here for years and she finally convinced me to get a pedicure. I usually do not like having other people touch my feet, but I have to say, they give the best massages here!
5	I love this salon! Sam is the best! I always leave feeling relaxed and beautiful. The prices are just right and everyone in there is so friendly. I can't wait to go back :)
