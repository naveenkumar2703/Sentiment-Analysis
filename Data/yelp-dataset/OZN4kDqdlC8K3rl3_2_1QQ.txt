4	My hubby knows one of the owners/instructors from before, so he decided to pay them a visit and see how they were doing. He just started doing BJJ, and my boys started along with him.They are so happy!!  They love it there, the atmosphere is very family-oriented, not oppressive at all, however very disciplined. They can't wait each day for school to be over so they can go train!Kids' classes are: From 5pm-5:55pm M, Th kids Kickboxing, TWF Kids BJJ.Go check it out!!
5	Excellent school that provides a wide variety of training levels from beginners to elite-level competition. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai kickboxing, kid's class, women's self-defense; there's something for everyone. The instructor's are well-trained and can teach individuals of all levels and body types.They're also affiliated with multiple-time champion Caio Terra BJJ. He comes out a few times a year to teach seminars which is a great opportunity to learn from a world-renowned practitioner. If you're looking for a fun, tough workout you need to check out Phoenix BJJ/MMA!
5	This place is great.  Kevin is a awesome instructor.  He is clear and teaches each technique in a variety of ways to make sure you have it down.  Each lesson is a good balance of technique and fitness.  You will learn a lot very quickly here and you will learn it well.  On top of all this the price is unbeatable.  You get unlimited classes here.  That means you can go twice a day for a total of 5 hours a day and still pay far less than other locations in the west valley.  AND with a 2 week free trial you can't loose.
