5	If you have never experienced the delectable heaven that is See's candy you are missing out.  Honestly, this place has been here for at least 70 million years and I think the brachiosaurus was just as big of a fan of the truffles as I am. I love the classic black and white checkered tiles and the adorable smocked emplyees. The brand has this quaint old timeyness that I really dig. Mary See is the grandmother I always wanted! I love that they ALWAYS give you free chocolate and have amazing customer service all around. It is so much fun to go and hand pick a few treats for me and the roomies. The quality and uniqueness of their offerings make it definitely worth the trip. If you love chocolate then you should be asking yourself why you haven't stopped in before now. I am eating a pumpkin pie truffle right now that is rockin' my world, thank you!
5	This Shop has been here for many years. In fact as long as I can remember.It has always been my family favorite. My girlfriend tried to convince me that Godiva is better, But I think I have convinced her that See's is better.During the Holidays they always have some really great products. Everyone loves gifts from See's for sure.They always give you samples when you come in as well.  It smells wonderful in here as well. When you walk in it smells like fresh chocolate.I perfer the dark chocolate over the milk, and they have a really good selection of that as well.Lots of parking outside as well.
