4	This is easily my favourite Harvey's branch in Waterloo Region. The burger is consistently fresh, the onion rings actually have onions in it.However, what especially separates this from other branches is the manager occasionally goes around every single desk and will ask you in person if the order is okay, and if you mention something wrong he WILL replace that portion of the meal without charge! Now THAT'S what I call customer service.UW and Laurier students, forget about your Harveys on campus/in the plaza, come to this one and you won't be disappointed!
5	Normally I wouldn't review a Fast Food Chain like this but there is something about this location that is just awesome. Every time I walk in the door I am made to feel very welcome, which is nice. I often order a quick lunch and don't get myself a drink, every single time they ask me if I would like a complimentary water which I just think is so nice. I never accept as I usually have my own water with me but I just feel that's going above and beyond for a fast food chain. Much like the previous reviewer I have been asked many times when I'm eating in if I am enjoying my meal and if there is anything they can get for me. I don't usually get service this good a restaurants where the wait staff is depending on tips for god sakes. I have also used the drive-thru which is always fast, friendly and efficient. I would highly recommend this Harveys Location above all others.
5	Stop here usually after going to the St. Jacob's market. As noted elsewhere, fast food is fast food, but the manager and staff make you take notice with their service. Very good, exceptional for this type of place. Especially since it's always busy there when we go. Great at the counter, and the manager comes around sometimes and asks how things are. Really unexpected.
