3	Nice friendly location. Could work on the cleanliness of the place but not too bad! Try the Sicilian- with slow-cured ham, prosciuttini, pepperoni, provolone, roasted red peppers and creamy Italian dressing. It's a great panini.The Club-Slow-cured ham, oven-roasted turkey, Swiss with tomatoes, lettuce, onion, vinegar, oil and oregano but don't forget to add bacon! The staff here is friendly and the food is mediocre. Still smells better than subway.
3	Went with co-worker to grab him some lunch. I got just a soda, but his lunch was made fast and fresh. Very friendly workers there. Pretty accessible location. Decent place.
1	Wish I could give this one star. I wasn't expecting much other than a sandwich/sub...unfortunately it was the most boring, limp and flavorless sub I think I've ever had. I'll definitely avoid Blimpies going forward in my travels.
3	Meh. Popped in for lunch today. Nothing special about the customer service. The area behind the counter where the bread is could be a lot cleaner. It seems pretty disorganized.The sandwich was pretty good but pricey at over $8 for a 12 inch/large. I like the fact that they offer sweet peppers!
