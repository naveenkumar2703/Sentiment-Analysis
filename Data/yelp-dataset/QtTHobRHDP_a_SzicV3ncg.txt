5	Love the pineapple papaya tea!
4	Super clean and very helpful staff. Finally got all the new flavors of tea. My lady is a happy camper now.
4	Huge selection of drinks (sodas, flavoring, coffee, iced tea, slushies, hot cocoa, smoothies). They also have the largest selection of gas station food (taquitos, hot dogs, corn dogs, buffalo rollers). Just keep in mind that it's gas station food and not meant to be indulged in, or you might get a stomach ache. Their donuts are surprisingly some of the best (better than Dunkin' Donuts in my opinion). Basically it's a gas station with a gigantic convenient store attached to it.
4	I stopped in this QT yesterday for the first time in months. I love the clean bathrooms and friendly staff. There is a large drink selection and it was nice that the machines were all in working order. They have a good food and snack selection. I will definitely be back soon
5	I like QT, they have the best customer service of any gas station around, plus the insides and outsides of their stores are clean!  What a great business.
5	I absolutely love QTs!  They have the best of everything in the convenience store and gas station line.  I'm giving them five stars for their excellent customer service, the clean environment, the very decent upkeep of their location, and their fresh quality products.It is very rare that I walk into a QT and I am not greeted with warm and welcome smiles and kind words. The managers are super friendly, and always hanging out with the rest of the staff, doing the same jobs as them.This particular QuikTrip has both manual sinks and manual towel dispensers, and I can't wait until the sinks are made automatic, But I wouldn't mind if the towels stayed the way they are!
5	Love this gas station. Never a wait to check out here. Staff is always friendly. Restrooms are always clean. Soda stations are always clean. No complaints here.
