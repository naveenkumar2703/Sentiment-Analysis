2	I really wanted to love this place.  It's so close, it's Fish & Chips and BBQ and other great hole in the wall fare.  Unfortunately, it has never really risen above.  If I really didn't want to cook and it was the only restaurant open in the area, sure I might give in to it.  Beyond that, it's going to be quite a while before I give them a chance again.  The fish was fine, but the atmosphere well... it wanted to grow up and be a seedy dive bar.  Those were it's aspirations, but it wasn't quite there.  There is some seating, but not much.  If you're in the area and really want to try it, it's certainly an experience, but it's not one I want again any time soon.
2	Once upon a time... back when Cher was just Cheryl... she used to come to Turk's all the time! When I was shorty it was so awesome! It was dark, and dank and they had pinball!! Whoo!! Huge sodas and deep fried EVERYTHING!and then I stopped coming with my mom. Recently, I gave Turk's another spin or two and although it's cleaner and bright than what it used to be... it's still not as great. Their menu is what you'd expect from a fish & chips greasy spoon, nothing is really grand or amazing. Just eh. They also have a variety of mexican-american hits. Which are decent. I believe if Turk's were to move a lil east or a lil west they'd do better. With Poncho's and Pete's just a stone throw away it can't be easy to for them to stay in business. I miss the days when they made their own ketchup, tarter sauce and batter each and everyday. Now it's all prepackaged and mass produced for the the not so massive amounts of customers that frequent this place.I'm told on weekdays during lunch they get flooded with calls... but besides lunch - it's pretty much dead. It's too bad, I wish they'd work on their food a lil more. Make it something special. But alas, it's just a lil bit below average. Maybe if they brought back the old arcade games?
