5	Not much to say about the services at the building itself.  It's a federal courthouse, so the space is very solemn and official.  The building contains the U.S. Attorney's Office, U.S. Marshal's Office, offices of the U.S. Senators for Nevada, a jail, courtrooms and a small court cafe.I don't usually review government buildings, but architecturally, the building's facade is unique in Vegas. (cannondesign.com/#/expertise/project_catalog/143).   The entry to the courthouse stands beneath a giant metal grid nine floors above, which is held up by a long metal column.  Visitors walk across a long open plaza with a reflecting pool-style, overflow fountain.  Vegas does not have much architecture of note and the federal courthouse definitely stands out in the downtown skyline as unique.
5	For a courthouse, this is clearly the best in town.  The security staff is efficient and effective.  I have never had to wait more than a few minutes to get in.  The staff is helpful.  Attended an e-filing training there in 2006 and I kept the useful resources.  Staff will also take the time to explain problems with e-filing.  I only wish that the RJC ran as well as the federal courthouse.
5	No, I wasn't a defendant for a RICO case, or even DEFENDING someone in a RICO case, although if you're going to do either, this would be the place.Gorgeous building, friendly staff (including the U.S. Marshal's, who, are usually anything BUT friendly), and just an all around excellent Federal Courthouse.And, believe me, I've seen many a Federal Courthouse in my time.
