3	capnophobia 1. An intense hatred, or fear, of smoking or having anyone around who is polluting the air in the immediate vicinity with tobacco smoke;Do not come here if you have capnophobia!Do come here if you want to smoke in an airport. No food, just booze and a place to light up. Every airport should have one of these f@ckers. Lot's of smoke. Party like a rock star, smell like an ashtray. No cigars allowed, which sucks, since they sell them 50' away.
