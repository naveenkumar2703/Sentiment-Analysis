5	I love coming into this barber when they first open. Sally is my son's barber and he loves her. He is 3 and won't let anyone else do his fauxhawk. He likes Sally because her name is like Lightning McQueen's girlfriend. Cute. Prices are good and the ladies there are great.
5	I was not going to write a review since it may mean a longer wait time for me to get a haircut. However, instead of being selfish-I decided to spread the word. These wonderful ladies do a great job! Each one has cut my hair in the last year, and I have not left disappointed. My usual barber is Sally. I have been with Sally since she had a shop on Jones. I now live in Henderson and travel to North Las Vegas for a haircut every 2 weeks. For me , it is worth it to get a consistent haircut from a barber who is a perfectionist. She pays attention to every little detail, and uses a straight razor to line me up. I have received more compliments from her fade than ever before. Ladies--Thank You-- I appreciate you.
