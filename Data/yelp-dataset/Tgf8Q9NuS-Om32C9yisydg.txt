5	What a wonderful place. The owner, Mo, is a delightful woman who really loves her business. I was trying to locate on of my favorite flowers, Lilacs and she searched for me over a 2 day period. She found them but was honest, telling me that it is the end of the season and they would only last one day. The variety of flowers is amazing and I love a person who works with passion for her business.
5	Very nice lady with a cute accent helped me on valentines day. She was really busy and still had a great attitude.
5	I decided to be spontaneous and surprise my wife at work with flowers for our anniversary. I took in a pic of her bridal bouquet knowing it was a long shot to get even close to it with zero notice but she took on the challenge head on and the results were absolutely stunning. Needless to say, my wife was happy and so was I. I recommend this place to anyone who wants an arrangement done beautifully by someone who obviously cares about what she does.
5	Marg was great. Put together a nice sunflower bouquet with other stuff in there (no idea) to make it look "presentable". Took a lot more care for $28 than I expected.
5	Marg and her team are great.  I came in for an anniversary gift for my girlfriend and they made a beautiful arrangement!  I told them her favorite designer and they came up with a perfect contemporary arrangement.  Today I needed a very fast turn around for another delivery.  Marg remembered me and all my info was saved in the computer which made everything very smooth.  The flowers were delivered quickly and my girlfriend was thrilled again!  I will definitely use them as my go-to florist in the future!!
