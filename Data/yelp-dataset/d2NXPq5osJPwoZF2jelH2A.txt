Really honest this owner No rip off here! My auto shop for life!!!!!
5	I've been going to Amos ever since I got my first car back when I was 16.  Amos himself is a really nice guy, honest and doesn't B.S. you about what needs to be done to your car and how much it will cost.  He has been helping out my entire family for the past 12 years and we all get treated well whenever we have to go.  His main mechanic Marco is great too, he gets stuff done in a really timely manner and he'll let you know what he did and how to maintain everything so you're not leaving with any questions.  Great staff all around and the shop is great.  Prices are really fair and work is hands down the best in town.  GO TO AMOS!
5	I have been going to Amo for many years.  Finding a reliable, honest mechanic is almost as important as finding a good Doctor.  He has earned my trust.  He doesn't price gouge or make unnecessary repairs like a lot of mechanics do.  He services European vehicles every bit as good as the dealerships at a fraction of the cost.  I take my Jaguar and my daughters BMW to him for everything. He does it all.  His primary mechanic, Marco, is awesome. I don't know what I would do without them!
