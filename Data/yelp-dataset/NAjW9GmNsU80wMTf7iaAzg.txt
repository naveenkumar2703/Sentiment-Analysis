5	Caroline has such a great talent!  The quality of her work is unbelievable!  I will have her back to do more!
5	We recently hired Skywoods to complete two rooms in our new home, and we couldn't be happier with the results.  Steve and Caroline were friendly to deal with, efficient in their work, on schedule, and extremely talented artists as well as painters.  They did a faux finish in one of our office rooms, and a metallic effect in our half-bath.  For the final product that we received, the price was reasonable as well.  Highly recommended.
5	They did a wonderful job!!  They were very fair with their price and just an absolute pleasure to work with from start to finish. They completed some faux painting for us on two niches that have never looked better. Second to none in my opinion. Thank you!
