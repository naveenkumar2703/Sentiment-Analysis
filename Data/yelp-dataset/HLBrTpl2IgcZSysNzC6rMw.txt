5	I have dealt with a lot of mortgage brokers in the Phoenix area, and this is by far the best firm I have encountered. My family needed a mortgage, and Harry went out of his way to get me the best deal I could. I was seriously impressed with the customer service; Blake Mortgage went above and beyond my expectations. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a mortgage to get the best experience in Phoenix.
5	We bought an investment property in Scottsdale AZ.  Because we live on the other side of the country, it was important that we had someone that kept us abreast of developments. With minimal additional time on our part, Harry was instrumental in getting us the best rate and meet our closing date.  For fast, reliable, and professional service I highly recommend Blake Mortgage.
