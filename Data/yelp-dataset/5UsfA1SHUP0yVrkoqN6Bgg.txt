5	I love this place... friendly service and a clean and dry car when you leave. I am a premium member and use this car wash about 3 times a week and my car looks awesome! They give you the same service here for $2.00 less for a car wash than many competitors. If you looking for a car wash you keep your car looking new then this is the one I'd recommend.
3	Purchased a groupon for unlimited car washes for 3 months for $18. Which is a fairly good deal, but it took at least 15-20 minutes to get it all set up.It's not a hand car wash but one of those automatic washes. Everything is automated from the moment you drive-up to pay. But, if you have a problem with the payment, it took a LONG time to get it rectified. (Not a lot of staff people on hand to ask questions)When you drive into the wash, there's an attendant that'll offer you a blue towel, which you use to dry off your car.The process of washing is no more than 5 minutes. Once you exit you can drive into a spot and vacuum your own car and drive off with the towel they give you.I had some issues with my groupon and having it work automatically. It took the guy at least 20 minutes to fix the problem. Being from LA, I thought this was a great deal, but come to find out most automatic car washes average about $3 in town.
2	This car wash does not open at seven opens at 730 this is the third time I've been to this car wash the never open on time based off of this website or the time posted that they have on other sites as well
4	I'm a Super Star fan. It's a drive thru car wash so don't be looking for a top notch detailing but they are efficient. There are three automatic payment entrances which is GREAT because there is always one lady in an SUV sitting there for five minutes trying to decide if she wants tire wax and trying to pay in crumpled up bills. But once you are through there is always ample vacuums and you can get yourself in and out with minimal hassle. Add on top that the price is right, and let's go!
