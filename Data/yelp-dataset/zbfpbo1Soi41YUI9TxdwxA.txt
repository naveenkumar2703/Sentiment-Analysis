5	Pretty straight foward, I like the fact that I can ride up to the back and walk right in then ride right out. I dont have some HD salesman to deal with behind a counter, and well, these guys been changing wheels and thats what they do. So like, I liked it. They also found my back brakes to be low. Changed them  too. Not bad. Price, may have been a little bit on the up side, but I cant be sure as I am not motorcycle tire replacement and oh hey we found your rear brakes bad so lets change them pricing expert.
1	Worst service. Two hours for a tire change them when nearly commpleat they take brake for 30 min. I'm the only customer waiting. NO CUSTOMER SERVICELunch is more important
