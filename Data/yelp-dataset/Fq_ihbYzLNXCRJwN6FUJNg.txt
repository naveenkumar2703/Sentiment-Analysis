2	This place is idea for those brave who already have a few bullet wounds.   Maybe some hard core tats too! went here at 8 at night and was already shaking in my heels.  Ran straight to the bubbly, that was overpriced, and then to the register. I was greeted openly by a pitbull/bulldog mix.  He smiled at my tender meatiness as I bought the booze.  Left as quick as possible. If I have any advise for those who actually like the dark side streets of East Phoenix...take the drive through.  Even though I bashed them a bit...they did have like every alcoholic beverage under the moon.  2 stars for that!  Could I suggest a paid officer or...a chain for the dog.. :/
5	Badass little place. Every color size and make of alcohol. Prices are ok and they have a drive thru. Yes its not on a great part of town but you're not here for the location but for the product.
1	I used to come here a lot because it is convenient. Its overpriced as hell, and they have shit selection, but the previous owner (?) Steve was nice. They have a variety of stuff, but not a good selection of anything. Cider and wine selections are ridiculous and the staff doesnt know what they carry, so forget about the drive thru. Cant think of a reason to go back really.
