4	'It's Tricky' is a brand-new magic show just off the Strip. I've seen it a few times already- lots of fun! Being young, the magician/show presents fresh (at times freakish) material, minimizing tired old card tricks and maximizing obscure and original routines. It's family-friendly, I've seen everyone from little kids to old folks in the audience.
4	It's Tricky is a fun magic show for kids and kids at heart. The Magician, Kyle Marlett, is a humorous chap and has a great repertoire of tricks. He's very adept and has a great rapport with the audience. From classic card tricks to a new take on the infamous bullet catch, It's Tricky has something for everyone. Basically it's a fresh take on a traditional show, guaranteed to entertain and leave you wondering, "How does he do that?"
4	Kyle is funny.     I liked the show, but it was short, 35 minutes.  Kyle started 5 minutes early. One family of about 4 arrived at 5:10.  Would have been nice if he showed this family one or two small tricks after his show.    The staff at the box office were very nice, helpful and exceeded my expectations.  Three stars for the show, and an extra for the box office.
5	What a fun time.  You should bring your family to see it as well.  Kyle is very sincere in his performing and it shows.
4	My son's and I really had a good time at "It's Tricky." It is a family friendly show, my boys are 7 and 10, and they both had as much fun as I did. Definitely recommended if you are looking for some quality, family entertainment. Kyle is funny, witty, and has some old school tricks, as well as some new ones, that were pretty amazing.
