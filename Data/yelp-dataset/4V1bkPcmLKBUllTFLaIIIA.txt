1	I have taken my son to this location 3 times now. 3rd time shame on me I guess. This location is close to my house so I really wanted to have a good experience but each and every time I was VERY disappointed with there services or should I say hack job. I took my son to this location today hoping to have a better experience then the last time. WRONG! Once again They hacked my son&apos;s hair it looked like they put a bowl on his head and just shaved around it. I asked them to please fade it better and the girl butchering his hair said she didn&apos;t know how and had another woman help. It took 2 of them and still my poor son looked like a fool. I once again asked them too fix it and girl 2 said she didn&apos;t want to take the chance and mess it up. I was so mad being this is the 3rd time this has happened at this location I decided to call the manager and inform her of her staffs ignorance in turn she was very rude and not once apologized. Now I will have to once again pay another competent barber to fix there mistake. I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND going to this location!!! Save yourself the headache and spend a few extra bucks for a good haircut because here you truly get what you pay for.
1	If you like your hair...don't go.
1	Nothing Great about this location! Don't bother to tell them what kind of cut You want. They will argue with You, & tell you it's the cut you asked for. Terrible customer service! Less than 1 star if that's possible.
