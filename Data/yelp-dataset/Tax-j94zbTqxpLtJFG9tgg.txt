1	Drive thru botched order by not including straws or dipping sauces. Does that warrant a one-star? I dunno, it's just stoopid.
2	I knew better than to stop by here, but I was hungry and I no longer resist the temptation to try some of those "fresh made" Breaded Chicken Tenders.  I ordered a 3 Piece Chicken Tender, Bean Burrito, and Western Bacon Cheeseburger.  It took a while for the food to come out....I guess they really do make them by hand.  The first item I had was the Western Bacon Cheeseburger.....once upon a time, this was my favorite Burger.  Now, it's just awful.  The Bacon doesn't even taste like Bacon.....it's that paper-thin, pre-cooked, microwave Bacon, blech!  And the Onion Rings inside the Burger were very poor quality....I took one bite and the entire Onion came out of the Ring because it was so tough.Next up was the Bean Burrito....it was just ok.  I'd rather have a Bean Burrito from Taco Bell or Del Taco.  Don't know why I ordered it.Last up was the Hand Breaded Chicken Tenders.....I saved them for last because if they were fresh, they'd be piping hot and I don't want to burn my mouth.  I bit into the first piece and yuck!!!  It was rubbery.....just awful.  I didn't finish the rest of them.....what a waste of time, money, and calories. Damn.They get 2 Stars instead of 1 Star because the employees were very nice and friendly and the place was clean.  You can have your Happy Star!Return Factor - 0.001%
3	Grandson loves the large burgers but I won,t go there unless we have a 2 for 1 coupon which they seem to publish often.
