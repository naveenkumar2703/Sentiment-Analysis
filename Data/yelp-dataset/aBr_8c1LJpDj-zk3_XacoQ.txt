5	Being a new-ish homeowner having to make your first call about a big home repair is pretty terrifying. You have no idea how much you're going to have to spend or what company you should use or if someone's going to take advantage of your lack of knowledge. I'm so happy to report great service from the initial phone call to the follow-up. The guys were respectful, funny, sweet to my dogs and made sure I understood what was going on every step of the way. They took a lot of care to narrow down the problem as much as they could so the repair would be as cost-effective as possible.
5	I've used HJ Pertzborn multiple times for multiple plumbing issues and every time it has been a great experience. They fit me into the schedule quickly, the person they send to do the service has always been very friendly and professional and the issue was solved efficiently each time at a very reasonable price. They have given me no reason to shop around for plumbing, they are the best in Madison!
4	I needed to call HJ Pertzborn to have them come and take a look at my basement drain.  I had water in my basement, and it was not going down the drain. I called, and they were able to get someone out later the same day. I did ask that the techs call me 15 minutes before they were coming so I could leave work and get there on time, which the receptionist didn't relay. Two service techs came out. Only giving them a 4 as one of the service techs wasn't very polite with me and was annoyed when I asked him where the clog was. The other tech was very nice and informative. I haven't dealt with other plumbers in the Madison area so I don't know if their pricing was high, but I felt it was reasonable.  They were in and out a lot quicker than I thought they would be, which is nice because they charge by the hour!I definitely would recommend them to my friends.
