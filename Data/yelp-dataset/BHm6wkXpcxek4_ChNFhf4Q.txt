3	This is a very nice and clean gas station. They have a large convenient store, car wash, and air and water station. But they are pretty over priced. I paid 20 cents more per gallon to fill up here compared to my normal Frys gas station in Phoenix. I guess it comes with the location.
3	I've lived in five or six states and Shell (Superpumper) is the one brands that I continue to come back to on a regularly basis. But, now with gasoline prices sky high again, I find that I've started to price shop and Shell is still one of the places the does well. If you live in the north Scottsdale area, the only competitors are Circle K. AM-PM really doesn't have the ability to compete in terms of price and convenience.
3	I've filled up several times at this gas station.  On the plus side, the lanes are wide and well lit.  On the downside, it's difficult to get in/out and positioned near a busy intersection.Return Factor - 50%
4	I have been to this station a few times now, since I have spent some time in this area lately.Shell is usually good gasoline so I like going there and the price is quite decent.They are clean and I get a receipt at the pump, which I have found lately I have to go into places to get the receipt.They have a car wash which is another plus(I love a clean car).The little shop inside has about anything you could want when you are in a hurry, which is also nice.
1	WOW! I normally wouldn't review a gas station but this place is so bad I felt it warranted it. The angle of the lanes is absurd and it seems everyone there is pissed about something.
1	Poor location of pumps. And I HATE shell gas stations. The gas is always overpriced by 10 cents and the products inside are garbage. This is a last resort gas station..
