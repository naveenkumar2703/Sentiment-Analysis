5	This was apparently the only place to get a pitcher of beer on a very late Sunday evening that isn't filled with drunk karaoke, or bad house music. Don't get me wrong, I love karaoke and dancing but I like to go to places where you can actually hear the person next to you.It is a place where you will run into people you went to high school with. Might want to make sure you are wearing matching socks as that could be embarrassing. The bartender (who I really feel badly for forgetting her name) was super nice and let us stay to finish our drinks and shoot the shit about how much this area has changed for a good 20 mins past close.It is busy enough that you don't feel awkward drinking yet not so busy that you can't get a seat or good service, The drinks were affordable and really I can't complain.
1	They suked so bad they flopped..Another one bites the dust..A,B,
1	One word: Assault.  Two words:  Charges pending.   Do not go to this bar.  The bouncer assaulted my best friend--I would hate to think it is because he was a gay male on the Westside of town but no other reasons come to mind.
