5	Jessica is a doll. I've purchased four leather band bracelets. Two for myself and two as gifts. Jessica is a wonderful artist and is so sweet and thoughtful. Support local artists and check out her cute shop inside container park.
3	Very nice products, beautifully made, however sales girl did not know very much about the leathers and owner was not in shop, we bought an item, then when it didnt work, and we did an exchange, owner was there and charged extra for same item that was originally less than whag we bought,.a bit disappointed.
5	What's not to love about custom leather bracelets? Come get one. I have 3 bracelets. One to set the mood.
5	What a unique store! Jessica is talented and friendly. This is definitely a must visit store with great handmade leather products. You won't be disappointed when you visit Container Park because maker based businesses like this are what give it its unique flavor.  Congrats to Jessica for her craftsmanship and presentation.
