4	Always packed which is a good sign! Very good food
3	Another strip mall joint, this place has pretty good pizza, but their entree items are better. Have had some good lasagna there, and eggplant Parmesan. I just don't like the atmosphere... I feel like I'm dining in a storefront ... Oops, I am!
4	I love Nicks!  Casual, consistent, well priced.  Great Osso Bucco, homemade pastas, love the seafood ravioli.  Several locations in the valley but we like the Frank Lloyd Wright one.  Sometimes the service is just ok but lately, seems to have improved.  Nothing fancy, just good food at a reasonable price.
5	I love this place!they have amazing chicken parm and I love the bread they served with olive oil and vinegar. Not to pricey but a good restaurant. I come here often with my family. Love the small family restaurant. You have to try this place!
5	Consistently good Italian food. Reasonably priced wine.  Love the antipasto misto.
5	Nick's is the mom and pop of AZ Italian restraunt must! The food is always consitently great! I highly recommend the Chicken Piccata. :) It is a very casual place as far as decore but the food is what does it for me.  I would have to agree with Ronald's review below. (The two chair in the middle... worth waiting for a better table)
3	I've been to Nick's a couple of times. The place is always mobbed by couples, groups and families. I don't get it, but I guess I'm in the minority on this one.The bread is outstanding, the service is ok, but nothing to write home about. The Chicken Parmasean is so so. I only finished one of the two pieces of chicken because it was so meh. And the Linguini with Clams was unspectacular as well.
2	The prices are about 2 bucks more than their website.  Their sauce had a lot of sugar, not unlike ChefBoyArDee. The bread seemed like it included cornmeal, not tasty.  The service was just okay.
3	A favorite of my wife's. It is not a bad place but nothing exciting it is ok. So when my wife wants to go I usually take her. You know a happy wife makes for a happy me
4	Nice local Italian spot. Nice daily specials. Everything is fresh and very tasty with a nice presentation. I usually stick with the chicken parmesan. The one area they need help is with their bread.
1	How the hell you gonna trust a place to be authentic when they don't even know the difference between "parmesan" and "parmagiana," so they just combine them into a made up word. (WHAT THE HELL IS PARMASANA?)"Parmagiana" is a style of cooking. "Parmesan" is the cheese you sprinkle on your spaghetti.God! People can be so stupid.
5	LOVE! I love this place the greek salad is so addicting I could eat it everyday.  I always get the spaghetti with tomato sauce its pretty basic but the sauce it very sweet and delish!  It is a neighborhood place where you go in and you will know someone! Overall Excellent!
3	For an appropriate metaphor to Nick's restaurant, one need only look to the chicken section of their menu.Piccata? Yes, quite.Marsala? Ahh, of course, a staple.Parmesana? Why certai-- wait. What? What the fuck is Parmesana? I get what Parmesan (Parmigiano) is: it's a dry, hard granular cheese. I'm also familiar with Parmigiana (which means "from Parma," Northern Italy): it's usually used to denote a particular breaded meat/eggplant dish that is bathed in sauce and cheese. Parmesana, on the other hand, isn't a word. One could write it off as a simple spelling error, but they repeat that exact mode in the following veal section.So, there it is. Nick's is essentially a generic place that doesn't quite know its identity, and it does it extremely well without anyone ever noticing.Nick's is a restaurant for people that are afraid of change; afraid of diversity; afraid of trying something new. While I can't say there's anything wrong with ordering Chicken Parmesan or Spaghetti and Meatballs every time you go out to dinner, it's not for me. After all, Nick's would be ridiculed amongst the pretentious diners of NYC, and I feel similarly. Every time my parents take me there (it is my father's favorite restaurant, which is very telling of his tastes in food) I can't find anything on the menu that sounds interesting enough to pop off the page. When I eat the food, I can't find anything about it that is exceptional enough to remain in my memory.But, it is perfectly palatable, freakishly fresh food. I can't help but play devil's advocate and offer the argument that this is a great restaurant for people who like generic American-Italian food and are tired of (or too good for) Olive Garden. You know who you are. Just don't expect any breadsticks at Nick's.
5	Best Italian food in north Scottsdale for the money.  If you know of another one, let me know.  Their antipasto misto is the best I've had in AZ. Linguini with clams is to die for :) Very friendly service.  I'll never go back to Macaroni Grill!
4	Good eggplant parmesan.
4	Nick's Italian Restaurant (13910 N. Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd, Scottsdale, AZ) aims to please with a menu diverse in selection. Tinted windows, location inside a small strip mall on N. Frank Lloyd Wright makes for an unassuming establishment.  Upon entering, you are welcomed into a simple environment with a menu where one can find everything from traditional Italian pasta dishes to dishes with veal or seafood. Their traditional garden salad is a generous portion of lettuce, a sprinkle of tomato, and cucumbers served with your choice of ranch, blue cheese or house vinaigrette dressing ($3.95).   You receive a large portion of salad for this unbeatable price.  The house vinaigrette in particular, is light and coats every inch of the salad with taste.For the main course, the "chicken parmesana" ($14.95) as spelled on their menu, takes a different twist.  Instead of a coated breaded chicken breast, theirs is simply a grilled chicken breast covered with a thick covering of mozzarella and mild marinara sauce.  Along with this dish, a serving of spaghetti with marinara sauce give the pasta compliment to this dish.  There is no lack of mozzarella cheese on this dish; every bite brings a delicious taste to any cheese lover. For dessert, their homemade chocolate chip cannoli ($5.95) is not to be missed.  A savory pastry shell is filled with traditional cannoli style cream, topped with many chocolate chips.  It is a most filling dessert; their cannoli can easily be split between two individuals.With a simple atmosphere, Nick's simply focuses on what is most important - the food.  With a menu with many selections to choose from and delectable dishes, you can find a hearty Italian specialty easily at Nick's Italian Restaurant.
4	Yes, I am a fan of Nick's Italian Resto on FLW in North Scottsdale.  They have a great selection of salads here, works well if you are on a low carb or non processed food diet.  My favorite is the Di Mare salad which I modify to my liking, no shrimp and choice of oil and vinegar dressing.  Vegetarian?  They have caprese salad and pasta choices.  Lunch specials are available too for under $10.00.  The food here is tasty and delicious.  The only drawback to this place is the ambiance and the service.  They have black checked tablecloths, some Italian food decor, looks ordinary.  The service is hit and miss.  Take out is always a good choice.  If you however want good food and great salads, then Nick's is the place...  Buona appetito
4	1st time to Nick's based off of yelp comments and was not disappointed! The service was great. The prices were wonderful. The food was YUMMY! I typically get penne with red sauce and sausage. This was the first time I ran out of pasta prior to running out of sausage! That's what I call loading it up with the good stuff! Also had a house salad which was an extra $4 or so (bummer that not included). A variety of different breads to warm you up. Save room for the tiramisu! Even if no room left, make some. Made fresh in house daily and probably some of the best ever. I'm a value guy. If soup or salad was included with the dinner, would have received 5 stars. Not knocking it in any way because it didn't. I'll be going back and see myself becoming a regular.  It was obvious that everyone there was a local!
4	tiramisu!!  luckily i ordered a salad and caprase salad so i didn't feel so guity having dessert.  it was very busy when we got there so it must be a fav in the area.  the service was good.  would go back.
4	I went here with my mother a couple of weeks ago off from a 'Groupon Now' offer. We shared the chicken picatta. The portion was large and the dish was flavorful. We each added on a side salad - it  was a typical salad for a restaurant, mixed greens with one slice of tomato; per usual, disappointing. However, I got the greek dressing and really liked it. I felt the price was reasonable, but enjoyed it more with the groupon offer. They had a long list of specials that looked good and there were several menu items I would like try. I will check them out again sometime.
2	I had been wanting to try this place for awhile and a Groupon brought us in on a busy weekend night.  The place was packed to the gills, the several outdoor "patio" tables also full.  We were told 10 minutes wait.  20 minutes later we were still standing (no available chairs to wait in) against the wall.  (If the Groupon wasn't expiring, we would have left.)  Servers were desparately trying to navigate the tables and the crowded entrance to serve the patio area.  I admired the fact that most still continued to smile in the face of such a crowd.  Finally we were seated in a high traffic area, our chairs were continually bumped with each passing waiter or guest.  This was not fun or relaxing.About the food.  Definitely not worth the wait.  We both had salads (because the pasta dishes do not come with any sides).  The wedge salad was covered with bleu cheese dressing, w/ sliced tomatoes and onions on the side.  House salad had a very nice balsamic dressing but the salad was 1 kind of lettuce & a couple cuke & tomato slices - we were not impressed, esp. for the price.  Penne Alla Campagna sounded good w/ spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms & chicken - but it was somewhat bland, chicken was tough.  Lasagna didn't fare much better on our table.  I wonder if the experience might have been different on a less busy night.  If they are always this busy, then I guess they won't miss our business.  With all the many choices in Italian, we won't be returning to Nick's.
5	LOVE NICKS! I have been coming here for many years... and the food has always been really good... at really reasonable prices.I tend to stick with the pasta dishes... as all the pasta is fresh and homemade. My favorite dish on the menu it the fresh pasta, homemade sausage, peppers and onions, in a marinara sauce... amazing! I have also had the chicken marsala... also very good. The tiramisu dessert is amazing... make sure you save room. Also they sever Illy coffee which is wonderful. Great way to cap of the meal. My one word of warning is: Do Not overdo it on the bread before your meals arrives on the table! A true testament to this place is that everytime I come in it is always BUSY! This is true on a Tuesday night as it is on Saturday.
5	The nice thing about Nicks is you can take your time over your meal or eat and run.  They will adapt without saying a word. It's casual and you get value. Always good food.
3	Pretty decent place. The kids ad pizza and liked it. I had veal parm and it was pretty good. My wife had a seafood pasta special with shrimp and she said it was tasteless all together. The prices seem to be reasonable in regards tithe pizza, but the veal and special were a little expensive for the quantity of veal I got and for the flavorless shrimp pasta combo. The atmosphere is nothing to speak of, almost cafeteria feeling with little or no decor at all. I would go back to try it again I think, but my wife would need more convincing. Overall, not a bad place, but fits in there with your average Scottsdale meal.
2	This place gets a big "EH" when it comea to food and service. The bread is clearly NOT fresh. It is cold to room temp at best and the texture gives away the fact it is not far from stale. I ordered the eggplant parm. The breading was too heavy, the sauce bland. Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food. My side of steames veggies....cold. I am sure they sat for a long time before my eggplant was plated. My husbands mushroom ravioli in pink sauce was alright, but again the raviolis were clearly not housemade. The food took almost an hour to come out. The prices here are too high for what you get but other than that...I would not return or recommend. The place was busy though, so people must love subpar italian food.
3	For a local place, not too far from home, Nicks Italian works. I love their salads, especially for lunch. Pizza deal is great too. I have to be honest though, the past few times we called for "to go" orders, they never say THANK YOU and or a GOODBYE just the phone hanging up on us. I mean, come on! We're spending OUR money at your business and you can't even treat us with some gratitude when we place an order to go, especially when there are other restaurants competing for business???O.k., there is my rant.I'll come back for lunch but I am saying goodbye to "orders to go" only because you all are not very pleasant on the phone.I really do hope a manager reads this and fixes this problem, STAT.
4	I didn't actually go to Nick's, he instead came to me. I used Nick's for a company catering event today, and ordered 3 things: the meat lasagna, the chicken risotto, and the pasta bolognese. All 3 of them were delicious. The meat lasagna went so fast, we ran out of that before we even got into the second pan of risotto or pasta bolognese! It was meaty and hearty and everything a lasagna should be. We also got the spinach salad that was supposed to have cucumbers, tomatoes and bacon on it, but someone in the kitchen was a bit stingy with the cucumbers, tomatoes and bacon. They also brought sliced french bread that I used to sop up my meat sauce and it was the epitome of comfort food. Overall I really enjoyed the food, and would definitely go there on my own.
4	Nothing fancy here -- good-sized standard Italian dinners at reasonable prices in a family atmosphere. They have a handful of basic sauces that they put on a wide variety of dishes, ranging from fish to chicken to meat, as well as their homemade pasta.A standout is the grilled vegetable salad. Sounds pretty ordinary on its face, but they do a great job with a healthy mix of carrots, zucchini and peppers. The eggplant parm was solid -- several slices of eggplant smothered in mozzarella. Another diner at our table had the housemade sausages (sweet) with homemade fettucine, which also got good reviews. The wine list is short (with a shortage of Italian wines with the except of three Chianti's) but well priced.Our waitress said she'd been there with Nicks for 15 years, so she knew the menu inside out and winked when we ordered things she hinted were good. Gotta like that.
5	Great food Italian food. All homemade. Owner seems to be on location everyday
4	Nick's has great lunch specials! I ordered the Chicken Piccata & got enough of a serving for 2 meals at a fabulously affordable price. Service was awesome, it was also very quiet and not too busy. Don't judge a book by its cover, this place definitely has a "hole in the wall" appearance from the front, but it's gourmet in the back guys!
5	Great food! Great service.
5	I judge italian food by "Is it worth me making it myself because I can do it much better or is this good enough that I don't need to do the work."  I was raised making italian food and even make pasta from scratch on occasion. I tried Nick's because I got a groupon and I love trying new restaurants this way. About Nick's...I can't even make italian food this good! Everything about the food here exceeded my expectations. The appetizer antipasto combo was an amazing combination of italian meets, cheese, and bruschetta. Each item was fresh and delicious. For the main courses we had the gnocci with meat sauce and baked zitti with sausage. Both were perfect. Great sauce, fresh homemade gnocci and pasta, fabulous!!! For dessert we brought home two cannoli's because we were stuffed. Well that night we got to relive the whole expereince! The canollis are fantastic. Fresh, tasty...I really can't say enough about how good the food was. The atmosphere is great, restaurant is nice and clean, service great...I never have to cook again!!! This is absolutely my new favorite restaurant and probably the only italian restaurant I would recommend to people as being as good as mine! Conceited...I know :)
5	Fresh homemade pasta! You can really taste a difference in their sauce and noodles. I was a little concerned going in because of the looks outside, It is in a strip mall and I didn't expect much. Inside was very nice however. The service staff was very friendly and the food was great. The appetizer antipasta platter was the highlight. Fresh meats, peppers, and bruchetta. The canolli's were truly the best I have ever had and they were huge! I think this is now my favorite italian restaurant. The pizza's looked really good and I will be back to try them. My daughter remarked that the capuccino that she had was excellent as well. Portions were good and I had some to bring home.
5	Excellent and consistent..reasonable prices
3	The baked ziti with sausage is a good choice. Pizza is alright but you have to like a thicker and more toasted crust.
5	Hot dang diggity dawg, this is as good as it gets!In all seriousness, throw any of your plans for tonight out the window and go to Nick's. Their pizza is superb, their bread is binge-worthy, and the wait is short. Even their plain cheese pizza has a similar taste to my various fantasies of feasts in the heavenly afterlife.They also have a variety of pasta dishes and other fancy Italian things. Whatever. I just love the pizza.
2	************Like Eating In The Back Seat Of A Yugo***********The servers can't even maneuver between tables.YOU WILL rub elbows with the neighboring table.***********Use To Be A Top Notch Italian Restaurant*********It seems they went on an aggressive expansion plan......about 5 years ago.The food quality slipped.......BIG TIME.Prices rose.......BIG TIME.Now its kinda of..........an over priced Olive Garden........and in my opinion Olive Garden is DRECK .
5	In the 13 years that we've been going to Nick's, every visit has been perfect!  Perfect food, perfect service, perfect atmosphere! By far my favorite Italian restaurant!
2	We go to Nick's about once a year.  For the most part our experience has been positive.I tend to order pasta dishes while my wife enjoys the Chicken Parmigiana.  Both could be better and the place can get crazy crowded at times.  The tight space and food reminds me of Giuseppe's on 28th http://www.yelp.com/biz/giuseppes-on-28th-phoenix  Though I like their food better.Sometimes you just don't feel like cooking.  When it comes to Italian food, how many of us want someone else to do it better?  In this department, Nick's is just okay. The new management at New York 51 Pizzeria (formerly Redendo's) up the block might have the edge on Nick's. Time will tell.http://www.yelp.com/biz/new-york-51-pizzeria-scottsdaleSorry!
4	Let me preface this by stating my mother is FROM ITALY. Finally ordered from here after hearing countless good reviews about this place from multiple sources.  Ordered takeout on a Friday night as the wait was for over an hour.  I ordered the baked ziti, the bf ordered the lasagna. This place is legit.  It's fantastic.  Absolutely great food, quality ingrediants and made me really feel like I was eating in Italy.  The people are super nice and very polite, which is always nice.  The only downside is this place is packed all of the time and it is really very small.  The parking location is next to a Circle K, which always carries a very interesting aroma.  Aside from that this will be a repeat establishment.
5	Very good! Probably best to get there early, it's a small establishment and can get quite busy. The calamari and bruschetta were excellent! I had Chicken Marsala which was very tasty, but a humongous portion! I had a taste of the marinara sauce and Italian ice cream and both were quite good. Definitely recommend it!
4	Thanks to Groupon, we found the gem in our neighborhood.  The dining room is small, so when it's busy, tables are tough to find.  There are only a few chairs next to the hostess stand and it can get really crowded there during peak hours.We've ordered the following menu items:Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Cream Sauce, $10.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=T5quiIz0RxafYkagpoC7qQ#T5quiIz0RxafYkagpoC7qQ10" Sausage & Pepperoni Pizza w/Gorgonzola Cheese, $9.45http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=vIKi17UY1fSyVSRfNzISQw#vIKi17UY1fSyVSRfNzISQwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=U4ODmyuyxB7jSYmpbBIyAw#U4ODmyuyxB7jSYmpbBIyAwBaked Ziti, $9.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=HHBLkID7bubiO48cia_3Xg#HHBLkID7bubiO48cia_3XgThe Gnocchi & Baked Ziti is delish.  They cook the Gnocchi just the way I like it, al dente.  The Better Half enjoys her Baked Ziti with Gorgonzola Cream Sauce and they oblige her with that special order.The Pizza is very very good.  I love Pizza and they do a great job here.The service here is good, I wouldn't say excellent.Return Factor - 90%
3	Wasn't especially impressed. Found it odd that the staff was busy getting frks to the empty tables rather than customers (us) with food on the table. Note to staff: get utensils to sitting customers first. Everywhere I've ever been, when it says Chicken Parmesan on the menu, it means breaded. Theirs wasn't. If you're going to deviate from 95% of the restaurants in the world, maybe you ought to put that fact on the menu? Might eat here in an emergency Italian craving, but won't go out of my way.
5	This is a simple-looking Italian restaurant in a small strip shopping center, but don't let the looks deceive you.  The menu is varied, and every dish I've tried has been fantastic.  The Calzone is stuffed full of excellent cheese and whatever ingredients you choose to add.  It's sized as a meal for two.  The lobster raviolis are excellent, with lots of real lobster chunks.  No fake fillers or small quantities here.  Even the salads are exceptionally prepared and great.It's a little ways from the more commercial parts of the city, but worth driving out to.
3	Nick's spaghetti bolognese is what I crave on one of those "eat your feelings, carb overload" type of days. It is soo good. Unfortunately everything else I've tried (pizza, chicken Marsala, Alfredo) were all just so-so at best.  I've learned my lesson though and will continue to return for the bolognese!
5	Been coming to Nicks for years and its still my favorite place. I keep coming back for the Chicken Parm and cannolis!! This place is a staple in Scottsdale, best Italian food around for miles. I dream about their food. Authentic, classic, innovative - they have it all.
4	The Veal Marsala deserves 5 Stars.Service was good, but the appetizer came out just a couple minutes before our entrees.  Plus, we weren't able to make a reservation, and even though we called ahead, we still had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  At least they gave us some water while we waited.My girlfriend thought her pizza was "just OK," but it was definitely a good value.I would come back just to have the Veal Marsala again. Overall though: ALMOST excellent.
3	Got a touch lost one day and happened to drive by Nick's and decided to give it a go for dinner that night.  I had the Fettuccine Alfredo with Grilled Chicken and my fiancee had the Baked Ziti with Sausage.  Get the Ziti if you order either of these two dishes.  The Fettuccine was very al dente, which some prefer - but it was almost to the point of under-cooked and close to crunchy, not my thing.  The Baked Ziti on the other hand was very good.  The sausage on it was cooked perfectly and the noodles didn't taste nearly as under-cooked.  If you order only one thing from this place get the Tiramisu!  That dessert definitely put this place back in play for us to return.  It was light, airy, delicious and not too sweet or too mocha-y.  My non-coffee drinking fiancee loved it and my addicted coffee self loved it too!  Overall: B- (with a huge A+ for the dessert)
3	This review is only for the location on Frank Llyod Wright.  This location is the main one, which the owner frequents most often.  It is open and very light.  Everyone sits at a table, there are no booth and no bar.  The food here is a bit better then the location on Tatum.  The pizza is a great price.  Large cheese pie is less than $13.00...the sauce is  a tad salty but if you ask them to put extra basil on the cheese it lessens the taste of the salt.  The pasta here is better than the other location and the wait staff it good.  There are many other places to eat Italian food in the area, but this place is good with the same crowd coming in day after day.  The meatball subs and seafood pasts dish are pretty tasty.  Great inexpensive place for linch.
5	Love this place! I have been going for a few years now and have never been dissatisfied with a dish or service. For starters, they bring out a great assortment of bread. I have tried many of their dishes and they have all been very good. I love to get the grilled vegetable salad with grilled chicken and a side of the arrabiata sauce. I have found it to be the perfect combination. My boyfriend gets the chicken marsala with a side of fettuccine alfredo. The fettuccine is amazing. They make the pasta in house and cook it perfectly. Great neighborhood restaurant!
2	Our first time at this restaurant and was not impressed.  It was kind of busy and we decided to wait for the 15 or so minuets. A party of four arrived about  10 minutes after us and were seated after about 5 minutes. After about 10 more minutes we were seated at a table in a high traffic area and were continually being bumped. They did have a seating list but were seating people out of order.  The bread was cold and dry and the salad was nothing special ( way over priced for what you got).  Pizza was above average and my wife ordered gnocchi it was not traditional very thick and gummy. We ordered the tiramisu which was pretty good and the service was good. We will probably pass on returning, the place was very chaotic and loud.  Definitely not a place to go if you want to talk unless you like using your outside voice.
4	Saw this on our way home today and decided to stop in - not a lot of stuff in the little strip mall so I assumed it was just a pizza place.Boy was I wrong. As soon as you walk in the door you see that it's a little more special than 'just another pizza place'. It's clean and cozier than I expected from the outside. My husband ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese and I ordered Chicken Ravioli. Their pastas are handmade (I didn't review the entire menu close enough to see if they all are, but there was quite a good selection of home made pasta).The garlic bread is VERY yummy, I had a piece while we waited for dinner and then used a couple more to schmutz around in the pink sauce served with my ravioli.Our waiter was Anthony - and he looked like he was from New York for sure! He was very polite, he and the other gentleman were very attentive. There was a cute blonde gal working tables, too, she was a little chatty for me - just when I was ready to point out how chatty she was to my husband she started talking about how good the pizza was at some other restaurant.Then she mentioned that their pesto was better than "ours". Um. . . . Really? Then she mentions something about another restaurant to yet another table before we left this evening. I neglected to do my Review from the restaurant, so I forgot what that particular subject was about. Quite annoying to hear the wait staff discuss what they like about another restaurant, over THEIR restaurant..... especially annoying when it's the same food type as the one that they work in.Nonetheless, we loved Nick's and will be going back. Maybe next time we'll try their pizza, I've ready a couple of reviews about how good it is.
4	Very good Italian Food, but didn't quite live up to my expectations...  Wait For Table = 2.5 starsService = 3.2 starsAtmosphere = 4.0 starsBeverages = 3.7 starsAppetizers = 5.0 starsEntre = 3.9 starsDessert = 4.4 stars
5	Where has this place been hiding. Took my wonderfully beautiful girlfriend here on a surprise date after we saw a movies. This is one of her favorite restaurants and I wanted to try it out. Plus take her out for a nice dinner.Everything was very nice. Very unassuming little place in a nondescript strip mall. Everyone inside was very friendly. The food was amazing. Some of the best Americanized Italian food I have ever had. Of course if you want authentic Italian food you have to go to Italy or make it yourself. I got the risotto and my girlfriend got the gnocchi. We shared. Trying bites of each others dishes. I couldn't decide which one I like more. They were both so good. The gnocchi was very tender and fresh but the risotto was no slouch either. It was a great meal. Even the bread they brought out was very good. The price was very reasonable too. Not as expensive as I was thinking it was going to be.We will definitely be back. I really want to try a pasta dish because I am told they use fresh homemade pasta. I think if I didn't like this place my girlfriend would have dumped me on the spot.
4	If you like calamari get the Di Mare salad.   It is served with a house vinaigrette dressing, nice & light! and loaded with grilled calamari & shrimps.  As I allergic to shrimps, I get it with extra calamari and it is so delicious, perfect for a low carb diet! The servers here are so friendly and helpful, I frequent this establishment especially for lunch that they k ow ,e and being a creature of habit, I always order the same item, the Di Mare salad, "sin camarones"!
4	Nick's saved the day before baby Jesus's birthday!We'd had a leisurely xmas eve full of working out, breakfast tacos and going to the movies. Suddenly, it was that late-afternoon/early-evening time (around 4:45-5:00) and we found hanger levels quickly approaching. We had planned for  a Christmas Eve feast at Oregano's like last year, but those assholes decided to give their employees an extra holiday day off. What is this, communist Russia?So we drove aimlessly and tried to figure out who the heck was open on December 24. As we rounded the bend of FLLW Blvd. I remembered my old coworkers used to love coming to Nick's for their lunch special, and that we were in close proximity of the place. Boyfriend gave them a quick call to see if they would be open and sure enough, they would be until 9:00 p.m. DONE.We were one of only about three other tables in the place when we got there, but like I said it was a weird "very early-bird diner" time. Had we eaten at a regular time, we'd have to wait, as I saw each and every table fill up in our time dining (and a line forming!--make a reservation if you want to eat at a "normal" dinner time.)We split lots of things, because hey, holidays, fat, lazy, etc. We started with the bread basket, using the garlic and rosemary (!!) infused olive oil on the table for dipping. I could have made a meal out of the garlic knots in the basket and that godly oil. Perfection. Next was the bruschetta, because carbs are what baby Jesus wants us to eat. Their version uses tomato, onion, capers, black olives and with a shake of parm and a drizzle of aforementioned EVOO, it was outstanding.We decided to be bad and each order a pasta dish, plus a small Mediterranean pizza. I KNOW. WHO CARES. I'M WORKING OUT LOTS LATELY. I opted for the penne carciofi, which had an abundant amount of artichoke chunks dispersed throughout the pasta, all covered in a bright, lemony white wine sauce. It was absolutely delicious, and when the sauce was scooped up with the bread? DONE. BF got the fettuccine with homemade sausage that came with peppers, onions and a marinara/wine sauce and said it was outstanding. The Med pizza had all the standards: kalamatas, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, arti's, feta. It was tasty, don't get me wrong--but to be honest, the pasta was the star of the show. We both said that we need to come back to try EVERYTHING on the menu. The only thing I would have liked more was an offer for cracked black pepper and crushed red pepper , but to be honest, we were so busy hoovering our food that we didn't even ask for these...I'm sure they are available.Service was good. I don't know why but I was absolutely chugging water that evening, which I try not to do in restaurants, but both our server and the busser/food runner were quick with refills. Our server's name was Tony and he looked like a tiny Soprano's extra. Glorious. Like I said, the place was absolutely packed when we left, so Nick's knows what they are doing. We will soon be part of the wait crowd!
5	You cannot beat Nick's for great Italian food. We had loved Nick's when we lived in Scottsdale and having returned there, found it to be every bit as great as we remembered it.  From veal to pasta to pizza, everything is fresh and flavorful.  In a very casual setting, the staff are very attentive and Nick's menu offers a variety of entrees; all of it under Nick's watchful eye.  In Scottsdale, it is definitely the best there is in Italian dining.
4	We love to come here for a casual date night. I always order the Pasta Primavera with gluten free penne and cream sauce. It's not too heavy and tastes fresh. I love and respect that they offer a gluten free pasta. I would love to see them expand the options, or at least offer gluten free bread :)
4	First time at Nick's Saturday night.  The place was packed but it was only 10 minutes before we were seated.  Ordered the chianti which was reasonable for $7.  The bread served in the basket consisted of various types--regular italian, foccacia, garlic knot?   All fresh.  The olive oil on the table which was infused with rosemary and roasted garlic was a nice accompaniment to the bread.  Ordered Shrimp Fra Diavolo which was served with linguini.  It was good, but disappointed that the portion consisted of only 5 shrimp.  6 would have been minimally more acceptable.  How do Chinese restaurants serve 10 shrimp for almost half the price? How do they do that?   Hubby had chicken with eggplant which was a special order.  He had it with vegetables--broccoli, cauliflower & carrots.  The portion was very generous and the up charge for the special order was $2 over the chicken parmagiana price.  I thought that was fair.  Jeff was our server.  He answered the questions we had about the menu and was very attentive throughout our meal.  I will definitely try Nick's again maybe at lunch to check out their sandwiches.
3	Prefer crusty breads at other Italian restaurants. Would have liked to have been forewarned about the $2.95 charge for substituting one sauce over another.
4	What a lovely modern Italian place hiding in a strip mall in Scottsdale! Visited family recently and they took us out to dinner, practically off the plane. A nice, quiet interior, tastefully decorated and with very good service - solicitous without being pushy, a rarity these days. The food was very well prepared, in reasonable portions and served with flair. And best of all, it was exactly what the menu described! I would have given it 5 stars, but there were just too many table crammed into the rather small space. This is the one establishment I would happily return to on our next visit.
4	I absolutely love this place. The food is always outstanding. The service is very good as well. The atmosphere is a little bit cafeteria like but they make up for it with the food and service. Prices are reasonable. There isn't much of a waiting room so if there is a waiting list, you are standing around kind of in the restaurant. The restaurant is small so some of these things are a bit awkward.
5	Nick's is always a stopping point for us when we are in Scottsdale.  We have been going to Nick's for years.  Great Italian food at very affordable prices.  Nick is almost always there when we go so it is always nice to say hello.  Staff is great but we do miss our favorite server, Terry, as she has retired.  Weekends can be pretty busy, especially in season so go early to avoid a wait.  They will take reservations for parties of 6 or more only.  Looking forward to many more years to come at Nick's!
4	Great service, great food. 4 stars only because leftovers so caked with butter I was unable to remove leftovers from styrofoam. I had to drain a solid two tablespoons of butter from microwaved leftovers.
2	Nice restaurant inside. Nice location. Excellent staff. I dont like leaving negative reviews, but the food was "edible" at best. No flavor and everything tasted like it was out of a can. I'm glad we had a groupon that someone bought us or else I would have had a tough time coughing up the $50 for dinner. Maybe it was an off night for them...who knows. Don't think we'll be going back. Try Marco's Italian bistro up the road. Great place.
2	This may be the most over rated place ever!  OMG the stuff is so absolutely average at best. The staff when you walk in remixed me of an episode of restaurant stakeout. I tried it but I won't be back.
5	The best red sauce in town! I highly recommend trying!
5	I visited Nick's for the first tie a few month's ago. The experience was overall very good. I have one complaint to get out of the way: I wish they would switch to a better brand of gluten-free pasta, because the quinoa blend they are using now isn't the greatest. But otherwise, everything was wonderful.The gluten-free menu is extensive compared to other restaurants. My first visit, I had the Pasta Campagna as it was recommended by another reviewer, and it was very good. I can't recall what my companion had, but he said it was delicious. We both enjoyed the grilled calamari, which was tender and flavorful. The staff were very friendly and attentive, and when we had a brief problem with contamination in y dish, were very concerned. I could tell that they took special dietary needs seriously. I will absolutely return to Nick's and I recommend it wholeheartedly.
5	In short, Nicks is the BEST! Fresh and tasty meals. A little pricey but worth it. Their sauce is delish and have never been disappointed. Prime hours are busy but there is definitely a reason for that!
5	Great food. Our server Arielle was great as well. Highly recommended!  We will be back!
5	Best Local Italian Food, Best Staff and Ambient in North Scottsdale.  Nick is always constant  in food and flavor and service.  Our most favorite local hot spot for sure.
3	We had dinner here last night with some friends and I'm raising my rating by one star to three. Everything I wrote about in my original review is still present and I agree with the Yelp'er who thought Nick's as over rated at best. The wine list is sad, with only three choices of Italian reds, all Chanti. No Barolo's, Valpolicella, Sangiovese's, or any super Tuscans. I do realize that chantii is made mostly from the sangiovese varietal, but a simple sangiovese would have been nice. Where Nick's has improved in is their fish offerings and the baked Lasagna. Both were very good. But their meat Lasagna, which is made with a flavorful Bolognese sauce, was delicious and worth a trip.
1	HORRIBLE!  STAY AWAY!!!Last week I placed an order in person for catering for about $150 and pre-paid in FULL. I went to pick it up and they said it I had not paid.  After some phone calls and negotiating, they admitted it was their mistake and they were NOT friendly about their own error.  Then I get home and there is no dressing for the salad.  It's not like I have salad dressing in the fridge for 20 people!  They said I could come and get it.  I asked if Nick would deliver it, as he was there when I picked up the order.  The girl said, "That's not gonna happen".
1	We have gone to this restaurant several times but tonight the service fell to an all time low. It took 50 minutes to get our food without an acknowledgment that they were running late. We finally asked if our order had been processed. No apology when it was delivered. Not sure we will give this place another try when there are so many options in Scottsdale. Consider your options before you choose your dinner location.
2	Our family had been excited to try Nick's, as it received strong reviews. Alas, we found our experience lacking on many levels. The space is tiny, crowded, and sparsely decorated with rudimentary tables and chairs. The service was tepid. After waiting 30 minutes, our food hadn't arrived, and they still hadn't even brought a bread basket. They had run out of rolls. When the bread did arrive, it was the spitting image of grocery store French bread. Disappointing. When the food finally arrived, it was merely mediocre: globby messes of pasta and sauce where everything tasted the same. All that being said, I think we must have caught them on a particularly busy night. However, if you want to keep up with the chain restaurants such as Maggiano's and Carraba's, you need to do better than this, Nick.
