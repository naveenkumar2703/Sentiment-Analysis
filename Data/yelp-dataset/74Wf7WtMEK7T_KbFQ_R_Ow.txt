5	Can't beat this place. It's local, it's open 24/7, reasonably priced, no contracts, the owners are really great.It feels like it's your own personal gym not some corporate monster. Everything you really need without the normal franchise fluffRobert Pfeifer
5	Close to home and open 24 hours is more than I need in a gym but also has brownie points like ESPN on the treadmills. Staff is very friendly and personable. No, there is no childcare.....why there would be childcare at a 24 hour facility is beyond me. If you wanna pay more than $50 a month at a gym like Lifetime that is certainly in your power but if you want a cozy gym in your backyard that is cheap you can't beat it!
