2	Typical fast food burger joint. Nothing special here. We all know we should not be eating this kind of food, anyhow.
3	Decent location with the standard chain offerings. It's close to our apartment so it's easy to stop here on the way to / from work for a quick bite. The food is made correctly and comes out hot. The staff is friendly and efficient with keeping the line down both inside and in the drive-thru.This location can be busy during the rush times, which is true of just about any fast food place as long as they are a decent stop. I'm sure I'll be back here again for a quick and easy meal with an "a-ok" vibe.
2	4 cars in front of us.. Been waiting for 15 min.. now I don't blame the cooks or customer service as they were very courteous but the AWFUL management that understaff  this locations ... seriously some leads needs to be replace there..
3	Well, a churro is deep fried bread usually stuffed and covered with sugar and cinnamon.  We like JIB churros but usually the cinnamon is nowhere to be found.  : (We used drive thru, service was fast and friendly
