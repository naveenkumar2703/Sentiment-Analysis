5	I hired Jim to do a dinner party for me at home for 10 people and he was beyond amazing!  He gave me some excellent suggestions for what to serve, did all of the grocery shopping, cooked an amazing meal, my guests kept going into the kitchen to watch him cook and to learn some valuable cooking techniques. He prepared Pasta Alla Chitarra with classic Bolongese Ragu, and beautifully roasted local seasonal vegetables, home made Garlic Bread with an Italian Tort cake for dessert.   The price was very reasonable. My kitchen was spotless by the time he left.  I have already referred him to 3 of my friends and am planning another dinner party where I will be using him for in September.

5	We had such a wonderful evening dining at our friends home last night! Chef James truly outdid himself! Our food was absolutely incredible, and he is so pleasant to have in your home while entertaining friends!! Our hosts travel quite a bit with work, so having a chef come and fix such wonderful cuisine in the privacy of their own home was really ideal!!! My husband and I can't wait to do the same thing...Chef James would be the only guy we would call!!!!
