5	I've been coming here for a little over 3 years and cannot think of a single complaint except for how hard it can be to make some appointments in advance, due to the large number of patients. But then it's a good sign.STAFFAppointments are made promptly and everyone is extremely courteous. Bills are sent out on time and I have not had any problems with billing/insurance or errors on the bills.HYGIENISTVery nice, meticulous and efficient. Despite my ability to drool like a dog, she has always been attentive and made sure that I don't look like a sloppy drunk at the end of cleaning. And once she is done, I don't feel like Jack the Ripper ran through my mouth either.DENTISTI have not had any unnecessary procedures forced onto me, a welcome change from some of my previous dentists. The dental work I had done was pretty minor, but again, I did not have pain and bleeding for days afterwards, also a welcome change.LOCATION/OFFICEEasy to find office. The wait times are rather short, at most 10-15 minutes if you come right on time for your appointment. You also have a pleasant light covers as blue sky/clouds as you stare at the ceiling.
5	My family and I been going to Dr. Hilgers for as long as I can remember.  I could not imagine going to another dentist although I live 45 minutes away now!  When you drive up it doesn't look like much, but don't let that fool you. The entire staff is friendly, courteous and really make sure you feel welcome and comfortable.  Every visit I have had has been a positive experience, and I actually love getting my teeth cleaned!  I have never been pressured into anything I didn't need or spending money that wasn't necessary.  Going through college they worked around my schedule AND my (very tight) budget which was much appreciated.  I truly believe this practice cares about their patients, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality, affordable dentist.
