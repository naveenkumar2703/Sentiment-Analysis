3	Well, what can I say? It's Dairy Queen. Burgers, fried food, soft serve ice cream. I'd say "meh," but given the food desert that is Verona, with open arms I welcome this iconic American franchise to town. In fact, I rate DQ's burgers the best fast-food burgers in Verona. The lettuce and tomato are fresh. The patties are well-cooked, well-formed and you don't have to peel off the burnt, crispy edges before eating (I'm talkin' to you, Culver's). They beat Mickey D's and the overpriced, unremarkable Michael's burgers. Until a Five Guys, In-N-Out or Smashburger rolls into V-Town (fat chance, all), Dairy Queen will remain the fast-food burger king (small b, small k) of Verona.
