4	Ahhhh, got to love that new store smell. This Sally Beauty Supply has only been open a bit and you can tell. It's clean and spacious and well stocked.I recently went in to pick up some fake eyelashes as there is a special this month where you get a free pair for every 2 pairs you buy. I love stocking up on beauty essentials during a great sale. I was pleased to see well over 2 dozen styles of lashes to choose from, and only one style was sold out.The employees are friendly and helpful with any questions you may have. They are honest as well, I asked if an item was worth buying and was told it was a waste of money. Got to appreciate that!There is another Sally Beauty Supply up there street that I used to go to but it's smaller, so there is less stock. This is absolutely going to be my go to Sallys from now on!
1	I give it one star The store is not well stocked on african american items as it should be. I've never gone to a Sallys and was unable to get the things I want. The staff is unwilling to help you or listen. So in my book they didn't want my money so I help them out and left the store. I find it odd that someone can work in a store but has no idea where anything is. I asked for tweezers and the cashier was like they over their someplace just look good you will find em. So I looked and was very quiet while I looked. Then a white lady came in asked for some hair dye and the lady behind the counter broke her neck to help her. Even walked from behind the counter and walked the lady over to the product. I said well that's my signal to exit this store. And NEVER ever return.
3	I love the location of this area and unlike most sally's this location's layout seems so much more open. I often feel cramped in most sally's. The service is good as well, better than a few I've been too. Will come back for nail polish and hair products!
