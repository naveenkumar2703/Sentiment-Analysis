5	I love Bank of America!  I am always greeted with a smile and the bank manager and tellers consistently thank me by name.  I have often seen the bank manager help out with customers when the bank is busy.  Bank of America clearly has outstanding customer service training and they must treat their employees well.  At Bank of America, I never feel nickelled and dimed (sorry I couldn't resist).
1	This Bank Of America is the WORST of the worst. The customer service is terrible, they treat you like they own your money and how dare you ask for it back. Then charge you an arm and a leg to access your money. Not to mention they were complicit in the biggest financial scam this world has ever seen, contributing first-hand to the the subprime mortgage crisis and the credit default swaps that had a significant negative impact on the creditworthiness and net worth of almost every single American family. I'd trust my money to Bernie Madoff rather than this scum-sucking company.  BANK WITH A CREDIT UNION http://www.moveyourmoneyproject.org/
5	I have banked with B of A for over 20 years and have always been very happy with their services and customer service. From San Diego to Florida and now Arizona, I've found nothing but helpful, approachable employees who seem to enjoy what they do. This branch was very helpful when I was transferring my accounts to Arizona. Soon I will be checking them out for mortgage loans. I'll check back in at that time.
3	I used to be a customer with Bank of America.  Haven't had an account with them for about 10+ years.  I was just using my other non-BofA ATM card to see how much fees I would be charge.  BofA's ATM machines are so different than other banks, but I do enjoy getting my money right away, in and out of the bank in under 5 minutes.
