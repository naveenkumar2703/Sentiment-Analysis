5	Catholic or not, if you're looking for a more modern church with AMAZING music and AMAZING father's, this is the place to go. I drive about 20 minutes to get here and it well worth the drive. The church I was going to was very conservative (in my opinion) and lacked in the music department. Word of advice: if you come here, get here early because it gets packed and if you arrive late be prepared to stand, trust me I learned my lesson the first time around! HAHA! The church is a little plane jane on the outside but beautiful on the inside. There is a gorgeous mural when facing the altar and it's STADIUM seating, thats right, stadium seating which I think is pretty neat because no matter where you sit, you can see the entire alter! Father Jack is an amazing priest who gives excellent homilies, they are always positive, funny, and full of so much energy! There is nothing more that I like than a homily with some UMPH in it! It is such a welcoming church and everyone is so friendly! Overall, this church is awesome and recommend it to everyone!
4	As far as Catholic churches go, this one is quite unique. They've go video screen on the back area, so when the music's playing you feel like you're at an awesome concert. Go St Tim's, you rock da house!!
