5	Friendly competent staff.
5	I've been coming here for a few years for my regular mammography, traveling from one end of the valley to the other, after a) Red Rock Radiology was taken over by Mountain View Hospital and raised the cost of a mammo from under a hundred dollars to stratospheric levels. (I don't pay, but refusing to use them is my protest vote) and b) Desert Radiology botched the test, requiring re-x-ray, and still producing images that Dr. Gardner at the Breast Center pronounced blurry and unreadable.I don't recall how I ended up at the Breast Center initially, but I keep returning because I'm treated  in a professional manner, the equipment is up-to-date and digital, I never have to wait months for an appointment, which I've experienced at other places, and I'm in and out quickly.  The techs are gentle and competent.My only complaint is that this is the only mammo facility that does not provide spray deodorant for after the procedure!  When I questioned the tech (I had an event to attend an hour later and wouldn't be returning home), she said it was because some people have allergies.  (Yeah, the excuse du jour).  I think the real reason is that some people have stolen the deodorant in the past!
5	My Fiance' and I came here for our Birthing Class this past Saturday. I looooved Cynthia & MJ. They were both sweet and funny. They provided the knowledge necessary to help me go into the delivery room with more confidence. My fiance' walks through the house practicing his coaching and yelling out breathing techniques lol. Only problem was the AC wasn't working. I was sweating like I just ran a mararaton, but that wasn't their fault.
