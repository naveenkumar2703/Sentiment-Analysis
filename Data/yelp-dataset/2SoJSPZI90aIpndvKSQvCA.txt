3	I was on my way to the 101 on Main St when I passed by this and decided to pull in.  I found a few good items, paid $4 and change, and headed out again. I got some crossstitch material for about one fourth the new price and a couple of cute pins.  This is a nice store, not very big.(4/22/09)
3	This is a nice little thrift store.  The clerks aren't real friendly but they have a wide variety of merchandise for mostly reasonable prices and I always find a few things to buy.  As with any thrift store, you just never know what they will have in stock on any given visit so it's worth it to just stop by once in awhile to see what's new.
3	My wife and I bought a king sized mattress, brand new in packaging for cheap cheap cheap. The rest of the selection had some gems throughout, but few and far in between. Most of the "good" stuff that was in there was either being held or sold. But we got what we needed, and with some persuasion, we got help carrying to our car! all in all, a very good trip~
5	If you are going by, stop in for five minutes. It is not a great store. The people are. I was in social services which allows me to admire the work they do. If you want to donate something, that would be helpful. If you buy something it will probably be of good value but also benefitting AZ.
