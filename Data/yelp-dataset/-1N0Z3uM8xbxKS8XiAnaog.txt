1	"The office space, layout, presentation gets 5 stars, the customer service you receive from the employees at Corporate Office Center is a negative 10. They will scare your clients off, scare your own staff and make your life a living hell. Their office locations and space is beautiful but if a say, a client shows up at a time other than their scheduled time, they will be told to leave. They will be told you don't provide any services at the locations and if anyone could single handedly ruining your professional image, Corporate Office Centers can do this for you! BE AFRAID!!!! They are dedicated to working against, not with you."
2	I filled out a request online @ www.corporateofficecenters.com to get pricing on a virtual office/mailbox in this location.  I received an automated email response saying they would get back to me in a few days but after a week or so went by with zero followup from them I decided to to call this location directly to get the details.The lady I talked to was nice and quoted me $125 per month and promised to email me more information.  I am not that experienced in this type of thing but I think $125/month is a lot for just wanting a business address/mailbox.I really dislike Corporate Office Centers.  All the poor reviews on Yelp are spot on.  My wife has an office at another one of their centers but I'm going to wait to write a review until she moves out.
