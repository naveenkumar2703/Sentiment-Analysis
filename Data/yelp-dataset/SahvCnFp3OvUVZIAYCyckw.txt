4	YAHOO!!!!  New and Great food north of the 101!Will have to come back and update review at a later date - but just wanted to get the great review out there!
5	My daughter & I ate here for dinner & really enjoyed the meal! We ordered shrimp tacos & the cheese enchiladas. They were fantastic and the service was perfect. Please try the laa cake & cookie dessert! Yum!!!
1	This place has changed owners and names. It actualy has two names now which makes it very confusing. Venues and 34 Easy. I am local and even I could not find this place . I had to call them. Once there service was slow food was so so for the pricey tag. My friend never got her side of hot sauce. They seemed under staffed as well. Won't go back.
