4	This restaurant/bar has changed hands recently. It's only open for Lunch/Dinner (breakfasts on Saturday and Sunday.) The view is spectacular, the bar never too crowded and the food is about average. It is one of Tempe's best hidden bars!
4	This place changed names about a year ago, Its now called Pier 54.Best place to take a date!  *(If you are only gonna get a few drinks while the sun is setting)  Dont expect too much from the food, they have a tiny kitchen inside and cant do too much with it, but they worked hard with what they have.  I was a Bartender/Server here for about 2 years and I still love this place.  Its nice and quiet, its all outdoors, with a beautiful view of the lake, and a dock that you can drive up to on your boat.  It has super regulars that all live around the lakes area, some are nice, some...  haha.  It has some cool live music on the weekends I believe, it closes kind of early but then again it gets pretty cold at night.  The owners are real nice, and they do a catering business on the side, which you can contact to rent certain sections of the restuarant for private parties, even get live music if you wanted!  Great people, good drink prices, service is kind of slow sometimes.  Also..  Great to bring your dog to.  It was and still is a dog friendly bar.  This is definately one of my favorites.
