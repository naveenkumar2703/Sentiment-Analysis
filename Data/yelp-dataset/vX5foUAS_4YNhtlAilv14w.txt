5	Avi has been cutting my hair for the last 8 months and I always leave with a smile.  Not only does he make cutting hair an art, Avi is very flexible, creative and has great vision!  I am always pleasantly surprised by his passion to do his best and his desire to share it with his clients, female and male.  Avi is just awesome!Jujuolui Kuita
4	Avi was very personable. Love the simplicity and down to earth nature of the neighborhood barber shop. Being open on Sundays is a plus as well.This is a great addition to the neighborhood. Definitely would go again for a Classic men's haircut.
3	Inexpensive and good in a pinch or a quick lineup, but I'd rather pay a few extra bucks for a full cut. Avi is a very nice and personable guy.
5	Love, love, love this place ! Great prices and customer service. Amazing haircuts for men, women, and children. And they offer eyebrow threading and waxing! Superior service all the way around. Best salon I have been to! I won't go anywhere else.
5	Great barber and great guy. Super reasonably priced. Old school barber. Sells Johny B products at less than you can buy them anywhere else. Finishes the cut with a electric massage and hot towel. Not to be missed.
