4	I stopped in here while wandering through the Miracle Mile Shops (connected to Planet Hollywood) in search of some unique t-shirts that weren't plastered with anything Vegas or The Hangover related, which many of this mall's souvenir shops seem to be selling. I have a vast collection of t-shirts and prefer those that are stylized and different, but also weave some subtlety into their designs.   I was instantly drawn to this Hawaii-based store's shirts given their unique designs and very bright colors.I especially liked their collection of Maui Brewing Company t-shirts, cartoonist Bernard Kliban's bizarre Cat designs that are wickedly deranged, and some of their tribal art shirts that prominently feature turtles that supposedly symbolize safety and longevity in Hawaiian culture.Meanwhile, the bright dyes they use on their fabrics are culled from natural sources, such as volcanic ash for a dark gray, Kona Coffee for a light tan, chiles for a deep red, and cold hard cash for a bright light green. This makes these shirts instant conversation starters, and gives you a story to tell if you plan to buy them as gifts.
5	Has Monkey not reviewed the only Tshirt store Monkey ever loved? A loyal fan since first visit to Hawaii many many years ago, so lucky to have stores also located in CA & Vegas...  Subtle & beautiful designs on uniquely dyed shirts in beer, ash, chile and Monkey's all time favorite, coffee!  Buy it, smell it, wear it.  Forever!  They last forever if you love it.  Monkey's picked up several for gifts.  Do take advantage of the free, unique gift wrapping as well.  Prices have gone up since the days of the $19 tshirts...  Yet the quality is still there and worth every penny on the tshirts, casual shorts and pants.
