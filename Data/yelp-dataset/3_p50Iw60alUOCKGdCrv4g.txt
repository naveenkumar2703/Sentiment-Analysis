4	I f you look in the dictionary for a classic neighborhood dive bar you will see a picture of Captain's.  The all day Happy Hour makes it a great, quiet place for day drinking with a limited menu of basic bar food and daily food and drink specials.
5	Best dive bar in Apache Junction! The owner, Mary, is a hoot and treats her customers right!
