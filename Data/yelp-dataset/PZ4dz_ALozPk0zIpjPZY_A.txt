1	Well CCR, Transport came to pick our items on 6-12-2011. It was suppose to be delivered in the next 3-5 days to denver,co. They were there on time to pick up the items. When they were going to leave their truck would not start. I was getting a little skeptical already. They finally got a jump off from one of their team members I guess and went about their way. Today is 6-21-11, we still not received our items and no one calls us back.  We keep getting the run around. We can't speak to the owner of the company or the driver of the truck to see where your items are in transport. We keep talking to one person and he keeps giving us the run around and his phone number is out of texas and the company is based out of arizona I urge anyone thinking about using this company do not waste your time. Customer service is poor and I think they are just ripping people off. PLEASE DON'T USE THIS COMPANY. WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR OUR ITEMS.....A CALL BACK.... WE ALSO FOUND THEM OFF OF HTTP://USHIP.COM.. I will keep you posted  :(
1	This is the worst experience I have had in my LIFE!  Do not use CCR Transport.  Took about 60 days to receive all the parts, then saw a huge rip in my 1960's vintage sofa.  I have now emailed them twice since the address is incorrect and phone is disconnected.  NO response from them.
