5	I've worked for Chiropractors pretty much all my life....then got married and had kids.....my body failing me until I came here. As a wife, mother and Zumba Fitness Instructor, I needed a great Dr. to work out my body and Dr. Dave is AWESOME. He's such a cool guy and knows what he's doing. Both my children go see him as well. Love his staff too. Very relaxed and professional office. If you're looking for a wonderful Chiropractor, go to Thompson Peak Chiropractic NOW!
5	Been coming here for chiropractor treatments and massages for five years now. Dr Sipes does a great job and I recommend him highly.
5	Been going to Dr Sipes for 4 years now. He has a great and gentle adjustment technique. I have used many chiropractors in my days and in my opinion he is the best. He did not require new X-rays either.
5	I've been going to Dr Sipes now for 4 years and I wouldn't recommend anyone else to my family and friends.I was never really a believer in chiropractic work until my boss at the time sent me to him one day when i was complaining about my neck.  His adjustments actually work, unlike many of the other chiropractors i've been to in the past that seemed more interested in getting me into a weekly program with them.   I will highly recommend Thompson Peak Chiropractic.  I'm not going anywhere else.
