1	Their prices don't match online prices and they never carry the shoes advertised on sale online in the store. They also do not notify you if the shoes you ordered online were not sent. I waited 2 weeks for a pair and finally went to the store to complain. The employee told me there was nothing he could do and that I had to call the customer hotline...wow really? Makes no sense to me isn't that part of your job? Anyways turns out they were out of stock and were in the process of refunding my money, but no email was sent. I have to give this place 1 star. My experience was just terrible.
3	Staff is friendly.  But the inventory and selection is a little lacking.
4	I buy shoes here all the time very nice staff and Great customer service every time..!
1	What? This store is closed! I went by today and there were people boxing up the inventory and a sign telling me to go to other stores!
