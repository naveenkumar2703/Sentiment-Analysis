5	Hunter Pest Control is not my first pest company. I have been through a couple, and have been very happy to have found them! The only bugs I find now are DEAD! (In the garage).  They come every other month, unless you feel they need to come re spray between appointments. Highly recommend!
5	Courteous, professional, and efficient.  Jeremy explained what he found, showed me what he was talking about (shudder), outlined exactly how he was going to treat the problem and what we could expect as a result.  He answered every single question I had and was obviously very knowledgeable.  I highly recommend this company.
1	Set up appointments twice. Both times the technician did not call to let us know he was running late. We canceled the first appointment due to waiting over an hour past the time range he said he would be at our house. The second time we were given a time frame between 2 and 4 pm. No call from technician again at 4:30. We called and technician finally showed up after 5. We will not be using them again.
3	I decided to update my review. I first rated them at one star, but since then, I have always decided to give Hunter one more try.
4	Jeremy from Hunter has redeemed himself. Very good communication and customer service. Called to confirm the appointment and showed up on time. Very thorough. We will be using his service regularly. Thanks Jeremy!
5	Outstanding service from Jeremy and Anthony from Hunter! These guys are professional and are very knowledgable. I am impressed. Usually it takes awhile for us to find a good honest exterminator, but we found one with Hunter.
5	Outstanding service! We are very happy with Hunter Pest Control and have nothing but great things to say about them. Jeremy is dependable and honest; we could not recommend a company more.
