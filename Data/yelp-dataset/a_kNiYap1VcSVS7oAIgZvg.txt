3	Went to look at an early upgrade. Brian the store sales guy was a scamming ass. He wanted us to make changes, buy a whole new plan, offered free products but quickly changed his tune on this. Come to find out after we left the store he decided we should renew one of our 2 lines. But we never authorized that. But he got the sale. Found this out 3 weeks later. Took a battle to get it fixed. I had to go to the store and he wanted to be a nice guy and help. I explained that he was crooked, and had caused this mess and that I would not deal with him. The only thing getting this the 3 stars is the managers. Orlando went above and beyond and when I walked in Kim was there to take care of things. Asked what colors on the phone and had them there. Had it setup in 10 min's and took another 30 to show my wife how to use the new phone. Avoid dealing with Brian unless you want to feel like you need to go take a shower when you leave the store. He is dirty, slimy, and a down right scammer.
4	This Sprint store is awesome as the salesman really gave us a good offer for a bluetooth and charger.  He even gave us credit for an older phone.  I frequent this location sometimes to make payments at the kiosk but that is only if I am in a crunch.Check this Sprint store out !
1	I'm not one to usually complain but I was extremely dissatisfied with this location. Got ripped off BIG TIME. Make sure you listen VERY carefully and ask as many questions as possible. I can't wait to get rid of sprint because of this!! If you go in make sure you do not get Brian! Nice guy but He's a scam artist only interested in getting a sale, not worried about your situation. .
