5	We actually had a coupon for 25 dollars off.... we had 2 bottles of wine, crab cakes and two entrees... with the coupon it was around 100 bucks (including tip)  Very good food.  The crabcakes were amazing, the service was wonderful.  We will definatly go back...  exceeded our expectations in every way :)
5	OMG! Amazing food, great prices and huge portions, please don't let the location of this place make you not want to go, I know the ElCo (Cortez) is a really sucky place, but Roberta's is sooo worth it, the place is small but comfy and kinda romantic, the service was excellent to.
4	It has been 20 years since we last had the courage to dine at Roberta's, but like fine wine this restaurant has improved with age.  What it lacks in ambiance is made up by a friendly staff and moderate pricing.  Ms. Westie's 8 ounce filet, served medium rare as requested, was very good though decidedly short of prime.  My Chilean sea bass was perfectly cooked - crusty on the outside and moist inside, and accompanied by garlic mashed potatoes, a small fennel salad and sauted spinach.
