2	Sort of competent staff. Mostly hollow-eyed and dull. And whatever you do speak up about your sandwich,  they make them like the ingredients are coming out of their wage.  Ask for extra napkins,  they give you 1 one .....always
1	Horrible service! Unfriendly..... Worst subway in the East Valley...skips on ingredients. ...I highly DON RECCOMEND....PLEASE USE ANOTHER SUBWAY.....
3	Average customer service,  average sandwich making skills, average speed. Hence average rating.
