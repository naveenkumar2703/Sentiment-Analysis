5	I was in Arizona looking for an investment home and came to know of Liz Harris Realty by referral.  We had instant rapport and she showed me the best that Chandler, Gilbert and Scottsdale had to offer.  Real Estate, although I love the investment side, I need a-LOT of help on the technical side and that's where Liz and her team shined!  With enthusiasm they explained the latest trends and news that could effect my investments and helped me choose the right strategy going forward.  I can honestly say her knowledge is steadily making me a great profit and couldn't be more pleased with her service.
