2	The staff is nice, but the clothing is super overpriced. $40 for a plain t-shirt? No thanks.
1	Eeegh. Blegh. Nopenopenope. I don't often write negative reviews on Yelp, because I don't like to be a downer, but for American Apparel, I'll do my best. My biggest problems:1. Way overpriced. $30-$40 for a t-shirt? This is, almost literally, a line from a Macklemore song, and that fact alone does not bode well to me.2. Made in the USA, sure. Also happens to be made by a company with very questionable ethics and ads, and a CEO (Dov Charney) with a background of sexual harassment and general creepiness that would make Charlie Sheen AND Terry Richardson blush. At the same time.3. Clothes are underwhelming. I've seen plain, monochromatic t-shirts, sweatshirts, and tights at...well, just about any store anywhere. H&M in particular comes to mind, and even thrift stores have clothes like AA's. Heck, sometimes they actually DO have AA stuff.I know one retail store doesn't always reflect the entire company, but in a multinational retailer like AA, it often does. And when supporting the store means supporting this company as well as putting more money towards a big chain store with a bad rap...not worth it. I'll pass every time.
