5	I teach at the Communiversity next door and I always head to Fat Freddy's for a great lunch and some strong coffee to keep me awake for my classes.  Fat Freddy's is the only place to eat in the area but, thankfully, it is the sort of place I would go even if there were a dozen competitors nearby.
4	Just discovered this place.  It's right up the street from the Northeast library in Surprise.  Had a bit of a challenge finding it, not well marked.  Look for a chalkboard sign right across from the tennis courts.  At first glance there didn't seem to be much to it.  A counter with large chalkboards with specials and LOTS of menu items.  There was an adjoining area and outside seating that was clean and quite comfortable.  They had tv and free wifi.   Nice casual place, saw people with Laptops and books chillin' having lunch and/reading a book having a coffee or smoothie.We looked at menu and picked (2) lunch plates that sounded good.  I had the Chicken Buffalo dip sandwich with coleslaw, daughter had Turkey Avocado sandwich with potato salad.  We BOTH really loved our lunch!  Nice portion, excellent taste!  SO PLEASED!  They have lots of coffee drinks, milkshakes, smoothies, will have to come back for those!  They don't offer burgers or fries, but that's ok, there are plenty of burger joints around.I understand they do catering as well....Will definitely be back!  When I complimented the ladies at the counter for a wonderful lunch, they told me Fat Freddy's will probably be closing FOR GOOD in December.  Business has been super slow......my guess is because it's kinda tricky to find.  They mentioned they weren't allowed to put real signage along the street (Paradise Lane) next to Surprise Civic Center.  BUMMER......THIS PLACE WOULD BE A GREAT KEEPER for our town!   If they can get business poppin' maybe we can keep them open!HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
