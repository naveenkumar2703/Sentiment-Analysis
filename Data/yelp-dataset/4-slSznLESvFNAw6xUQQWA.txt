5	Excellent pizza for a great price! The first bite says it all! Delish!Great specials too!
2	The "jumbo" chicken wings must have come off of a pigeon, because they were tiny! The five cheese pizza was not very good, the crust was very chewy, and the pizza wasn't very cheesy at all. The Philly steak pizza on the other hand was pretty good..
4	The Hoosier Mama pizza(diced pepperoni & sausage) is delicious as a thin crust. Lots of cheese & toppings. Friendly employees/owners. Another thing to note is pizzas they will do for a party. You can even get a birthday pizza with Dora The Explorer on it for your kids. How cool!
3	We got a groupon deal for this place so we thought we would check it out.  Overall the food was good and we got a good quantity for what we paid.  We got a Margherita, a Champion Supreme and some wings.  The pizza's were OK but there was a distinct lack of ingredients on the outer rim of the Margherita.  I like pizza crust (to dip in sauce) but this was to much.  Fortunately they threw in some extra pizza sauce (on purpose?) so it made up for it a little.  I am not a fan of sausage and peperoni but the Supreme was well balanced with ingredients and others in the group seemed to like it. The pizza crust is pretty good, not greasy so that was a big plus.We also ordered wings and their Gold Fever sauce.  The wings were a good size and were, well, wings.  The Fever sauce was fair but I am not a fan of buffalo chicken wings and that is what the Gold Fever reminded me of.  If you like buffalo wings then you will probably like their sauce.  Me?  I opted for some ranch so I was satisfied.  I enjoyed their cheesey bread sticks, they had a good amount of garlic and that made them very good.  Hmmmm!  Garlic cheese bread sticks.Since this place is to far for delivery we opted to pick the pizza up.  It is right on our way home from work so chances are we will stop in again.
