5	Very friendly environment from the first day. Laid back also, u never feel uncomfortable. The staff are knowledgeable and easy to talk to. The Dr. is amazing and I would definitely refer all my friends and family in need of care there. They focus on your individual needs and not what they think may be wrong with you like other places tend to do. Absolutely love this place. -Kayla R.
