4	This review is for the park grounds itself. We took our dogs here a few times for a walk- trails, small BBQ areas, basketballs courts, a community center, and a small skate park (located in the front) as well. It's kind of dark at night in the trail area, so if you have one handy in the car, bring a flash light. The park is small, but it's not too crowded, which is very nice- probably due to the fact that it's located in a residential area. The majority of the people here are in the skate park (which is lighted) or on the basketball courts. Sometimes there will be people playing football on the grassy field. Since, it's not crowded at all, parking is really easy to find. We go around multiple times, since this park is on the tiny side.
4	Small and Quiet Park.We drove past it several times before finally checking it out. I think the skate park always hindered me. But it is never busy, seems to be frequented by the same people. We normally go the same time every Saturday morning. It's the perfect place to take my son for some playground fun and then he run around in the water sprinklers. It's always clean and has a huge grassy area. There are a few BBQ pits in different areas, so I love that they are spread out.They also offer basketball courts and a "workout" area. I have only gone inside the community center once and the staff was very helpful. Only wished they offered toddler classes as well.
3	A nice park with several playgrounds a "cultural center" that is never open, skate park, basket ball court, and splash pad. Theres also some grassy space and a tennis court. I used to come to this park a lot more. The area has become more run down and they dont keep it up very well. Lots of trash strewn about. Still, if you live in this part of town, this is probably the "most decent" park.
