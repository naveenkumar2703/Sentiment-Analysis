4	Stopped into this very clean, stylish Souper Salad for lunch today, landing in a comfortable booth in the atrium.  The friendly server brought my drink right away & kept in touch throughout my meal, as has always been the case for me at every Souper Salad I have tried.They always have a couple of pre-tossed salads at the head of the salad table, at least one different each time you come, & today there was an "Apple Walnut" salad that was just great!  The items on the rest of the salad line vary day by day also, to keep us interested, & this time one special goodie was "Loaded Potato Salad".  It was SO good!  Then there were the "Roasted Vegetables".  This was a medley of eggplant, zucchini, different kinds of mild peppers, & more.  It may not sound like much, but it was really good too!  Next they had SIX kinds of soup out today, including their always excellent chili, & every one of them was delicious.  The sausage pizza was good, too.The menu is the same at all the local locations on a given day, but each is laid out differently & has it's own character.  This is my new favorite of all the Souper Salads I have been to in the Valley... it was such fun eating here.  On top of that, it's only $5.99, even on Sunday!
4	Very friendly staff, massive salad bar and their vegetable beef soup is fantastic with a shot of sriracha "rooster" hot sauce.
2	Super duper friendly service, but I am here to eat, and it is mediocore food at best.
4	I've been eating at Souper Salads since the first appeared in Phoenix 15-20 years ago. I like that they're more affordable the some competitors.  It's pretty basic for seating and things but the salad bar is long and full of standard salad fixings. The salad here is usually fresh and I have no complaints at all.  My kids would eat here 3x a week if I'd let them.
4	Sadly, this Souper Salad has closed.     :-(
