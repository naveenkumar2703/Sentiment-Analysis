4	So excited to have a new coffee shop open up in this space (that used to be Royal Coffee Bar). Went there today for the first time and enjoyed the experience. They make their own Chai, and it was delicious -- just the right amount of spice. Can't wait to go back and try the pastries.
4	Finally a coffee shop by work!  The muffins are simply delicious.  I had pumpkins, lemon poppy seed and blueberry to date.  Earlier today I tried the ice tea.  It was flavored and infused with a berry shot - simply delicious.  A good place to sit back read a paper and kick back.
3	Meh. Clean, small, with funky art on the wall. Had an espresso, which was mediocre, but was only charged 50 cents. The barista seemed cynical and disinterested. Coin-meter parking all around, so not a place I'd hole up for an afternoon. But perfectly suitable for a short coffee break.Maybe I'm still in denial about the lack of cafe culture in this vast expanse of concrete.
