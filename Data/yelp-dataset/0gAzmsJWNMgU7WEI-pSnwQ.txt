5	I love they have a diner style area where you can have a sampler order of sod's of the world! I heart coca cola floats too! And you can buy Coke in the old school glass bottles!
1	I Love classic coke, but was sadly disappointed when I had a coke from the McDonald's at 1343 Silverado Ranch blvd in Las Vegas. This is the third time I've tasted poorly mixed Co2 and syrup at this location. Are they trying to cut cost by dispensing more Co2 then syrup? I would have returned to the store to complain, but I had driven off by the time I took my first taste. Someone or the Coca Cola Rep please change the bag in the box or balance the mix so I can taste a true coke, I would hate to cross over to another brand over this continued issue at this McDonald location. I expect my coca cola experience to be excellent with each drink I consume.
