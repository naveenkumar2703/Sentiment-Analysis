2	I have been with Bank of Nevada for 10 years. It used to be Bank West Of Nevada and had much better customer service, less fees and more personalized. They are just like the other big soulless banks like Us Bank, Citibank and Chase. My friends keep recommending credit unions. Maybe I'll give it a try!!
1	HORRIBLE!!!! HORRIBLE!!!! NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL! I have had a business account with bank of nevada for over 11 years and they have no customer service at all atleast at the henderson branch. Cheryl is the worse!!! TONS AND TONS OF FEESMy advice don' t invest your time or money into this bank!!
1	This has to be the worst institution i have ever encountered, their service and customer relation is disgraceful, the entire organization is at best a complete waste of time at worst offensive.We never choose this bank but was absorbed when they took over Service 1st Of Nevada, since the very first day we went to the branch on Eastern me and my wife looked at each other and was like REALLY???And even if you of convenience and sheer sense of belonging would try to make it through by doing everything yourself their online banking is an absolute disaster, it takes 5 passwords to get to bill pay, FIVE, on top of that no mobile banking or ANY other convenient features all other institutions offer, and shockingly absolutely no support.We changed all accounts to another local credit union, do NOT BANK HERE.
5	Have used them for several years (10)and have had nothing but good experiences.  Feel like they are always looking out for the customer.
