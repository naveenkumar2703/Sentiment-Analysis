3	A receipt coupon for a $20 oil change from Fry's brought me to Midas. And I was also 1k miles past due for an oil change. I called ahead to make sure they could accommodate me and was told that they were busy but come in about 2 hours and they should be clear. So I showed up 2 hours later and they were able to take me right away. The guys there were professional and found some other repairs I needed. They took the time to actually show me the problem areas. The manager was supposed to provide me an estimate/pricing on the repairs but when I mentioned that I wanted to run the problems by my regular mechanic and compare costs, he left off the estimate on my receipt. Of course, I didn't notice until I reviewed my receipt.I brought my laptop with me because I saw that they had wi-fi and sometimes these oil changes can be longer than an hour. Well, the wi-fi didn't work but at least my service time was only 45 min and the Cardinals' game was on TV so I had that to keep me preoccupied for a little while. I'll start at 3 stars and once I talk to my regular mechanic I can see how accurate they were with their assessment.
4	Definitely make an appt before you go. I liked the low key sales approach. They told me my fuel injector needed replaced but for $89 I told them I would wait and check with my mechanic after reading the other review. Plan on being there for 45 min though.
5	I got my brakes checked out here and i feel they were very nice and explained everything to me honestly, usually I feel pressured to get more done than what I intended when I go to auto shops but they weren't pushy at all and they even let me use the coupon I had for $50 off. I will def come back here for any further service needs. Nice people here for sure.
1	Do not take your vehicle if you value your sanity and your money. This was the worst auto repair experience I've had and if I never have another experience like this one, it would still be too soon for me.
