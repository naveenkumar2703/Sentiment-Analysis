5	Wow--this place really is jiffy!  I got my smog check and renewed my registration for the DMV right there in 7 minutes--I clocked it!  Highly recommended!
5	Tech was incredibly friendly, took about 5 minutes while we chatted. Did my reg for me!!! No waiting in line at the DMV for me ever again (they charge a $10 fee which in my opinion is well worth avoiding 2-3 hours of monotony at any DMV office).
5	The service was fast and friendly. It's just north of the Summerlin Parkway at Buffalo. It's a little shack in the parking lit if the Lowes. There's a little sign that says "If the service is good feel free to tip" And the guy does deserve a tip. he has a great attitude about life.
5	Great service, fast & friendly!  I go there every year.  Got the $4 off AND was told they will accept other company's coupons, yay!
5	No nonsense kiosk. Very professional, in and out in minutes. Luckily for me it's down the street from where I live. The techs are friendly yet professional like myself and others have stated earlier. Love this place and wouldn't go anywhere else
