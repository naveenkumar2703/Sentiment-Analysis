4	I was driving along the shitty part of Las Vegas Blvd one night around 1am, headed to check out those creepy, decaying mannequins out in front of the Talk of the Town strip club with my pregnant girlfriend from Arkansas. We passed by a new storefront chock full of artsy wackiness, and despite the late hour there was a man out front fussing around with the window display. So I screeched to a halt and went in to check it out.IT WAS AWESOME! Run by Leroy Lopez, aka "The Gay Elvis" (so called because he's very flashy in his manner of dress), this place stocks all manner of bizarre, flashy Vegas-y furnishings, home accents, art and clothing. The prices are somewhat high, but they're willing to work with you -- I got a BAD ASS Wonder Woman costume for a really good price...at 1am on a Tuesday morning, no less. And THAT's why I love living in Vegas!
5	Love this store!!!  Alex (Leroy) is always a huge help when I'm there.  I always hit the store up when I'm in town to see what fun things he has.  Bought some of my favorite pieces of clothes there.
5	Alex's place is a blast...& so is he!!! He is such a sweetheart & so helpful. The store is filled with amazing furniture, clothing, accessories, art & my personal favorite...shoes! Actually, there is one less pair of crazy hot shoes there as my fiance surprised me with the pair of blue sequined pumps I had tried on!Thank you so much for all your styling & help Alex!!!! I will definitely come back to see you next time we are in Vegas!
5	Love this place. Real kick in the pants. So much fun
