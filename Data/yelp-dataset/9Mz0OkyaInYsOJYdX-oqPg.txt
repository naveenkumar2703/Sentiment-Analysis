4	Received a Certificate in Electroneurodiagnostics from GateWay. I had awesome teachers who worked in the field and did everything possible to provide the best education experience for us! I feel blessed to have gotten to experience my education with them!Knocked off a star because they started construction and knocked off the overflow parking lot with no notice of where to detour to. It took a couple days to figure out where the new parking overflow was moved to. I don't know if it was notified to students and I missed it or if there was a lack of communication on their end.
5	Yes, I love Gateway community college. I first received college credits from here while I was in high school. The set buildings are indoors so if you are taking general classes the main building is an indoor facility, and that is where the cafeteria and main computer labs are. The health programs building is indoors as well so it is a much welcome relief in the summer here in sweltering Arizona. The teachers here are great, I received my Health Unit Coordinating certificate from here. All of the health programs are extensive but you learn a lot and there is a sense of community at this school. They offer a lot of lucrative programs here such as x-ray technician programs, nursing, respiratory ect.
5	Love GatewayCC! The best Nursing Program! I love all my instructors and am so glad I ended up here!
3	Probably a great school for the right student/faculty members. It just was not for me.
