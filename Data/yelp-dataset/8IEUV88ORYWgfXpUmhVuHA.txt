3	It's great to have an international market of this size, but shopping here is a bit of a safari. Strange smells (pee pee bathroom), wildlife (flies) and expired foods around every corner. I'm giving it three stars because of the wide and diverse selection of dry and canned goods, but check EVERY label, because there is no telling how long something's been sitting on the shelf here. The prices are hit and miss, but considering how much of the items are imported, it isn't a dealbreaker. If you like Vietnamese, Thai and Filipino food this is a mecca. Interesting selection of exotic fruits and a decent selection of seafood and meats. Just pay attention to labels (if you can't read the label either ask for assistance or leave it be) and you should be fine. There is a small cafe and sundry shop also, but neither of those places were manned when I went. Good luck!
1	Not a fan of this store as it really smells and doesn't have a lot of stock on the shelves.
