5	Great bank, super friendly staff and, well, there's always candy LOL. Can't beat that.
4	Customer service depends on when you go and what location.  I have never been in the Fort Apache location, I only go through the drive up ATM machine.  There is never a line, I get to sit in my car and it takes two minutes, no hassle!  love it!
1	I've been coming here for the last 6 months or so but only once a month for business reasons. Let me just say how much I HATE BOA. EVERY SINGLE time I come here they always have a long line and only 1-2 tellers, WTF?! seriously though, you would think they would want to actually provide customer service by cutting the lines in half and adding more tellers to make the lines go faster but I guess not. This is exactly why I do not bank with BOA. If I didn't have to come here once a month then trust me, I sure as hell wouldn't be coming back. Oh and did I mention they don't even have a drive-thru window for teller assistance??
