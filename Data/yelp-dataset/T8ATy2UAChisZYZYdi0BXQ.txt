4	This appears only to be in Vegas.  It is a chain store that appears in all outlet malls in Vegas, at least the ones I been too.  It is both guys and girls and pretty cheap.  I bought my motocycle jacket for 20 bucks there once.  They have jeans, funny T-shirts, nicer button ups, snap ups, and trendy polos.  They have a girls section too with whatever teen and 20 something year old girls wear. Walk in and see if it's for you.
1	I pretty much hate going into this store. The prices are cheap, but man the employees are RUDE. It's like they're trying to ignore you the entire time and get completely irritated when you try to ask a question or for any help. But like I said, you can find all kinds of clothes for less than ten bucks here. Just remember you get what you pay for and maybe you won't be upset when the clothes are falling apart when you're trying to wear them the second time.
2	Ok, granted I came on one of the busiest shopping weekends of the year (Saturday after black Friday), but the place was a mess!  Clothes tossed everywhere.  They had a great deal on jeans, so I wanted to get a couple of pairs.  But it was almost impossible to find or even go through the display because sweaters, and all other different types of clothing were piled on top of the stacks of jeans! Crazy!  (I normally like shopping at Rue)Of course, the store was super busy, lots of people, so it was really hard to look through the store.  After sifting through a couple of piles of jeans for my size, I gave up.  Did a run through the store, and lost my appetite to spend my $$ there.  Oh well. Next!
