4	I've only ordered the $5 hot-n-ready pizzas, but they're great if you're in a hurry. Service is prompt and the pizza is tasty, especially considering you're only paying five bucks.
4	$5 pizza, OK wings, awesome crazy bread... What more needs to be said. i will say this location is a bit cleaner than most but all-in-all it satisfies my craving for pizza with minimal damage to wallet.
4	I do love their $5 pizza and how it is always ready.  It is very convenient. The wings are so-so, so normally I just go for the pizza. The staff here are always friendly and the service is quick. They always try to ask you to add on crazy bread or wings, but a simple "no thanks" does the trick.
