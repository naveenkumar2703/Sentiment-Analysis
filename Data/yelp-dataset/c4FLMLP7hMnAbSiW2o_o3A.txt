4	My mom and I ate breakfast at this cute restaurant two days in a row. Both my egg and cheese sandwich and omelette were straightforward, fresh and tasty. The contents of the omelette were wrapped in egg that was about the thickness of a crepe. My omelette had bacon in it. I asked for the bacon to be burned and unlike some other places which  are unwilling to comply, they burned it! Because of the heat, I was glad to see they weren't trying to go for a gigantic thick and heavy omelette. The egg and cheese on an English muffin was just that. They didnt try to sneak in any butter or anything on the bread. I had an iced hazelnut mocha which was refreshing and also huge! I had to take most of it to go.
2	We were in town for the Art and Wine Festival and needed some lunch.  Lousy, fairly expensive food, but pretty good service.  I tried the pulled pork sandwich for $10.95, the pork had too much sauce and it was too sweet.  The bun is just a plain raw bun, not toasted or anything.  Fries and onion rings are fine.  We also tried the burger (also $11) and the sliders.  Lousy burger, it's grey, tasteless cadaver-meat.  Think school cafeteria burger only thicker.  Again, no toasted bun, not ketchup/mustard/mayo.  Just a plain, bland $11 burger.  Someone in our group tried the taco salad and enjoyed it.  Our waitress was nice and kindy offered to let us take our remaining drinks to-go.
3	The menu is big and looks good from the outside, but when you get the food it is just ok.  I think it's a bit overpriced, too.  The servers are nice, though, and they do a lot of advertising and promoting, so I have to give them props for that.  I prefer the Sundial Cafe - their patio is much better.  Saguaro Grille is MUCH better than Venues, though... at least the servers are prompt, nice, and attentive!
