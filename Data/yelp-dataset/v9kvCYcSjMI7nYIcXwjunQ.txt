5	Bryan is a very professional agent. He sold our home in the middle of this mad market last year; he was realistic and found ways to better promote our home. His market analysis and knowledge of the area put us in the right price that got our home sold, without having to give it away. I recommend him for all of your Real Estate needs.
5	Bryan is very efficient and professional.  Not only has helped me with real estate questions but has helped many people I know.  This market is tough and he has weathered the storm.  He broad knowledge base in the industry is a great quality and because of that I have recommended him to many people.  Some agents' bottom line is their commission check which makes it feel rushed and impersonal, Bryan isn't like that.  He listens to your needs, wants and what you can really afford.  Home buying is a daunting task, but he makes it not as scary.  He is able to steer you in the right direction as well if you aren't really sure on what you want.  His personal, customized service makes him stand out in the industry.
5	I heard about Bryan Hamby through a friend and we started the process of buying my first home right away.  When I used to think of real estate agents, I always considered them the "lawyer" type but Bryan changed my mind.  He was on top of everything from the first phone conversation....to showing me homes....to connecting me to a lender....and even called me to make sure everything was okay when I had already closed and moved in.  Obviously he knows what he is doing.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!   Thanks Bryan.
5	Best real-estate agent ever! Bryan made the entire process easy. We got the perfect house for a great price. we couldn't recommend him enough!!
