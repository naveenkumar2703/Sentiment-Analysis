5	Dr. Fern was referred by friends who have been seeing when they need to for many years, so I tried him out, due to a recent injury. He has really helped me as well. He is skilled Doctor with premium equipment and staff. Tanya give a excellent message as well.I have seen many Chiropractors over the last 30 years due to various injuries. All of varying skill levels. I'm a big & tall guy and most Chiropractors are useless with us. He had no problem.
5	I went in for acupuncture treatments, saw Dr. Foo, oops! I meant Dr. Fern and I only have two words: IT WORKS!!!Please see Dr Fern today...I'm sure you'll be a satisfied customer!
5	Great chiropractor!! I have been getting adjusted for over 12 years by many......many chiropractors and Dr. Fern is absolutely one of my favorites. Don't let the small mom and pop operation fool you, it's actually better than the huge cookie cutter clinics out there. If you're looking for results, this is the guy!!! I'm so happy I found Dr.Fern.Only bad thing....office is pretty hard to find, it's in the middle of a medical plaza....just call ahead for specific directions.
5	Dr. Fern went out of his way to explain precisely the course of action he was going to take to alleviate the pain from my injury. I was impressed.
5	Dr. Fern does an amazing job!  I was in a car accident and my neck and upper back was in pain.  I started feeling better after my first adjustment by Dr. Fern.  Now I'm 100%! He and his staff are very friendly and skilled.  The massage therapy was top notch, as well!I strongly recommend Dr. Fern!
