5	I have enjoyed deep tissue massage, hot stone therapy massage and most recently, Thai Yoga massage from Veronica at Vivid Soul. If you've never tried or heard of Thai Yoga massage - you must check it out!  Veronica is absolutely wonderful at her craft. She gets into the deep knots in my shoulders (I sit at a computer all day) and she's always happy to customize my session to my needs/desires of the day.  I have tried many Massage Therapists in my day, but Veronica is my all-time favorite because our sessions are so very effective ... and also because she's such a lovely and inspiring person.  The Vivid Soul office is great and I love that I can book my appointments online.  Sean and Veronica are both extremely professional and I couldn't recommend them more highly.
5	Love the new office! Sean and Veronica  are very professional and knowledgable regarding different massage techniques.  They are focused on customizing your massage to whichever areas are giving you the most trouble. Working as a nurse- I destroy my back on a fairly regular basis. It is so nice to see a massage therapist that is really listening to what your needs are. Looking forward to an appointment with Veronica this weekend!  Would highly recommend- such a better experience than the chains out there.  Easy to schedule on-line as well!
5	I've visited a couple times now and this place is great.  They do a good job of giving you the kind of massage you want/need (aka - they don't turn you to hamburger unless you want that).  They are totally reasonable price-wise (thank you yelp coupon).  And best of all, they don't ruin your zen by trying to sell you lotion, t-shirts, and a monthly subscription to massage prime when they are done!  This is now my go-to place for a massage in town.
