3	It was fun while in University, but if you're past that stage it's just the locals... the line ups are long during the hot nights and it's not really worth the wait if you don't know everyone inside.
1	Eeek! You can feel the testosterone in the air at Caesar's. Look someone the wrong way and you've got a flying fist coming straight for you face. The music lacks variety and they play the music waaaay to loud! Maybe I'm just too old for this.
4	I am not a student (I'm 34) so thought I would offer a different perspective on Caesar's.   I went there on Tuesday night to try their half-price appetizers.   Each appetizer cost around the $5-6 mark so half of that seemed like a good deal.   The portion size depended upon the appetizer ordered, but overall good value for money!  Each person at the table ordered 3 appetizers and left feeling full.    The caesar salads were really good, as well as the soups.Not a lot of people there at all on Tuesday nights but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't go any other night.
