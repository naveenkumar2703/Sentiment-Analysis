4	Handy gift shop near the castle.
4	Apart from the, quite frankly, awesome name, Thistle do nicely is rather samey to the other tourist tat shops that line the Royal Mile. It has an abundance of shortbread, Scottish themed jewellery, tartan teddies, See-You-Jimmy hats, fridge magnets, Scottish flags and pretty much items you'd only ever buy if you were a tourist. Which means my dealings with this shop are seldom, apart from when I went to teach English in a high school in Germany and literally had to take a suitcase full of tat.The prices in Thistle Do Nicely are quite reasonable and the hilarious name deserves a star alone.
4	As a sucker for a pun-laden name, I'm going to have to let my heart rule my head on this one. Deep down I know that this shop shovels all the same shite (try saying that quickly) as every other ruthless, penny grabbing enterprise along The Royal Mile.But I also know that whoever the owner is, they've got a sharper wit than most, so that extra star is well deserved.
