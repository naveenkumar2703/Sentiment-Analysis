4	First off, I love Mexican food so I know what to look for. I have to have my hot sauce just right and the food cooked to perfection.  I have to say that they make their food just right for me. I ordered a carnitas burrito and the meat was fried perfectly and very well marinated.  Only one negative thing was I'm not convinced the meat was fresh.  I can kinda taste thw meat a bit stale. Kinda sucks cause everything else was perfect. I'll give this place another try and update a new review.66
2	Not one of the better Roberto's in town. Salsa is so so and they charge $2.89 for plain chips! Everyone else charges a buck. Food is decent.
4	Service is always good, and food quality is consistent. This location is also very clean!
5	By far my favorite location. It is newer and really nice. I call in my orders and they are ready to go. Staff is nice and friendly. Location is very clean and well put together!
