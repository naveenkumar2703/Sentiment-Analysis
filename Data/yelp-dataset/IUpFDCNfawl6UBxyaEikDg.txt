1	Order 2 large Chilis2 spicy Chicken Nuggets2 large Drinks (Fruit Punch and Diet Coke)Simple order you would think...........NOT2 large chilis were filled only half fullNo spoons to eat it withDoes Diet Coke sound like Regular Root Beer?I will keep writing reviews on this place until they change their ways. Give someone else a job if you don't want to work there.
2	Seemed like a dirty WendysObviously food is always good, but i didnt like the feel of this place. Next time if i have to stop here ill just use the drive thru.
1	First of all, I am new in this area visiting my aunt from the hospital. We went to get a drink at this Wendy's and the first door was closed. So we thought lol and then we saw a different door and we found out that door was just stuck. And the girls working there were like laughing about it. And I guess they were like you need more muscles or whatever. Rudee!! They were like being all clumsy knocking stuff over and laughing. This girl came out from the door from the register and locked the girl out I guess and the girl locked out threw some cup lids at her. Totally unprofessional. I wont be coming back here again.
