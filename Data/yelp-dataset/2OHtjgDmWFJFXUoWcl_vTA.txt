5	Where Walgreens at McDowell & Indian School on 107th Ave didn't have CVS did and great customer service and lower prices. Goodbye Walgreens & Hello CVS.
5	Thanks to Jenn and Isabel for brightening my morning with cheerful, friendly, and helpful attitudes!
5	We use to go to the Walgreens on 107 and McDowell Rd. The CVS is a little our of our way but worth the drive. The Pharmacy staff is always so wonderful and every one of them make sure to say hello  to us by our names (except the newbies of course but they get it eventually). Recently we have been going through a lot with my 13 year old son. Tracy, a pharmacist has really gone out of her way to help us understand what is going on with the medications and it illness, more so then the doctors have. I think without her I would still be lost. Thank you all for being so great and taking the time out of your busy days to even say hello. Sheri B
5	Cool staff, very clean and well run. I've had a good experience anytime I've been here so no complaints from me. Just wish they carried liquor. On the other hand, no worried cuz I can just go to Luke AFB and get all the liquor I want, tax free and 24 hours a day!
