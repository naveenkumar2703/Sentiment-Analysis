2	I went to JL Nails on the recommendation of a neighbor. On my initial visit I went in for a mani-pedi, my treat to myself for Mother's Day. The staff was (is) extremely friendly but the place is a mess. The pedicure was better than I've had in a while and my nails looked pretty. I went in today to get my eyebrows waxed because it's closer than the salon I usually go to and I was in a bit of a hurry. When I went to lay down the towel covering the headrest was dirty and had hair on it. Then,  when she handed me the mirror to check out my brows I couldn't see through the grime. I was really disappointed. I don't need a place to have a ritzy salon atmosphere but it does need to be clean. It's too bad, I would have loved to have a salon this close to my house.

2	If you have the manager do your nails, you will love them.  ANYONE else and you will get a horrible job and an attitude.  The last time I went there my nails had problems within a day and when I tried to talk to the technician about it she blew me off and walked away.  I was extra mad because I had been so worried about hurting her feelings when I first walked in to talk to her about it, and she was so rude despite me being super nice about my nails looking like crap within a day of getting them done.  Haven't been back since then.
2	Came here to get a wax and noticed that she did not use a new wooden stick on my face. Yuck. Won't be back. Must be clean above all else
