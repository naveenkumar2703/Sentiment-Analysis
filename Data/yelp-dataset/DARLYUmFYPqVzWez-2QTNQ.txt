4	Great service, clean, and fair prices. I have been using this salon for close to 6 years and the staff are all very good at manicures and pedicures. I haven't had waxing done at this salon so I can't comment on that. But if you want a good pedicure, manicure, fill, or gel nails, this salon is one of the better salons in Mesa.
5	The place is beautiful, wonderful staff for comparable prices.  I've been going since I moved here from Atlanta almost 2 years ago and I'm thrilled!
5	Best set of gell nails I have ever gotten.  Very clean and professional.  Will be back
4	Very nice location close to Las Sendas.  The staff was very friendly.  Joseph did my nails and he was very nice and professional.  They were a little pricey but the place is clean and I really like my nails.  I got a mani/pedi.  I would definitely come back.  My only complaint is that they do not have the staff to have one person doing your pedi while another person works on your hands.  I'm a mama with little ones and my free time is precious.  I ended up spending more time there than I would have liked but they were very nice.
4	I just tried Ultra Nails for the first time in a longtime and I was pleasantly surprised.  I tried them about 4 years ago and was not happy.  But with any business give them time and most will change.   The nail tech was very personable and did a nice job.  I am a disgruntled client from Happy Feet, although I loved my nail tech I did not like the owners especially since they expanded.
5	Very nice place.  I had a pedi and gel manicure here, it took about two hours start to finish and that's with having my nails done at the same time so make sure you have enough time.  A lot of pampering and it is worth it.  It is very clean inside and does not have a offensive chemical odor like other places.  They do a great job and will do special designs on your toes or fingers if you request it.
