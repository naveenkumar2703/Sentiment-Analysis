5	This place is great the only pizza place we ate when i lived in AZ love the garlic crust. I wish they will deliver to CA. The wings are also great
1	3 of the 5 times we've ordered here they've given us the wrong pizza. Even at the sale price of $5, it is not worth it. I'd rather pay a bit more and get better tasting pizza that is actually what I ordered.
2	The pizza is great. The service is not great and they were slow took over an hour, got the order wrong said they would send us another in 40 mins.......
2	Their pizza is great! ...when it's not late, cold, and wrong.Our order took two hours to get to us, with no explanation or apology. We discovered our pizza was thin crust - not what I ordered - and stone cold. I am just glad I ordered through GrubHub, who gave me a $10 coupon to make up for it.Not worth it! Until I see better reviews, I'll order elsewhere.
3	For me, it seems as if Hungry Howie's had a bright future filled with fame and fortune, but some time along the way, they lost their charm (and their $5 pizza). I feel as if the place in on the steady decline.Went in there and ordered two medium pizza's. There seemed to be a lone gal working and the poor thing was running around like crazy. However, she did a great job; my pizza was to me in the 10 min. she allotted when ordered. The pizza's were comparable to Little Caesars, which is a shame given that I used to greatly prefer Hungry Howie's.  One thing that really bothered me was this horrid noise coming from one of the many antique looking machinery in the back. Not sure what it was, but I feel for the employee's working there and would not be surprised if some became prone to seizures or something due to prolonged exposure. It was sooo loud!
