4	This is the perfect spot for someone looking just to be able to get your daily workout in without being in a crowded standard gym. they have all the basics you need.. in my book has everything i need, nothing more nothing less. Small, not crowded, 24/7 access even on holidays. only downside is there  are no showers, so just make sure you give yourself time to get home and shower if you need to be somewhere after your workout. ( would have gave 5 stars if had showers)Also which is nice is you can watch what you want on one of the t.v's, compared to other gyms where your forced to watch what they put on.  Also you have the option to pay month to month which is AWESOME since a contract with a gym is like  a marriage, so you def do not feel trapped with this place.  Cant beat low prices. glad i found this place and glad its a low key kind of place since workout time for me is exactly that and not social hour.YAY for snap fitness!
4	This is a great facility, with clean and new equipment that's well maintained. The website is excellent, and the staff were easy going. There was no push for a sale, and we were able to walk around and ended up enrolling right away. Got a smoking deal for $50 down and $25 / month and August (8/2011) for free after making a 12-month agreement, so be sure to ask what the specials are when you go in or call.
5	This is a perfect gym for me- open 24 hours(and holidays!), great staff, not too fussy, and clean.  I've been going there for two years and though it is small, it's never been too packed to get my full workout in.
5	Sadly I moved and don't go here but, this gym is great. Good price and lots of equipment. But, its small and never too crowded. Open 24 hrs so you can work out whenever.
