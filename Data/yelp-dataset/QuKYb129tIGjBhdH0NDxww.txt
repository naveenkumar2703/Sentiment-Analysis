4	Pretty small farmer's market, but it's a good option if you want local produce and farm fresh eggs.  There were 2 stands of vegetables, some crafts booths, and some local products in jars (Honey, jams, marinated and pickled vegetables).  I was excited that one of the stands had farm fresh eggs for sale!  I also picked up some really nice, fresh vegetables for the week.  For those that don't live very close to the larger farmer's markets (Like the Phoenix Public Market), this is a more convenient choice if you live in Tempe.
