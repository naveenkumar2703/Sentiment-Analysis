4	Day 032/365Yelp Challenge 2011I gave this outlet store location four stars for their return policy!  A few months ago, I received a three piece re-gifted gift, tags attached, unused by the previous owner.  Our Crabtree and Evelyn store had shut down some time ago at Ala Moana and I was unable to return it in Hawaii.  I emailed the main customer service address on the Crabtree and Evelyn website and explained my situation to them.  I promptly received a reply email from them, to return the items to the closest location to my home for a merchandise exchange.When I arrived at the outlet mall (112 degrees outside), I explained to the store sales associate my situation.  She scanned the three items and gave me the full original price value!  I was expecting a much decreased current store value.  All I had to show was a current ID for the transaction.I left with a shopping bag filled with new items that I could use or give away for Christmas gifts.  The only items that they lacked were baby gifts, I was told they were discontinued some time ago.

The friendly Deon helped us out while looking for some last minute christmas gifts. Procrastinating never helps, I don't know why I never learn, i will eventually, I hope.  Anyways, I had a few questions on why this soap was so much better than others and Deon was all over the opportunity to school this, uneducated soap shopper. He was like a soap sommelier, he was on point! When someone knows so much about soap and they are able to enlighten you about why you should know more, you're instantly hooked. He did his store proud. We walked out with great products and a good understanding of triple milled soap. Thanks Deon.
