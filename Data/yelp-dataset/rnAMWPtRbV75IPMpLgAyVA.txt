5	I do enjoy coming to this banking center. There is a friendly staff and the lines are usually not too long. I prefer using the drive-thru ATMs, because this bank has them updated to deposit cash and checks, with no envelopes! I've never had a bad experience here!
3	I usually only uses drive-thru to do deposits and payments.  Sometimes there's only 1 person working the drive-thru windows, so it takes a long time doing my transactions.  Wish they would change that so I won't have to take my money elsewhere.
1	Never using Bank of America again. Hidden fees everywhere, unable to make a credit card payment through the website, and then when I close my account I've gotten a new notice every month that I owe money from some fee. I've gone in to ask a banker for the last two months how to stop these fees and they tell me that it is closed and not to worry about it. Then the next month there are more. Still really have no idea how to stop these $32 payments from coming in every month for an account I closed in March. Also, bankers who are unable to answer basic questions. I asked how to receive my rewards points and they said that I can't get rewards points on Credit Cards. Then when I close my account I was told that I lost the $150 worth of rewards I had on the Credit Card. It's not even the money that's coming from them, but the time and effort it's taking to get them out of my life. It's like a bad ex girlfriend ;)
