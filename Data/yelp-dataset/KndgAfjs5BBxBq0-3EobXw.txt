4	I went for breakfast with a friend.  YUM!!  I had the most delicous breakfast burrito.  The potatoes are as yummy as they come.  We used an entertainment coupon for buy one get one but it would have been cheap even without it.  I can't wait to go back.
5	Sunrise Cafe is my FAVORITE breakfast place! the ONLY thing I can complain about is, its only open till 3. I have been coming here for years even back when it was still called Theo's. The food is always awesome and very inexpensive GREAT service! The owner Andre is one the friendliest guys who makes sure your every visit is nothing my excellent. Oh and did i mention their gyros? best in the State!
4	Traditional homestyle diners with valley girl waitresses like this place are hard to come by these days. The food is great if you're looking for a simple brunch meal, and the service is quaint, and worth the price.
