5	Nice place. Kind folks here. Samantha checked me in and out. She was kind enough to discount my overage in my miles (I was off by 28 miles). Normally it's $0.74/mile but she lowered it to $0.63. I also used the discount I received when changing my address to buy the truck rental.  It was for 25% off. My total with fees and my overage was $79.74. Still cheaper than U-haul. Oh, but their 10 foot truck doesn't come with a ramp.
1	Returned a small moving truck to this location. I told them I was charged full 4 days "flatrate" even if my reservation confirmation only states 3 days. They don't care if I showed them my reservation confirmation. I only used the truck for less than 3 days for my move & they won't prorate! They wanted the fuel exactly on the "F"(full) even if we were explaining to them that we filled it up until the gaspump stopped just a few minutes ago. "We could do this all day, but it still won't go to F" annoyingly says the lady. We went to overfill the truck so I won't get charged another $30 for the gas. They have Bad customer service & they overcharge. Won't be using Budget anymore!
1	Attempted to return our truck here. The owner or lady at the desk was so RUDE. She appeared annoyed the instant we walked in. Wouldn't accept our truck without ALL paperwork. Come to find out after calling budget, she could've looked up our info on the computer. Lazy and rude. The customer service rep called her, she wouldn't answer so they left her a message. When we returned the second time she was on the phone arguing with customer service about us. We told her we would just return the truck to a corporate office. She then stated "fine!" and threw the keys at us. YIKES. Not only will I not be using budget, I won't be using this place for storage either. Attitude adjustment ma'am.
