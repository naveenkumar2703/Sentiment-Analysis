1	I was flabbergasted to see that many bus operators can work in the same city at the same time, from the same bus stops, doing similar routes!! First costs the same as Lothian, but didn't seem to be on time, go where we needed it to go, or even run at all at the time we needed to take it!! (8pm towards a main train station!!) All in all seriously bad service. I'd recommend avoiding these buses, to better enjoy your visit.
