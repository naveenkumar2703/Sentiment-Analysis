4	Nice clean place, though smallish, wish they'd muffle the bouncy castle fans.
1	Birthday Parties, not again! My kids loved coming to the play fort to play, although over priced and small, it was the closest place to play indoors. I decided to have my son's 3rd birthday here. Not only were the doors closed when I came to set up, but no one answered their phone and they did not show up to open the doors until 5 minutes before my party started. My guests were walking in the door as I was still setting up. I never got an apology, rather a remark of "you still had time". I have talked to other parents who have said the same thing...ok place to play but birthdays, not so much!
5	The first Saturday of every month is PARENTS NIGHT OUT, from 6pm to 10pm. At $15 for 4 hours of babysitting, it's the best deal in town. We had our son's birthday party here and he had a blast. Twice the # of children who we expected came, and since these places typically charge penalties for added children you can see how that would add up. These prices were established on their website, and our problem was with the inconsiderate parents who brought their entire families to play or did not RSVP, not with the establishment.  Since they have a limited and allotted time for each party, I didn't mind their methods of wrapping up the party. I didn't want to infringe on another party's time and I was aware of the time we had (2 hours TOTAL).I really like the owners, I appreciate them not being afraid to scold my child if he needs it. He is quite the handful and they've always been able to take care of him during parents night out. They have a TV area if you decide to drop in and play. Take advantage of this place for date night and/or getting children activities in during our hot summers. Support our small businesses.
