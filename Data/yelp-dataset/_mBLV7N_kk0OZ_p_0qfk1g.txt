5	I love QT. When I was on my mission in Spokane I always wished I could have a slushy or some other beverage but I always had to wait till I got home. Now I go all the time. They complete transactions lightning quick and have what I need. Every store has always been great in my experience. My only wish now is that they sold diesel.
5	I LOVE this place! I'm always right in and out without long lines or any drama. They are always friendly and the store is always clean!
4	Nice, clean and friendly gas station. The gas price is reasonable for which the station is located. This might be a minor thing but I like is they have free air, which other gas stations charge for $1 just to put in air for your car. They also got good choices of snacks and drinks.
5	Always good costumer service and very clean. Plus their chocolate chip m&m cookies are delicious!!
