4	Nice, clean, neighborhood market. It's a bit on the expensive side for every day shopping, but a pretty decent place to pick up a few items, or wine/beer/booze. Once in a while you get some decent specials on meat, fruit & produce. Very friendly staff, place has a good vibe to it. Skip the brick oven pizzas, nothing to write home about.
4	I like this Basha's.... its local, and convenient. I don't think they are the cheapest place in town to shop... but it's around the corner from where I live.I also like supporting local Arizona business.The staff at this Basha's is always very friendly, and I like to frequent one store so you get to know the staff. They often run a $10 dinner "combo" package that is a really fair deal if you don't feel like cooking. You get to pick from different items and piece together a meal for $10. Not bad to feed a family of 4.
4	Really liked this Supermarket while visiting the area. Great private label selection and really tasty potato salad! Kind of a Whole Food feel!
3	I don't shop here often but the young man that rang my order was super friendly.  So nice that when I got home and realized I was overcharged for my beer, that it wasn't too much of a bother.
