1	Closed and blowed up.
3	Why am I doing a review for a closed casino that isn't even physically there anymore?  Hey why not? I can review anything I want huh.Stayed here July 2003 over the 4th of July weekend.  I think flight and 5 nights at the Ho for like 200 bucks.  Damn that was cheap now that I think about it.  There's a reason why it's cheap.  Westward Ho was pretty damn no frills.  It was an outdoor motel with actual physical keys and not that key card BS.  Inside the rooms where special containers where you can put your syringes.  Either they had a lot of smack addicts staying there or old folks who needed their diabetes shots.  I'll let you decide.The rooms were adequate and clean.  Nothing very fancy but I had no problem with it.  We also got free lunch at their eatery, another plus.Negatives here are that it's a pretty plain motel and casino and it was located in the shadier part of the strip near Circus Circus.  It was located next to a McDonalds so you had a lot of characters asking you for money. Sorry homie, I lost it all.My most vivid memory was smoking up with good ol Jeff R. and then getting the most incredible cottonmouth at night.  I literally couldn't take it anymore, ran outside to the vending machine and bought myself a $1.00 ginger ale.  I killed that damn soda in about 15 seconds...
5	Yes, it is true, they closed heaven, and it was the Westward Ho. I found this originally on my first trip here after turning 21, but I was still young and too stupid to know what I found. The next time I found the Westward Ho was on one night rampage through the city, and I was finally ready to appreciate what I had found. I won't try to describe the magic, as they are closed, but I will say that for those of you who have been: I mourn with you, and for those of you that never went: I forgive you.
