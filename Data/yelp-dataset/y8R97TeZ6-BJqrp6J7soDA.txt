5	Adam is one of the best, most honest biz owners around. Oh and did I mention he freaking ROCK when it comes to IT whether it's hardware OR software. He has fixed 3 of our laptops and would recommend him to anyone looking for a quick repair to a company looking for IT support with hundreds of employees. Thanks Adam!!!!
5	Adam and My PC Clinic are truly amazing.  My computer as running super SSSlLLOOOWWW. I tried all of the "remedies" I found online and nothing seemed to work.  Being that my computer is only a few years old I did not want to purchase another one. Took in in and a few days later I my computer was back to what I remember it when it was new.
5	Adam runs a great business with My PC Clinic! He truly cares about his customers and wants to ensure that they receive the best quality service. If you need your computer repaired - I definitely recommend My PC Clinic!
5	They are really great with customer service and they really know their stuff. When you take your computer in for whatever reason, they will explain exactly what they'll do, whatever the diagnosis is, without trying to upsell anything. I really appreciated what they did for me. Originally I went to have my old computer repaired because it was running slow. They advised me that they could build me a brand new computer with the old stuff from my old one, for a price even cheaper than what it would cost to actually repair the thing. I'm quite satisfied with the level of customer service and I highly recommend them.
