4	This Art-Deco building dominates the sky line of the southern Calton Hill area of Edinburgh. This gem of a building is now the home of the Scottish Government but the building was built upon an old prison, very appropriate some would say! With the coming of devolution to Scotland the building went under a major refurbishment in 2001 allowing the building to now house hundreds of civil servants. Having from the outside, this early twentieth century building has been pretty much left in its original state. St. Andrew's House is most defiantly a monolithic structure from looking at the building from the north (on Regent Road). However, when looking up at the building from the Scottish parliament, the building is, in contrast to its other side, has a much more layered structure, allowing it to stretch over Calton Hill. A building, defiantly worth taking a look at, from the south and the north!
4	St. Andrew's House contributes greatly to the experience of impressive buildings alongside those found on Calton Hill and Old Calton Cemetery this side of the city centre. It is particularly interesting for those with an interest in architecture.  Now I am not usually one of those people, but I know an interesting building when I see it, and this is one of those!  The scale and detail on the North facing side is outstanding. As usual with this type of building, I am amazed by the thought of how much effort went into its construction, particularly the attention to detail and patience necessary to carve some of the ornate decoration.It is quite interesting to compare this to the Scottish Parliament building down in Holyrood and to think how different attitudes and tastes in architecture have changed over the past 70 to 80 years. Truly amazing.  Well worth stopping and viewing on the way down from Calton Hill.
