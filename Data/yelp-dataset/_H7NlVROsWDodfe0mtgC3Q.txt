5	I have been going to Health coach's various clinics for 3 years  The medical staff and employees are very well educated and helpful.  I have been visiting the Chandler clinic for years with great success and recently went to the Phoenix clinic for a TMJ issue.  I was having serious jaw pain and within 4 visits my pain was completely gone.   I would highly recommend Health Coach for any of your chiropractic needs.
5	These guys know their stuff. I have sent several friends here over the years and they have all commented on the professionalism, sincerity, and the personal touch most larger offices lack. If you try Health Coach Chiropractic you will feel comfortable, get results, and save some money. (they are a locally owned office)
5	I was in an accident a few years ago and was told to see a chiropractor, which I was really hesitant to do. I was recommended to Health Coach and boy was it the best move I made. Their philosophy is to take a holistic approach to getting you healthy as quickly as possible. The staff is great and I felt comfortable putting my health in their hands.
5	How I'd survive without their expertise.  They are not only knowledgable and well educated in Chiropractic, but they are passionate about their craft. They are also a caring and compassionate who  cares about their patients.
