5	Being a regular at the Phoenix Public Market, I never miss a chance to stop by the Smart Cookie booth to say hello to the wonderful guys there and, if I'm not being too bad, sample a cookie or two. And they are incredible (the guys and their cookies!). They've positively redefined the chocolate chip cookie, but I love their "Heartthrob", a heart-shaped shortbread cookie half dipped in a chili-chocolate. It breaks my heart my diet keeps me from eating more of them. There are some good reasons to come down to the PPM, Smart Cookie is definitely one of them :D
5	Amazing!  If you like sweet , want organic products and the best ~ look no more!
5	Oh my! These cookies are fantastic. I brought them into work and everyone is my best friend now. The owners are super fantastic and have delivered for me on several occasions. I am so happy I found them through the Local First Arizona site. :)
5	We met these guys last weekend at the Downtown Phoenix market and they were delightful to talk to.  The cookies are super cute and we found out so yummy.  Everyone in our gang of friends bought one.  I give rave reviews for the overachiever!  Baked locally and even use Wei chocolate which is local and organic.  So head down to Central and Filmore area Saturday and check these guys out!
