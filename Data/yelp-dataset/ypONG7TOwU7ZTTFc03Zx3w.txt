5	Great location.  Very clean and really nice people.  Highly reccomend.
4	I've been to this location a few times.  They make good Sandwiches.  I get my usual 12" BMT on Italian Herbs & Cheese Bread w/Chips.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/subway-scottsdale-5?select=QAI_ng-kiM42p3cZc00P_Q#QAI_ng-kiM42p3cZc00P_Qhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/subway-scottsdale-5?select=iD67zwfhUijW1RZl4yFQVA#iD67zwfhUijW1RZl4yFQVAThe employees here are friendly and there's plenty of seating in the restaurant.  It's in my neighborhood, so I'll definitely be back.Return Factor - 80%
1	I often go to the subway with my children. Every time I eat there I get stomach issues. They are mishandling of their meats or something is just not right with the food. I am not going here again. I don't have this issue with other subway locations.
3	Not bad for a quick sandwich. My son seems to enjoy the roast beef with all the fixings he likes. I however, just stick to the meatball sub. A lot still looks too much processed meat for my likening...roast beef not so much as the others. The bread is typically fresh but I guess you have to hit it at the right time. Sometimes it's dry and hard. The place is clean and the staff has always been friendly. I gave 3 stars cause my kid likes the food he eats, the place is clean and staff is friendly. I would take more stars away when it comes to the deli. I wish they would jump on board like all the other shops and slice your meat fresh in front of the customer. SO much better taste vs. tasting something that looks like it came out of a Lunch-Able.
4	Not all Subway restaurant location on the same... But this one is very good. It's well-maintained and cleaning. And the stuff really take care of you and making your sandwich the way you want.Every time I go in here and I have a good experience... So if you're looking for a good sandwich and a little bit healthier way to eat. Then you can't go wrong with the subway.
