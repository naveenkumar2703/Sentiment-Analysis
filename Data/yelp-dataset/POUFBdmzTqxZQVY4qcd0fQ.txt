2	I'm not trying to defend this store or anything cause it is ghetto but I mean it's not always the store's/employee's fault. I mean, look at the neighborhood it's in...look at the people who shop at this specific Kmart...the answer is in itself right there. People let their kids run amuck pulling things off shelves, ruining things, not putting things back where they found them, damaging product and not paying for it...people are the REASON the store looks so sh!tty in the first place!So really ask yourself...are you SURE the store is ghetto...or is it just the PEOPLE??? Hmmm??????
1	Sometimes I go here for the heck of it. But when I do its a mess. Prices aren't even consistent with what they have on signs. There isnt much to choose from. But once in a great while I find myself stopping here just to see what I can find on clearance. Then I am out.
2	The Kmart on 43rd and Indian School has been closed for a long while now. That was our go-to store. They had decent stuff. I miss that snack bar so much. The nachos were amazing and I have yet to find any better nachos but I digress.This location is now the closest to us. It seems mostly like a ghost town. Very quiet and strange. No snack bar. Boo. They do have ICEE's but that means nothing when the machine is ALWAYS out of order. But I can see why since there seems to be minimal traffic here. As another Yelper said, the prices here are in shambles. Their loss, our gain. My mom got $1 pool filters and $1 kids pool due to false advertising and false labeling. Go here and it's not surprising to see why Kmarts will be a thing of the past. The service is lackluster and you can tell none of the employees want to be here. Kmart is one of the places that has ELF cosmetics but they are always out of stock of lots of them. Good thing Target also sells them too.For the most part a lof of items seem to be $1-4 more than others stores. Makes it not worth it to shop here except for the occasional laundry detergent sale.
