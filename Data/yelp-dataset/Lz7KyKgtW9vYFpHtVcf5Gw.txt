5	I come to this location for all my mailing needs and I'm never disappointed. It seems to be a family that owns Postal Connections and everyone there has been extremely nice and helpful - always try to give me options for mailing items and recommendations based on their experience and how much I'm willing to pay. They have just about any shipping supplies you need; envelopes, padded envelopes, boxes, bubble wrap, tape, etc. They also have copying services, faxing services, and PO Boxes on site.
5	It's tough to find top notch customer service. When I came here to mail a package, this is exactly what I got! It's easier for me to come here than going to USPS. Will definitely do business here again!
4	After dealing with the USPS, UPS and FEDEX at their various locations I was tired of poor customer service and their exorbitant pricing schemes. Postal Connections is friendly, and have every shipping option you might need. I really like the computer system that shows the price for every carrier, which allows you to pick what best suites your needs. I plan on using them for all my shipping needs in the future.
5	I've used this particular PC for both domestic and international shipping with absolutely no problems; I also go here regularly to have items faxed.  Without fail, the owners are friendly, helpful, and thorough; thanks to their thoroughness I was able to successfully dispute an item a particular business said they didn't receive via fax, which saved me time and money.
1	I used to come to this location for ALL my shipping, and fax needs. Today, I went in to copy a paper, and the guy (I'm guessing the owner) was absolutely rude when I had asked him to help me. Walking over rolling eyes, asking rude questions and all. I never thought I would experience such a horrible experience from this business.
