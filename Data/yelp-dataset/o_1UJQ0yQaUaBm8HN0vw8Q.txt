5	Outstanding service. needs a specific part , they greeted me at the from door and took me directly to the item in the store.  I don't know how many retailers could do this, but i was greatly impressed and the have won a fan...  Great Job...
5	We absolutely love having Dave's Ace Hardware open and close to us.  Although we have one of those "home improvement box stores" in the same area, Dave's Ace is always our first choice.  The employees are wonderful - helpful and friendly.  Their prices are good and merchandise quality is excellent.
5	Once again - 5* for our local hardware store!As I refuse to leave the house on Black Friday and today was Small Business Saturday, we ventured to Dave's Ace Hardware to do a small bit of shopping.  I had my heart set on a light up reindeer (yeah, that's a long story, don't ask) I'd seen advertised.  We couldn't find in stock but Gail was as helpful as always and told me I could buy it, and pay for it today (rather than a rain check to take advantage of the AmEx promo) and they'd place the order from the warehouse and call me on Wednesday to pick it up.As always, fantastic customer service - we are definitely customers who will keep coming back!
5	I love this store!  They always have everything I need.  Every time I go in there are a bunch of people working and looking to help me out and find whatever I need.  I choose this store over Home Depot any day.  No hunting around for an employee to help you out.  Plus, they give away free popcorn, you cant beat that!!
5	Always someone available to help! Staff seems eager to assist with any knowledge they have that can help
