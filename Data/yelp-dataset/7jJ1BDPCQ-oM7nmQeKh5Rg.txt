4	Pretty good place.  A few unique flavors like triple chocolate and birthday cake. A large selection of toppings.  Check them out if you're in the area.
4	Nice brand new Froyo shop around the corner from my place. Great selection of frozen yogurt flavors... but I really like the little LCD screens with the nutritional info for each flavor. You are welcome to taste each flavor.Large selection of fresh fruit toppings, as well as the assorted other decadent treats... gummy bears, sprinkles, and my fav... cheese cakes bits!Pricing is .45 per ounce... about the same as Yogurtology. Be careful how much you put into your cup!!! If you go crazy you will end up with a $12 yogurt sundae!! :)
3	A decent Frozen Yogurt place. Basically a clone of Yogurtology but the location is conveniently located near Basha's and CVS.
1	This place is no longer in business. Sad to see it go.
