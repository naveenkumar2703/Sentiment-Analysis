5	I have been going to Lindsey's Westgate Cleaners for over 10 years! I love the fact that I can come to pick up my clothes and they are already looking for my ticket and bringing my clothes up to the counter for me the minute I walk through the door. It feels great that they care enough to remember me, and we always seem to pick up our conversation from where we left off. It's rare that you get that personal touch from a business nowadays,  and the entire team at Lindsey's is top notch. They have gotten the worst of stains out of clothes that I never thought possible. I have been able to get clothes in one or in two days when I was in a pinch and forgot to drop them off sooner. I have also used them for small alterations for my clients' purchases. The work was excellent, and I would consistently get requests from clients who preferred me to take their clothing to Lindsey's.  The quality and customer service can not be beat! For exceptional quality and a thorough job I will recommend Lindsey's Wesgate Cleaners hands down!
5	I have been going to Lindseys now for 3 months and I have to say I had my leather jackets in bad shape and no one in SW side could help. I came in and they look brand new!!. I was so happy I thought they were gonners. Great job Sue + Tray I am happy knowing that for the price and quality, you guys are #1. You earned my business. anyone need leathers done either 1 color or multiple.. THIS IS THE PLACE!!! :)Gianno
2	How could anyone give this place 5 stars?  First I will say that they did a fine job with the suits that I brought in.  My main complaint is that they don't take any type of credit/debit card and they don't tell you that until you come to pick up your clothes.  Add to that the fact that the location is old and run down and the prices are a little on the high side.  Bottom line:  there are definitely better cleaners around.  I don't recommend this place.
