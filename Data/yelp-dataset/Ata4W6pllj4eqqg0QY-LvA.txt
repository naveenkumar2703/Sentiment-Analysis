5	This branch of Wells Fargo is my favorite.  For the most part because of a banker there named Morris Richie.  I have multilpe accounts and multiple questions.  Morris is so friendly and helpful it is unbelieveable.  No matter what banking problem I have, Morris solves it.  I feel like he is my friend rather than my banker.  When he was on vacation his manager (can not remember her name) helped me with notarizing something and she also was completely friendly and helpful.  I go out of my way to use this bank.
4	PROS: This WF bank is pretty good. It's basically as good as it gets. They provide most of the bank services here and have 1 ATM in the drive-thru! The employees are kind and respectful.CON: There is usually a line in the afternoons, especially on weekends. The area in which it is located is slowly becoming a shady place during the nighttime. Bank during the day, be safe, and protect your security by watching where you wave around your personal info :)PS every few months, that drive thru ATM breaks, but don't forget the one on the inside!
1	Worst Drive Thru ever!!! Only 2 customers, me and this guy up front. Been waiting for 30min, cant back out cus the armor truck is blocking to make a drop at the ATM machine. Smh
