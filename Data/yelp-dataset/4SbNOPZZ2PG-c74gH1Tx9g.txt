5	This is a very basic Mexican restaurant in one of the oldest strip malls in Goodyear. We have been going here for about 7 years now. It is one of those places one goes when one thinks about it. The food is almost always good, but has missed its mark a few times. In this miss it is usually because the food is just not warm enough. But this is not the norm. Working here one earns the money and it is done with a smile and efficiency. SO if you are ever in the neighborhood give them a try.
5	I love this place, food is great and so is the price. I dont know how many times i've stopped in here with friends after a heavy night of drinking to sober up. Hits the spot with the Carne Asada burritos!!
4	Love their breakfast burritos!! Haven't tried anything else there but very happy with the breakfast!!
3	MEH. This place is ok...but after having had Senor Tacos, I wouldn't ever go here again.  Do yourself a favor, drive a couple more blocks to Senor Taco
4	Been here several times for breakfast and lunch. Pretty good food. The setting on the inside seems a little cheap, but it is what it is. A simple little Mexican joint to get your Mexican food fill. If they only served beer! Lol
