1	Probably the worst restaurant that my spouse and I have ever eaten at. This place belongs on an episode of "Restaurant Impossible." I had the souvlaki - the pita was literally stale, and the rice dry and undercooked. My spouse had the mushroom Fettuccine Alfredo - I tasted it after she had no more than three bites. The dish tasted like undiluted Campbell Cream of Mushroom soup had been poured on top of overcooked pasta. Avoid, for the life of you. Your toilet will thank you.
4	Deserves respect for their breakfast. This place is clean and lots of space for a group. Give it a chance.
4	Ok so 4 stars might seem a bit enthusiastic for this place but hear me out. The restaurant itself is a poorly lit confusing mishmash of banquet hall, old school diner, and one of those dreadful places where old people get their liver and onions! HOWEVER....So far this place only rates 1 star, but if I posted that then the good part wouldn't get the attention it deserves:  stuck in the middle of this strange complex there is a small sports bar, nothing special on its own but OMG, they have the most fantastic wings in town! That in itself is what gets three more stars.
