3	Kind of a seedy little joint.  I walked in and almost slipped on the wet floor that had no wet floor sign.  Good thing I'm not the lawsuit kind of guy or I'd be on my back right now screaming " ooooouch. My back, my neck, my back and my neck! I want a hunned grand!! But I'll settle for a 40 oz. ".
3	Refill propane gas tank for 4.4 gallons at $19.23 so-so.
4	What can I say???It's a gas station. Nothing too fancy, lol...It's not the cheapest gas station and it's not the most expensive in town either!  It did however give me a problem taking my debit card at first but then it took it
2	I don't like any gas stations that have different prices for cash/debit/credit payments.  Why can't they all be equal?  Not coming here again.
