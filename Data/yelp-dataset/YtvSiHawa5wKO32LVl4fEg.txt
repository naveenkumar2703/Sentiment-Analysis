3	Very convenient. When I want to shop for groceries and consumables, and just do not want to deal with the busy supercenters, there are times that I patronize this store. I have noticed in the past that Neighborhood Markets up their prices. Maybe things are changing because the few items that I brought today (knorr rice, shampoo, Authentic Asia Tom Yum soup, and Bud Ice) are competitive with supercenters.   For beer drinkers, this Neighborhood Market sells 20-ounce beer. Unless things very recently changed, the American-Pacific and Locee Road stores did not sell them.  I was in and out of here in a few minutes.
4	This location is very convenient because I live close to it and it is open 24/7.  I work very late hours and sometimes I don't have time to go grocery shopping.  I prefer Fresh&Easy for groceries, but whenever I need to quickly grab milk or egg late at night, this Wal-mart is perfect.  The only thing about going 3 or 4am is that they are restocking during those hours and large stacks of food items might block your way to veggies or eggs.  So watch out for those. Other than that, I love how convenient this location is.
4	Cute as a bugs ear! Open 24/7 mostly a grocery store, and that's fine with me. Carry s most of the things I need when I am on this side of town. Never had to stand in a long line and it is quiet here, I like quiet..
5	The customer service at this store in particular, Ramona, has made me a loyal Wal-Mart shopper. I prefer this neighborhood store.I had major ankle reconstruction and was on a kneeling scooter for an extended period of time. Ramona and her team helped me regularly during that time and continue to do so today.I do not live near this store but travel there because of their outstanding team.Thank you Ramona - your compassionate care and good cheer is much appreciated!
3	I like this store. It's still pricier than I expected, but if I don't feel like going to WinCo this is the next best thing. It's clean and friendly.
