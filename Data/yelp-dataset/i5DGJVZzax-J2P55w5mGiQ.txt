5	I highly recommend Dog Gone It Mobile Pet Spa. Tina is very professional and does an exceptional job grooming both of my girls.  She has truly great skills and is able to make a special bond with all animals.  After having a spa day with Tina, they come out looking and smelling great and they are always happy.
5	I highly recommend Tina. My dog has been groomed by the same person for 9 years. She is an awesome groomer and loves my dog as if she's her own. She had to stop grooming so I started visiting groomers. I was so disappointed until I found Tina. She connected with my dog like my other groomer and made her look terrific. She followed all my directions and was so pleasant and spent so much time with her. She even came to visit her before her first grooming. I'm thrilled and relieved I found Tina!
5	We have been clients of Tina's for several years now. We tried other local groomers, both through chain pet stores and privately owned, without a whole lot of success.  Our poor shih-tzu Tatum came back terrorized and even injured from one experience.  This led to him not to trust groomers.  Tina worked with him and now our dogs love her.  Tina's mobile grooming service is professional, clean, and prompt. She is very skilled.  She listens in great detail to our needs and pays close attention to the well being of our dogs.  Tina has a great memory of what we liked in the past with an attention to detail.  She even remembers our dog's allergy to nylon collars.  I would highly recommend Tina and Dog Gone It Mobile Grooming Service to anyone.  The fact that I don't have drive all over town with our dogs is a definite bonus.  She is worth every penny.
