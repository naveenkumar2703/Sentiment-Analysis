3	Good product selection.  They didn't have the brand of hair that I use for braiding, hence 3 stars.
5	YES! YES! YES! Finally! I spy an African American beauty supply store! I walked in and said, "YES! I found you at last! I need my supplies. There are no beauty supply stores in Northern Arizona and beyond. You have no idea how deprived this Native American girl is!"Picked up my black soaps, lightening cream, sponges, hair do wrap, and pumice stone. Yay! I am happy now.
5	At first I was turned off by the name but one day I finally went inside and I must say I was happily surprised. They have TONS of hair, products, accessories, etc! The staff is always nice and the prices are pretty reasonable.
5	Great Store friendly staff.  Great that they are open early on Sunday . Great selection of items too.
