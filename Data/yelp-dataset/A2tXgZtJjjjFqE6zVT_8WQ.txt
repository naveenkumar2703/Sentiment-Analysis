3	New, and still slightly struggling with its identity, Cafe Nemrut offers some nice, simply prepared Turkish dishes (which we sampled), sitting alongside more standard British all-day breakfast fare. I'm not sure this is a completely sustainable approach, as surely one or the other is going to become the focus of customer interest. We shall see how the place develops.Overall, we said: "So Nemrut served us pretty nicely. At this stage, I'm not sure whether their custom is favouring the Turkish or British side of the menu, so it will be interesting to see how the emphasis of their menu develops. They have plans to run an evening menu focussing on Turkish seafood, so I'm certainly looking forward to that. For sure, it whet the appetite for my visit to Istanbul, next month."
3	One of the places I like to visit for breakfast or coffee with my friends. Today I got an interesting combination of scrambled eggs, Turkish salami (I hope it was), cheese, black and green olives on cucumber and tomato, white soft cheese, grilled baguette and Turkish tea. I agree that this place is lacking of identity however staff extremely friendly and overall experience very good. I will definitely be back for a quiet breakfast or lunch.
