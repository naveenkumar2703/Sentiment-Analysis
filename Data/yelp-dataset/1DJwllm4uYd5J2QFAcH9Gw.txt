4	I love the classic Catherine Malandrino dress, and if you're looking for a non-elaborate one, this is a great place for you to go. Dresses that are normally $425 are reduced to around $250. Still pricey, but a large discount. If I didn't already have one of her dresses, I would have gotten one. Awesome store!
4	WOW!!! They have a Catherine Malandrino Outlet!?! *Happy Sigh* *Unhappy Sigh because I still couldn't justify buying a dress and I couldn't lug it back...*
5	I love this store. Malandrino dresses are classics.  I love the bright colors and the weight of the fabrics. The stitching is impeccable and the prices are far less here than in a boutique or any department like store.  Some dresses are priced at 50+% off. That is amazing. I wish I had pictures of the showroom. The store seems so empty but really, everything is just kept so neat and clean. It's always a nice trip to the Malandrino shoppe.  The sales associate didn't talk much but I think part of the reason for that is that the dresses and other items just sell themselves. It really is about the name and the quality. You wouldn't be disappointed.
