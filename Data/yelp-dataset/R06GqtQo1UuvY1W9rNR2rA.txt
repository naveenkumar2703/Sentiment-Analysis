5	Unlike a good majority of women, I love me a trip to the auto parts store to pick up my filters and oil to do routine maintenance on my ride. Let's just say it's fun to chill out with either my Pops (former auto mechanic) or Dude  and learn a thing or two instead of throwing myself into the Den of Shady Bastards (auto shops) who loooooooooove taking advantage of the fact you're female! All the employees are extra helpful, so don't be shy: ask for help if you need it. Love that I can drop off dirty oil here! A little bit pricey, but the customer service here is superb . . . which is why I keep coming back.

When I walked in he had just moped and reminded me that the floor might be wet, which was good to know because I was wearing sandals which don't do well on slick wet surfaces.He helped me find the right oil I needed and has always given me good feedback on products I'm buying.
