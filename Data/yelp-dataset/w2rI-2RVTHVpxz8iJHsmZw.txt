5	Exceptionally friendly customer service and very good prices. Highly recommended.
4	A great cleaners who does everything onsite.  I think they are locally owned and are really nice people.  It's priced like all the others too.  No price gouging here!We get tired of the pre-paid crap owned by some Arab, that is sent out somewhere and is only a store front.  This one is definitely not one of those.
5	Prices are comparable but the service is unbeatable.  Great friendly people that really care about you and know how to provide a good customer experience.  Highly recommended.
1	Good prices until the owner decided not to  take ownership of his staff ruining 2 of my shirts. I was told something to the effect of "There is no way we could've put those stains on your shirts"... I guess it's an impossibility for dry cleaner to ruin shirts. His compromise was offering me a $20 credit, which would've covered 20% of the value of the shirts lost. I won't continue to play Russian roulette with my nice clothing... I'd advise you to do the same. The humorous part of the whole thing is I probably spent over $50 per month on dry cleaning... a savvy business person would've pulled my account, realized the value of a good customer, and done the right thing.
2	I have been using them a year now.  Since the summer the service has changed.  Yes you get your clothes dry cleaned onsite but the staff is rude.  You should know the owner also owns vista cleaners where the lady who does the alterations is located.  Again work is good but prices are shady.  They are not consistent with their pricing.  She can be very rude.  She will tell you how great she is and people travel from Scottsdale just for her, but she forgets she is in customer service and it should be about customer not her.
