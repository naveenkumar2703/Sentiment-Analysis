4	This movie theater is smaller and older. That can be either a bad thing or a good thing depending on what you want in a theater experience.You're not going to get reclining chairs and stadium seating. Sometimes the staff are neglectful. The popcorn might be stale. But if you want a theater all to yourself, this is your place. Tucked away behind MCC and Fiesta Mall, it seems as if people have almost forgotten this place is here. You can see a movie without fighting for a parking place or being overrun with rowdy teenagers.
2	This is not a place I would take my wife and child. Yes, it is old and I guess that is what you could call part of it's ''charm'', but the theatre is not that well maintained. It's dark and creepy, and the staff is usually highschoolers which is normally fine, but when they are unsupervised it just means lazy service.
4	When new movies come out this is the place to go. As others have said, it is small, it is old, but it is quiet and a little cheaper than the bigger theatres.  Being married with no kids it is a great place to go for a movie.
3	This theatre is closed.
