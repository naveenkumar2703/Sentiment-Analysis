4	This little beauty supply store is great and cheap.  I usually just buy my hair dye here and it's only about $4.00.  I bought the  Sally's card too for $5.00 a year which isn't too bad cause you're given some coupons as well as discounts.
1	This store was close which is the only reason I ever went.  Thank goodness I recently moved and there is one closer with a much better staff.  However, this one....avoid if you can.  The staff is RUDE and like to chatter when there are customers in the store instead of helping them.  I lived down the street for five years so this isn't just a one time experience.  It happened almost every time.  The last few months there was one young girl (I can't remember her name, started with an A) that worked there that was super nice and sweet, they better keep her or they will keep getting bad reviews.
3	I need some emergency hair for NYE and this is the place to be! I walked in and immediately found what I was looking for, the sales associate helped me match my hair, offered me their beauty club rewards program, which cost me $5 but saved me $10 with a $5 off coupon for a future purchase so it ended up being worth it. Plus the hair looked FABULOUS on me and that's what REALLY matters, right?!
