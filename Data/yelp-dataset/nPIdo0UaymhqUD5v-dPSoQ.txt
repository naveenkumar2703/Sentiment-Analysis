5	Beautiful church. Friendly people.
5	I love this church!   Coming here has seriously strengthened my faith and kept me regular about going to Mass.  They preach true Christian values here-- Love, Forgiveness, Peace.  They always preach the gospel in a positive way, often with humor and in such a light that I really see how it is relevant in my life. Since becoming a parishioner here, for the first time in my life, I actually look forward to going to Church instead of just feeling like I really "should".  The music is decent too. They keep it fairly upbeat without trying to sound like a Christian rock band like some in the area do.  Oh, and my older child loves going to Liturgy of the Word for children-- a sort of Children's Mass/Sunday school that takes place while the parents are in Mass on Sunday.   Can't say enough good about this place!
4	I came here this past weekend to witness a friend of mine receive her 1st Holy Communion and to be welcomed in to the Catholic Church during her RCIA process.  The church is quite big and very beautiful.
