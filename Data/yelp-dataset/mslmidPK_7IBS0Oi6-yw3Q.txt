5	The auto repair is open 7 days a week, and they have been completely honest and up front with me with any repairs I have had done at their location.I have never once felt like I was being cheated or taken advantage of, and I will definitely return to Boulder Basic Sinclair whenever I may need a repair.
3	This gas station is near my gym so I stop in to gas up and get a drink from time to time. There aren't many gas pumps, and the card readers for the gas pumps are always out of order. The people that work there are nice and friendly at least!
1	I had my vehicle here for brake pads replacement and it took them literally 4 hours to get it done! It's like they completely put their priority on my vehicle down the bottom of their list. They also charge me an hour worth of labor just for replacing pads. They filled the brake fluids to the point where shit was spilling all over the compartment. These guys are sloppy and crooks. Look somewhere else.
