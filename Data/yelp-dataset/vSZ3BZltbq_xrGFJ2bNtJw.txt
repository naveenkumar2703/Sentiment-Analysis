5	So I have been getting my lashes done for about 6 months and I recently moved to Vegas. That being said I had to find a new lash chick and she by far is the best, even better than the girl I had in AZ.
5	Lindelle is a talented aesthetician! She offers a full range of waxing services, relaxing facials, soothing massages and makeup and eyelash extensions. And she does all if this with the beautiful aloha spirit and at very reasonable prices! Lokahi is a beauty and relaxation oasis!
5	Lindelle did my lashes the other day and I can say with confidence that I LOVED them! They turned out fuller and better looking than I could remember before.  She's efficient with her time and very friendly.  To top it off, she's more affordable than a certain chain in town I've been going to, but with better quality work.  I've gotten a lot of compliments since our session and will definitely be coming back :) Thanks, Lindelle!!
