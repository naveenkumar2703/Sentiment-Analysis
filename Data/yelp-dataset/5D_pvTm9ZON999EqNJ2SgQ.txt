5	The new manager here is simply amazing. I believe her name is Libertie. I came in to exchange a pair of shoes and she was all smiles when it came to helping me. I usually hate shopping but to be honest I actually look forward being able to go back for my next pair of shoes. Without a doubt this is a place to stop by if you are in Town Square and need a pair of shoes. High quality and low price... add the insanely kind service of Libertie and it's a definite.
5	Manager named India. She was the sweetest and most helpful manager I have yet encountered in retail. The location in fashion show mall has a bit of a snottier staff. Townsquare location: they are just the nicest people. (I had a few issues on a refund that I hadn't received in 15 days and right when I got on the phone she had taken control if the problem)
