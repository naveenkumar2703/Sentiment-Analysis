4	There is an entire section in this utterly cute and cool store for giving and sharing art supplies.  Now, while I feel as though I left behind most of my hippie tendencies when I graduated from high school, I can't help but love the fact that the folks who own this place like making crafty stuff from scratch and are proud of their funky roots.  I'm coming back.
5	great little shop! wonderful staff, and the owner is just a doll.she has weekly "make and takes" where you can go in and make your own bits of useable art (topics for each week are posted on her facebook page or website: http://glitterworkshop.com/dish/tuesday-make-take).fun atmosphere and full of handmade goodness! :D
4	This shop has become a favorite of mine! There are so many unique and beautiful things to wear, give, and decorate your home. I always go in with the intention of buying a gift, and I undoubtedly buy for myself! Also, the owner helped me put together the best birthday party for my 5 year old daughter.
