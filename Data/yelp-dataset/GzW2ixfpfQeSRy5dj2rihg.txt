4	Brian and his company just completed remodeling our kitchen and they did a fantastic job!  We had good solid cabinets, raised panel oak 42" , so we were not looking to replace them but wanted to have them refinished for a new look.  He had done 3 jobs for my clients prior to them putting their homes on the market so I knew that he did excellent work. We had the kitchen, wetbar area, 3rd bath and hall cabinets redone and hardware installed.  They offered us many choices with the stain, and they also added 4" crown and an 1"undermount moulding.  The job took about a week, the crew was on time and they cleaned up and once it was finished it looked like a brand new kitchen.  We went with a darker stain so the cabinets don't appear as an oak cabinet.  We LOVE our kitchen and would highly recommend them to anyone considering this type of project!
3	Great job done as far as the quality of the refinishing of the cabinets. However when they installed the new hinges they used 1/4" screws. I had to replace every screw on every hing in my house as the doors started to fall off. Like I said though, very good quality on refinishing.

Just not real wood, thermofoil. (sp?)  Anyhow, by the time they finished with them, and my adding of better knobs, they look great. I'd certainly recommend them.
5	Desert Cabinet Refinishing just finished doing the cabinets for our house. They did a great job - thanks to Brian and Jody and their team of professional refinishers. They made my cabinets look like they are brand new. They were on time and very neat, cleaned up afterwards and were very careful around my new tile and new countertops. Highly recommend them to anyone looking to refinish their cabinets.
