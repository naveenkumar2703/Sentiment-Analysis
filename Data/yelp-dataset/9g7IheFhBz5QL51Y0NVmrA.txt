4	The Chuparosa Park and Spray Pad is located at Dobson Rd. south of Germann Rd.. The best thing about the park is the spray pad. If you don't know what that is, it's a public area (usually in a park) where spraying and shooting water comes out of the ground and/or a variety of other elements. Here, the water shoots from four large rings kids can run through and one candy cane-shaped shower, as well as from the in-ground pad. The park also has a traditional playground, bathrooms and covered picnic areas.
4	Chuparosa Park's entrance is on Dobson Road between Germann and Queen Creek Rd, about 5 minutes from the QC Rd exit to I-10, and from the 101 exit Price Rd south.This is a popular park for birthday parties, group picnics and school field trip lunch stops. There are several large ramadas with picnic benches and grills that can be reserved. Other features are bathrooms, splash pad (hours vary with the season) sandbox, swings, and large play structure that was canopied in  2008. Close to the ramadas are large grass areas good for group games and setting up bounce houses.
4	This will be a popular destination of ours as the weather heats up. My daughter loves playing in the water rings at this place.
