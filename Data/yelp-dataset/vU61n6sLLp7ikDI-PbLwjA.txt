1	No bathroom, uhhh what kind of gas station is this but however there are two redboxes.
2	This one is located in a not-so-great area of town. Also, hard to get in and out of because of its location...19th Avenue...lightrail construction will be going on there for at least another year and a half and the whole place looks discombobulated. Very shady characters hang around that area, so please be careful there!
