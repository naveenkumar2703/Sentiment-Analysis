5	I recently had all of my carpeting and tile cleaned by 702 Carpet Cleaning and they did a fantastic job! Alex, the person who did the cleaning, was very professional, thorough and extremely careful with my furniture, tables, etc. I have lived in my current house for 3 years, and had the carpets cleaned twice before by different people. This time was the best by far! I had never had the tile professionally cleaned before, and it looks amazing now! About an hour after the job was done the home office called to see how they did. I told them that I was very pleased.
5	I've always had my carpets done by Sears but 702 Carpet Cleaning was by far the best. Alex did a wonderful job. I had my carpets cleaned upstairs and my tiles cleaned and grouted downstairs. Alex was in and out within 3 hours. He was pleasant, professional and it was a pleasure dealing with this company. A++++++
