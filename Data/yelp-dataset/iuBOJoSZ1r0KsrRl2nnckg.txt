5	This is hands down the best instruction in the cleanest environment. My entire family participates in several classes offered here. Moses is the finest tumbling instructor possible and his kettle bell classes are phenomenal. Quinn provides top notch ballet, jazz and tap instruction. Beyond their tremendous skill and knowledge, they are the friendliest and most thoughtful people and business owners you could hope to encounter. On my baby's first day of ballet Quinn quickly ran in the back and sewed up her new ballet shoes. Moses often stays late and let's my oldest daughter's tumbling class run long just to provide encouragement and to keep trying. You would think amazing and selfless instruction such as this would cost a small fortune, the prices are so reasonable and they do it for the love of it. Their passion inspires others and that's priceless to me. The facility is beautiful and well kept. I would give more stars if possible!!!!!!!
5	My teen daughter has been taking classes with The Center for a while now. Her technique has improved drastically from the time she took her first class. The instructors are the best of the best, or you would not have professional dancers from The Strip taking classes there themselves. Now, I am enrolling more of my children there, so they can also learn dance technique and have fun at the same time!! Keep it up Rock Center!!
5	My niece loves dancing here.She's danced at Kwok (spelling?) and at another dance studio in Anthem. And,by far, likes it here better.
5	Clean and  friendly.  My daughter loves her teacher and wants to continue taking dance lessons. Reasonable prices too.
