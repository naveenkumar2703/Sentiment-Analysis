4	Lovely little spot to get some good eats! As the name implies, all of the items are packed and ready to take away, however there is also a small bar with a few stools if you'd like to eat in or sip on a coffee right there. The menu has different features appearing on a weekly basis and this week the quinoa salad was delectable. I'm definitely going back again very soon.
3	If you're looking for a quick but good sandwich or salad, then this is the place. A little pricier than other downtown options, but worth it for the better quality. The staff seemed nice though I only talk with them for a couple of minutes (probably 2 min more than most customers). Newly opened, so ambience is a little spartan. Grab something and head out again, don't plan on eating there.
