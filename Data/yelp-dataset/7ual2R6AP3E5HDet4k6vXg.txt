4	Busy location on the Strip-  with McDonald's, Panda Express, and small convenience mart (strip mall across from Mandalay Bay casino). If you are in a rush, especially during lunch time, you should call the order in and pick it up. Parking in front and back, for your convenience. Serves breakfast and salads besides sandwiches, sides, & drinks. Also does catering- sandwich platters (serves 5-9) and giant subs (3 ft./ 6 ft.).(1) Choose type (footlong/ 6" sandwich/salad/flatbread). (2) Choose type of bread (9 grain wheat/9 grain honey oat/italian/italian herb & cheese/flatbread). (3) Choose your cheese (american/monterey cheddar). (4) Choose your veggies (lettuce/tomatoes/cucumbers/peppers/red onions/pickles/olives/banana peppers/jalapenos. (my favorite part) (5) Choose your sauce (fat free- mustard/honey mustard/sweet onion/red wine vinegar/mustard- full flavor- light mayo/chipotle southwest/ranch/mayo/oil. (6) Make it a meal- choose your drink and side.When you walk in, you smell the fresh baked bread- my husband loves that smell. I usually get the ham or the turkey footlong and sometimes the ham and turkey combo on wheat, with white cheese, mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, jalapenos, banana peppers, olives- I love that there are so many veggie options (that's what edges out portasubs). And healthier options as well- sandwiches and dressing. Plus, this popular sandwich chain is the originator of the "5 Dollar Footlongs." Sometimes there is baked lays potato chips. If you get the oil on your sandwich, it makes it soggy and eating a soggy sandwich is pretty messy (the sandwich just sticks to the roof of your mouth- yuck, hate that) and gross- drippy, gets all over your fingers. I like to eat half and save half for another meal (my normal routine). This one is close to work and is pretty busy at lunch time, so I recommend calling in your order if you're in the area. Once I ordered about ten sandwiches for a big meeting here and the large order (under $100) was ready for me to pick up, complete with condiments and napkins- really good service. Glad that I called it in, because the line was pretty long- about 8 people. And some of the seats were occupied so I'm sure that it would've been a packed house if the people in line were also eating there.
4	Good breakfast sandwich.Nice and toasted.
2	The placement is primo! Right next to Mandalay Bay. The service is alright and the food is typical Subway.
