3	I used Lori for my wedding flowers.  They were absolutely gorgeous.  She was easy to work with although we had some issues with emailing.
2	Horrible. Missed Delivery. TWICE. IMPOSSIBLE to actually GET a note to delivery person, the operators simply write it down and it never gets acted on. They are pretty good at saying "i'm sorry" and DID give me half my money back after 2 missed deliveries and 6 phone calls to try to get them to surprise a friend at work.  I ended up having to call her for an address she would be at between 8-5...blah...blah ...blah... thanks for facilitating the romantic gesture, corporate weasels.
1	If a ZERO star was possible this is what they deserve. My boyfriend tried to surprise me on Valentine's Day with a delivery to my work since he was home sick and couldn't bring them himself. By 5 pm the office closed and I had received nothing. He received an email "confirmation" for delivery at 7 pm. That is impossible because the doors are obviously locked at 5. We tried calling the customer service line that day earlier in the afternoon but their automated machine said "all florists are too busy to answer your call". When he called the next day to get a hold of a real person they promised a re delivery the next day to our home instead. Again, NOTHING showed. Now it's Tuesday and when I finally got a hold of a person to get a credit issued they won't do it because I wasn't the one who placed the order. Never mind it was paid for by OUR joint bank account.
1	Woul not recommend to order at all. Ordered a $55 bouquet and they delivered a sad 6 flower "bouquet". I attach a picture that will not lie. I could have bought something much better at safeway. Very disappointed. Wish I had read the reviews before ordering
