4	I loved this festival.We were driving back from Hoover dam and got a little lost LOL. And I am so glad we did because thanks to that we ended up in this place. So we parked and walked to the festival, I got to try a few BBQ's and they were good, nothing mind blowing but they were good, I also had, for the fist time, a Texas tornado there. Do not ask me what it is because frankly I'm not sure. It is a drink with lemon, orange and lime, with some red liquid. Hey I did my best to describe it.I got a chance to talk with a few people and vendors about the festival, mostly because I had no idea where were we. And everybody was really nice and cool.They also had an antique car competition or exhibition that I enjoyed a lot. Some really cool pick up trucks and antique cars.The town itself is pretty cool. If you get a change and want to try something different than the noise in Vegas by all means come here.The weather was perfect for a festival like this. Hot but not overwhelming. Really enjoyed this festival.

It would be awsome if they offered bites,  like a slider, so you could try it all. Spent the rest of the day at The Coffee Cup. I absolutely adore BC, and I will be back, next year, for some more Dam BBQ.
