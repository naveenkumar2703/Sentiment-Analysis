2	I love CJ's, some of the better quality fast food around, but this place is AWFUL. Always out of apple slices, and half the staff INSISTS there is no such thing as a large order of onion rings. I am consistently dissatisfied here, but unless I feel like driving all the way to Fiesta Mall I'm stuck going here. I'm giving it 2 stars because even though the people that work here are dumb as bricks, they are usually really friendly.
4	It's nice to see more establishments offering discounts to Veterans.  Thanks for the tax break, Carl's Jr.!
2	Every time I have been here the food seems old and dried out. Customer service is also a big problem! I went through the drive-thru and the guy barely said two words to me. Just took my money and threw my food at me.
4	I'm not a Veteran, but I have many friends and relatives who are and I'm impressed that this Carl's Jr offers a 10% discount for Veterans.  Kudos to you!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/carls-jr-mesa-5?select=ZXU23wTKWNZXIhRQBWvl5Q#_BTgsNqBHYLsmy1nCl058wThe food here is average.  I stopped by for lunch and ordered a Big Carl ($4.49) and a Western Bacon Cheeseburger ($3.99).http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/carls-jr-mesa-5?select=ZXU23wTKWNZXIhRQBWvl5Q#m-R_udfHbB3cRXaB_PZPMwIt's tastier than most of these fast food Burger joints, but it wasn't as good as other Carl's Jr locations I've been to.  The food gets 3 Stars and I've bumped it up to 4 Stars because of their Veteran's Discount....I think they deserve it for recognizing those who serve our country.Return Factor - 70%
1	I usually LOVE Carl's JR Chicken Tenders.   This place is awful.  The tenders are over cooked, they messed up my order  Iordered 20 Tenders for me and the kids. We got 10 pieces and they are awful.And their website is broken so I can't post an email to them either..... If I could do 0 stars right now. GRRRRRRRRRRRR
1	I went in there tonight and ordered a #1 SuperStar w/cheese combo, mentioned that I wouldn't mind the wait if they could cook my meal fresh. I received just the opposite a cold burger and old fries ... I was in a rush so I ate the horrible meal as is and left disappointed.
