5	Went to this location over the weekend to learn how to maintain my pool, since my pool guy decided to start not showing up. We talked with Steve for probably a little over an hour. He taught us how to maintain the proper pool water chemistry, which chemicals to use, and how to maintain use our pump (since we had no clue!). I learned a ton of information, and he did it without trying to push anything on us. He and his employee there were friendly, and extremely helpful. He was a pro, and definitely seemed like he was talking about. I also had to talk with another guy over the phone today, and he was also great to talk to. You guys just gained a customer.
1	It is called Leslie's Swimming pool supplies, THEY DO NO CARRY ANY ABOVE GROUND POOL PARTS..... Last I knew a pool above ground is a swimming pool??????
5	They are awesome and have everything you need!
1	This store has horrible customer service and high prices.  Can't see why it's so hard if they are busy to at least acknowledge you are there or since they are under staffed and your waiting to purchase something, the salesmen should remove himself from helping someone else to check you out.  Instead, I left my item at the counter and walked out and went to NPS Pool and Spa and got great customer service, in and out in 2 minutes.
4	My experience have been mostly positive and the staff are knowledgable and friendly. Sometimes they get busy but cant fault them for that.
4	Went over to the Leslie store in queens Creek yesterday and received help from Mick. Just wanted to share how helpful he was and as well as very knowledgeable of getting our pool to the perfect consistency thank you so much.
2	I've taken my water here to be tested for months. Every time I walked away with more chems and a $100 less in my pocket. I always felt that I was walking into a sales trap. Buying chems I didn't need.I have started going to another store west on queen creek a few miles. 1000x better.
