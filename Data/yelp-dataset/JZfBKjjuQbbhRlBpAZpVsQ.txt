4	Fancy a coffee and a bite to eat? Well, the Picnic Coffee Shop in South Queensferry is a great place to go to. Raised, just above the High Street in the centre of this small seaside town. This coffee shop feels quite warm inside and the food matches that warm welcoming feeling. From sandwiches to soups, this place will certainly fill that yearning for food! The service in the cafe is very good indeed, with everyone very friendly and helpful. Another bonus of this place is that you can obtain Internet access and that whilst you do that you can view the local art that is on the walls. The Picnic Coffee Shop is most defiantly worth a visit, and in this glorious summer weather, one can enjoy a cool drink in the outdoor area looking over the town.
4	Stopped here for lunch after touring around the area and stopping to take pictures of the Forth bridge. This place is pretty small and cramped, but cozy. They also had free wi-fi, which was great for us overseas tourists looking to check some email and post some messages.I ordered a ham and cheese pannini along with some lentil soup. Our food came out at separate times, because we could see that the person behind the counter was making them one at a time. No big deal. My sandwich was very good. Toasted just the right amount. Nice and crisp, and warm with gooey cheese, but not overdone. The soup was also quite nice. Very flavorful and piping hot, which was much appreciated on the rainy morning. The service was also very quick and the staff was friendly and personable, especially for us Americans who were clumsy with all the foreign coinage as we were trying to pay at the end.Great little place to stop in with great food and great character!
