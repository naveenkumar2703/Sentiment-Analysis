5	This company was able to work with my in-laws that lived in Northern California and provide them with coverage as if they were in Phoenix.  My mother-in-law, could not have been happier with the speed and efficiency that they worked with.  After replacing 2 windshields for my in-laws I am for sure going to call them if I ever have any issues.  Thanks for keeping me in the good graces with the in-laws!!
5	We received prompt, courteous and efficient service.  What more can one ask for?  I would recommend this to anyone.
4	Our experience with getting our windshield replaced was great. I procrastinated and avoided those guys at the car wash saying my windshield was cracked and unsafe. Finally I called American because I heard I could get a new windshield for free and they would come to my house. Too good to be true? It was true. As a topper their service was good too.
