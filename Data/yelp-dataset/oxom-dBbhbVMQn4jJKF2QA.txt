3	A great local gas and stop, it's super close to my house and always clean.  It's close to a lot of great places in the Northwest.  Nothing great or outstanding to report but if your out of gas or live close by it's not a bad place to stop by.
5	Quick, close and clean
4	Gotta live $0.49 medium slurpee!!!!!
5	This gas station has everything! The convenience store inside has a Domino's Pizza and a full service post office where you can buy stamps and ship packages, all while only waiting in line behind 2-3 people! The gas pumps outside never get too crowded so you never have to wait. I often come drop off a package and pump my gas and I'm off within 2-3 min! Pricing also seems pretty competitive for gas.
