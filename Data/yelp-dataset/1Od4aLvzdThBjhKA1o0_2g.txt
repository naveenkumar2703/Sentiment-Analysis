3	I like that QT workers are so friendly and efficient.I love that QT has a milkshake station...strawberry, mmm.I loathe the fact that this particular QT is lacking a filtered water option at the soda fountain area. Alternatively they direct you to a utility sink off by the bathroom, which I'm positive was not the filtered water they claimed it to be. Yuck!
5	Cleanest establishment. So many drinks to choose from! Good gas, list goes on & on....
5	I don't know how this Quick Trip location doesn't have 5 stars?!?!?! I am there just about every weekday morning & not only is this place CRAZY clean but there is ALWAYS someone attending to the floors or the drink machines or restocking hot foods/baked goods...!!! I appreciate seeing the same faces with their customary "Welcome to QuickTrip!" The morning manager is Ethan & he is definitely the guy QT management should be sending all of their trainees to!
5	Clean. Good prices. Tasty food. Friendly service. Not sure what else you are wanting from a gas station.
