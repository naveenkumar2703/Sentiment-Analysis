5	THE REAL DEAL!! I had to handle my first evicition on one of my rental properties. I had called two other process server companies before I called John who actually answered his phone. Very friendly and explained in simple terms how everything worked. Everything went smoothly and the people we were serving got papers the next day. Funny thing is one day AFTER John served them, I finally got a return call from the other process server company. Excellent service and a great price.
5	John is professional, efficient and reliable.  I needed some papers served and he managed to do it on the 4th of July, now that's servce!  He definitely delivers!!!!!Prices are reasonable and I have since recommended him to a group of people that use process servers in Arizona frequently so am happy to send work his way.
2	I'm not one to write a bad review at all, but I expect excellence when I pay something. I have been trying to get an item served for over a month and John stated that he went to the apartment about 7 times, but never was able to get ahold of the defendant. I hired another process server and he promptly delivered the service I requested in a day. Seems kind of fishy to me. Seemingly great guy, but if you want someone who gets things done I would look for someone else.
5	I went to John after i had already paid someone else and they gave me the run around and felt like they got me for my money. I spoke with John, he was honest and actually talked to me for 20mins and explained the process and answered my questions. I have never had to serve someone so I had a lot of questions and he had the answers. I paid him and he had the person served within 24hrs. And called me as soon as it was done. Definitely a sigh of relief to get this process moving. Would recommend him as well as use him again!!!thanks john
