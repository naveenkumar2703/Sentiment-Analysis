4	Variety for the Serious Bodybuilder to the Mindful Health fanatic and everything in-between.  This is a clean and fully stocked store with updated and cutting edge supplements.  I like this because I'm always looking for the next best thing.  It only takes a few visits before the friendly staff knows you by name and they genuinely accept input on products they should stock etc.  If you can think it up they can order it for you, I have successfully ordered bulk products from them at very reasonable prices.  The prices are generally overall less than GNC but slightly higher than online (which is usually the case in any supplement store).
5	Great store and Great location.  Very Friendly staff and I have a lot of luck finding the supplements that I use there.  They will put stuff aside (if you call ahead of time) and they will order things (if they can)Definitly a place to check out and WAY WAY WAY BETTER THAN GNC......GNC isn't an option compared to them.  GO THERE!
