3	They hold brewery tours here. But it is a scam, it is actually a beer sample tasting. If you are into that then you may enjoy it.
5	This place is THE place to go for private parties. Twice throughout my university experience I got 30 friends together, booked the brewery for 3 hours and drank all we could drink. It worked out to about $10-15 a person.They advertise it as a "brewery tour" but I promise you it is not. There is no tour, just a room, with a bar, and unlimited beer. Absolutely worth checking out at least once if you go to school in the area. We were allowed to bring birthday cake in, and decorate the room with balloons and streamers both times. For a small price we were also allowed to keep the place open an hour later than we had booked it.Both very VERY memorable evenings.
3	Saturday Sampling! $5 for any sample of any 6 beers in side the Lounge from 12:00 pm to 3 pm.Brick Brewery is a fun place to just have some cheap drinks and chill out with your friends. The pour is really generous and if you are a light weight like me, you can even share that with a friend.We drank:Waterloo Authentic Amber Waterloo Iron Horse BockRed Cap AleWaterloo Traditional IPAWaterloo Jack Pine BelgiumLaker LagerNothing too amazing or original but still enjoyable!I would consider Brick Brewery as a destination but a decent pit stop especially if you are in the area on a Saturday afternoon.There is also a beer store if you want to pick up a single, 6 packs or even a 58L keg for a home party!
