4	This is the first bank my mom and I went to, when we first moved here 20 years ago- this has been here, a very long time. My husband and I have accounts here- he used to work for B of A, for 14 years. This is the location where we have done the most business, since it's down the street from our home. Though there are many people here, we seem to get out of here pretty fast. The tellers are protected by a large wall of plexi-glass BTW. Some of the tellers know my husband and me, since we're regulars. Eva was really nice- she was personal banker, but we haven't seen her lately. The inside is a little dated and the floor is very wide open. Saturdays are open until 1 pm.  The walk up ATM is located on the front side, facing Sahara Avenue. The drive-thru ATMs are located in back.
1	Depressing. Slow. Blah. Traffic on I-15 and Sahara at rush hour crawls faster than the line moves inside this BOA. Need service from a banking assistant? Cool your heels pal, nobody moves fast here. This boring, dull, energy sucking place is a building that represents a waste of prime Sahara Ave. facing space. It needs to meet the team of "Renovations by Cat"....as in some large pieces of Caterpillar heavy construction equipment making the building a sand lot....On my visit to take care of just one thing it took 47 minutes. Then I had to go outside to use the ATM which took another 12 min but was still a much shorter wait vs. the line inside. Oh and the front ATM facing Sahara was down during my visit which the staff announced with that exasperated tone that makes it clear this is a regular occurrence...1 Star, only because I can't give negative stars.
