3	Cheesy Tots are back. Which means I will be be an avid visitor of Burger King while they last. I remember I was a sad panda a few years ago when they took them off the menu.There is just something about the ooey gooey cheesy inside, and the crunchy exterior.Also, if you didn't know Burger King has a buy one whopper, get one for $0.55 in celebration of thier anniversary. When it comes to fast food chains, I am a whopper kind of girl. The "flame broiled" taste wins me over every time.This location is typically fast and very accomodating. Due to the location you will see plenty of hookers, homeless and panhandlers outside the parking lot. Don't be surprised.
