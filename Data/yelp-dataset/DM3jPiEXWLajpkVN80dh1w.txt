5	I have been going to Dr Miller for a year now and have even referred business to him. Dr Miller has a wonderful bedside manner making you feel at ease from the start. I recommend Dr. Scott Miller to anyone who is afraid of going to the dentist. The patient is always #1 .
3	I have not met Dr. Miller.  I go there now because Dr. Canfiled retired from his practice and sold it to Dr. Miller.  The dental hygienist was the same and she does a fine job.
5	I have gone to Dr Scott Miller for about 15-20 years, as well as my children too.  He is a wonderful dentist with a great chairside manner.  He makes his patient feel like they are his only patient. He is honest and sincere. His staff is wonderful too. His hygentist Christie has been there forever and she is equally quality and personable as the Dr and his assistants.  I highly recommend this office!!!  Top Notch.
5	My family and I have been going to Dr. Miller for years and can't say enough good about him as a dentist and his staff.  Highly recommended!!
5	I have been going to Dr. Miller since 2001.  After spending years trying to find a good dentist, I found him. Not only was I able to get over my "severe" anxiety about going to the dentist, he has transformed my life with his superior work.  I would not smile much because my teeth were so horrible.  After some major dental work, I cannot stop smiling.  My confidence and pride escalated. He does superior work and with all the work I have had done, never has one thing hurt.  Seriously, how often can you say that about your dentist?  He is kind, ethical and is really a great man.  While not so happy with his hygienists(I get my teeth cleaned elsewhere) the rest of his staff is top notch as well.  I have recommended several people to Dr. Miller and they all have thanked me and have agreed.  HIs office manager, Kathy, is a gem.  Really good people
