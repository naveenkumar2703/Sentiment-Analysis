3	I don't know that I consider myself an expert on gelato, but I know I have had it while in Rome, and that may just make me a bit more knowledgable than others.If i had to sum this place up in a word, it'd be "meh".Lots of flavors, and they had fun little decorations in the flavors (much like the G Spot does), but some of the decorations looked like they had been out a bit too long. I can't remember the flavor I got, but I remember it being more icey than gelato-y. I was bringing a friend who had never had gelato before (and I had of course been RAVING about it) and I was a little embarassed that this was her first try.Girls behind the counter were VERY nice, they even asked me to go to azcentral and vote for the store to win something-or-other... I just smiled. I didn't have the heart to tell them that it didn't taste good enough for a vote. I don't know if their mixing or ingredients are a little off, if they had been sitting out too long, or what, but this was not the traditional gelato I was used to. Texture & flavor did not measure up.
5	Absolutely wonderful!  I actually signed up for yelp to write a nice review for this place.  I am not a big ice cream person, have been to italy and loved thier gelato, but never been a big "oh lets go get gelato" person here.  The point is that the gelato there is amazing, with amazing gourmet flavors that rotate frequently and I think it is family owned.  The employees are all so sweet and make tons of amazing little concoction samples for you before you have a chance to order. Also, I am a student and they give a nice discount.  Try it!
