1	Wow, what a disappointing experience. My hubby keeps telling me to stop buying Groupons and I might start listening (cannot guarantee). I am not sure if it is because I had a groupon or not, however I didn't feel welcomed. I get my brows done next door by Koltton who is amazing.  First thing she told me was to wait in the waiting area since she was running late. Ok, my next appointment was not until noon so I was not too worried. 15 minutes later and I started getting nervous. I was about to text my next appointment when she came to get me at 11:05.  I was never given a cover up to put over my clothing, not even a dentist's paper bib. She just told me to lay down and she started removing my make-up, then a little rubbing of something else. After she put a gauzy feeling mask over my face. She removed it and said, "we are done".  I always tip, so I tipped her $10 and left. It was 11:25 when I got in my car.   I couldn't believe it, so I went to my groupon page to check.  It was supposed to be a 30 minute "Red Carpet Facial",  guess I don't need to come back.
5	I have received services at Perfect Skin for more than ten years and really they are the only ones I trust to touch my face. The staff is friendly and professional and I feel comfortable knowing that this is a doctor supervised business and not just a salon or spa. I really appreciate the call reminders and follow up calls I receive every time I have a treatment. I highly recommend!
1	What ever you do, do not let Dr Bergmier put a laser anywhere near your face! He does not have to proper experience and left my face permanently hyperpigmented. I paid 1500.00 to get my face messed up for life. I've spend hundreds of dollars trying to get it corrected. Worst mistake I ever made.
