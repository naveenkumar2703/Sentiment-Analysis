4	Hey, it's the club with a nice restaurant on the side inside your mall. You look around inside and you could swear that you're in NYC and not LV.Well, it's a great mixture of both.Lovely wait staff, and energetic bartenders. The one dance floor gets crazy only after 1AM. VIP table service is solid--though not as omnipresent as that at Pure.Oh, and the food at the restaurant is fine too.
