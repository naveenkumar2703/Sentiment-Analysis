3	The event held on July 19 was a charity function for the Three Square Food Bank andwas at Bagatelle beach club. Loved the venue, though it was close quarters when the crowd grew to full capacity.Some of the vendors had a full display table and others just had the beer. It looked like not all the vendors knew this would be a packed event, as having one person to pour for the crowd is a bad idea. I got in right around 6 and the line was very long to get in. I was able to sample quite a few brews before the masses arrived, and I left early due to an oncoming storm. For $25 (Groupon), there was a lot of beer to sample. I loved the coconut water booth, that was a hugh booth manned by one overwhelmed but friendly woman.
2	Nice location, lousy beer selection. The event could have better if tickets were limited. Too many people crammed into a small areao. It was difficult to travel from vendor to vendor. There are many beer festivals in LV. This was the worst one we've been to, and we've been to all of them.
