4	Consistently the best dressing room service in all of Madison!  No matter how many pairs of jeans I need, they'll keep them coming and do their best to find fits that 'fit'.  Lucky, Seven, and more- prices about what you'd expect- head straight for the sale rack in the back because they won't tell you about it...
2	HOLY CRAP!!!OK, now before I get into a pissing match with anyone I just have to say this, the place is ridiculously expensive. I don't get why you have to spend almost $200 on 1 pair of jeans? I mean come on!! I guess I would expect this from a store like this, but it's mostly all graphic t-shirts and pants..I do like the style..but I mean everything in there is graphic-ified. haha.I did purchase a purse from there that I still wear today, but they are cheaply made. The lining of the purse tore open for some odd reason, I'm not ruff with my pruses and don't keep knives in there..all the time.. ;)~I do know they have a sale rack in the back that is unmarked which I found odd..basically you have to read the tag to find out how much your paying..it's always a good hunt! I'd say go in, look around, but don't waste your money on their clothes. Or purses. You can find better quality. ;)~
4	So contrary to what some people say about this place, I like it. I mainly like it for their jeans selection. Yes it is quite expensive but from what I have purchased from here? It lasts forever... Some of the jeans have larger stitching on the back pockets so it can get snagged on say a wood splinter while sitting a wood bench! Haha. They have a great selection of Graphic Tees and lots of nice button-up shirts. Prices vary on those and so do the brands they carry. They carry a HUGE amount of different brands for Tees. The staff? I can't say as many nice things. They almost act like they are doing you a favor by just letting you in the place... It was really unsettling.
