5	Love having fresh juice smoothies alkaline water weight loss consultations and more all under one roof
2	Now known as a new name, I believe it was called "Yo Fresh".The inside was kind of dirty and the fro yo machines were mostly broken. The smoothie was really sugary and not "fresh" like the name implies. My hope is that they are brand new and working on fixing the place up.
5	Owner was super helpful and made a special drink for what I needed.
