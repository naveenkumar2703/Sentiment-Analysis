5	Used the services of Pampered Pets and Plants Jan 2013 for 3.5 weeks to take care of my cat (daily 30 min home service visit). Everything they state on their website met my expectations 100%. Price was $22 per day, and there were no extra hidden costs. My assigned carer was Jill Freedman.  She is very experienced and made me feel very at ease at first interview (in home).  I also spoke with the Owner on the phone, and she was very professional and caring about my specific needs.  Jill left daily summary notes about my cat's health (eating, bathroom, social activity). She emailed me once or twice a week to let me know my cat was happy, and that everything as fine with the apartment. I had such peace of mind on my trip thanks to Jill.  She even emptied coffee grinds from my machine that I'd forgotten to do the day I left (got smelly after 10 days or so), and emailed me when a notice was attached to my door from the apartment rental office.  Apt was immaculate upon return with a freshly changed litter box, all trash removed, and nothing out of place.  Very professional and friendly service.   I highly recommend this team!
