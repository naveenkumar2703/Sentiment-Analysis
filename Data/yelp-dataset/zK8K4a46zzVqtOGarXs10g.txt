2	As a fast food joint my expectations are not high, but when you give me cool, somewhat soggy onion rings and a cold whopper dang!I love the onion ring sauce and am convinced they put cocaine in it.  That saved my otherwise lackluster meal.  Also, the drive through was fast.  There, I said something nice.
2	I went in and ordered some Chicken Sandwich's. I got home and looky here I got whopper Jr.'s. I didnt mind as I made it work. But I feel bad for the person who ordered a Whopper Jr. and got a Chicken Sandwich.
2	No sweet potato fries anymore and $2 for a tea? McDonalds here I come! And their regular fries have changed yet again.
1	Tried these losers again, only because my son begged me. Maria rang up my egg & cheese croissant breakfast meal....$8.91.....really? When I questioned the amount, she told me it was right and showed me the cash register. Well, you can't fix STUPID! We left, unfed.
4	This review is based on the Drive Thru Only. All my experiences have been through the drive thru. The customer service at the driver through has always been superior. Friendly service with a smile. Orders were repeated. Cash handling has been accurate. All my orders have been correct. All my food has hot and fresh.
