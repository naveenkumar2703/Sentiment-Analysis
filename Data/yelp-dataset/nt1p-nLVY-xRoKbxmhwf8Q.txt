3	This place deserves maybe a 3-plus rating.  It's just a little rice bowl/sushi place with a limited menu and a karaoke machine in the corner.  But the staff was pleasant, the food was tasty and inexpensive, and everything about the place, from the signs in the windows to the decor inside told me just what to expect--Japanese-style rice with "stuff" on it.  I had the mixed tempura bowl--four tempura shrimp, an assortment of vegetables, and the usual dipping sauce.  It's certainly a lot better and no more expensive than the similarly-named "Yoshinoya" on Maryland Parkway, which redefined "foul".
