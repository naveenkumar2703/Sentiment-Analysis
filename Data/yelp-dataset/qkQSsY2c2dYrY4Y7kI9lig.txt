4	This is an express Mickey D's with two drive throughs for quick access.  I wasn't too thrilled that I received a Coke with an unsecured lid that spill in my lap during my first time through though.  Other than that, it is your typical experience at a McDonald's.
5	I love this Express Mcdonald's !Mcdonald's has the best fast food breakfast and I can always enjoy me a Big Mac and fries.  I usually stop here about once a month for either meal mentioned above on my way to work.Prices are a little lower.  Employees are always nice and friendly.  Efficient.
3	McDonalds "Express". I waited about 9 minutes for the person in front of me to get their food. I'm not sure what they ordered but they only got one bag. When I pulled up, there was no apology for the wait. Just "hi, your total is 5.62" or whatever the change was. Food tasted fine, but service and wait times were subpar. I'll drive further for the McDonalds 1 mile in the other direction.
