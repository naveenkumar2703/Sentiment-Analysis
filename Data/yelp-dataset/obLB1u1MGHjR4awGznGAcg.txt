4	Any place that's willing to import flowers from Holland on a daily basis, gets my vote. I love reviewing flower shops, it's like theres a party in my nostrils (and your all invited, but take your shoes off first). Lily pad do you typical selection for weddings, funerals and sorry boyfriends and also do a nice selection of planets for your house.I like it,, I hope I never mess up so bad that I have to use it!
4	A great flower shop in the area of Morningside. They have some absolutely stunning compositions and you know they are talking about professional business with fresh flowers brought in every day! Ideal for a simple bouquet or for even more special occasions like weddings, they can cater for your needs.Of course pretty flowers come with a price, but beats by miles and miles the Tescos flowers, so worthy for the more special occasions.
4	This place is a great florists in Marchmont which not only provides flowers for all occassions, but also a range of house and garden plants.  It has a stylish sign and inside it feels and smells fresh, clean and summery.  They have a huge range of flowers which are all within a few days old and entirely seasonal.  They also show plenty of helpful suggestions throughout the shop for how to arrange flowers and which are appropriate for which occassion.  The service is friendly and they are keen to lend a helping hand to all ignorant customers.  Their prices are well above average, but this is definitely a case of paying for what you get.  The Lily Pad is a great florists with an inviting atmosphere and innovative ideas for how to sell their flowers and plants.
