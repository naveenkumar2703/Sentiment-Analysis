3	A sad day. America West, you were Phoenix's pride and joy. We loved serving as your hub..your homage to the southwestern region was truly remarkable...you made the never-ending delightful sunshine burn my eyes & heart to a degree I didn't think was possible...BUT LOOK AT YOU NOW.What happened? You poor pathetic thing. Did someone take advantage of you?? Was it US Airways? I see they got a hold of you now.. Did you give your consent?Well, regardless, your future doesn't look so bright.. You are on the path to nowhere.You've let your website, your customer service, and your good looks fade...You know  we have some serious talking to do, mister.
2	Cramped Seating, Old, and small compartment above for carry on.  At least I made it back to SFO alive!!!!  They get a star for that.
1	God I wish there was such a thing as negative stars.  The Company is the absolute worst Company in the World.  Not just the worst Airline.  They truly SUCK in the biggest way!I used to travel to Phoenix every week for business.  America West has left me stranded so many times I can not even count on both hands and feet.  They make me sick!And every employee of the company hates the airline and their jobs too.  nobody cares because their management sucks so bad.Please God, send a lightning bolt to each of the Executives of this company!!!!
1	Update Nov 30, 2007: I just got billed an annual fee of $79 on a Mastercard that stated no fee** UPDATE: worse to Hall of Shame **America West Flight Fund Number 01311513962 Balance  80,875 US Air Dividend Miles #: 00453636268Balance is zero. 0. Zilch.  NadaWhen you buy a company, value the people who used to buy from the company you acquired.  Taking their miles away is pretty much the LAST thing you should do**********************************A Dub is in a tailspin.  A flat tailspin into the mountainous dessertA Dub used to be a good little airline.  Now that US Air bought them, its starting to look bleak...Incident #1: bad SJ employees.  Old crew is all but gone save two stragglers.  In are the new employees that look like they're from a temp agency.Incident #2: hold times on phone over 1 hour.  Normally I write in to preserve my rights but I was given, "800-247 5691" to call in to activate expiring milesIncident #3: remote ticket offices are decimated.  If HALF your customers are too old to use the INTERNET, don't close your mall ticket office!  Whatever analyst crunched the excel forgot the line items: Brand awareness, face-to-face contact, service as a salesperson under GOODWILLSome businesses get sick when they get bought: I am adding this to my Yelp list, "Businesses that suck under the new mgmnt"
1	I've tried to stay from reviewing America West because I worked here as a flight attendant. It's been years, though, and I'm still telling horror tales of my time here. I started here as a young, fresh-eyed girl that couldn't wait to travel and see new places. I left jaded and bitter more scared of flying than I had ever been before. I made lots of good friends and met lots of amazing people but everyone seemed unhappy with their job, pay, benefits, etc. I'll summarize by telling you this. . . . We had a joke contest  going around coming up with new company slogans. Mine won. It was "America West. Where departure times are just a suggestion".
