4	The curry house meal for 2 takeaway I had was plentiful and of a decent standard. Good curries are plentiful in Edinburgh and the only reason it didn't stand out was it was a carry out. Good value?About the price for a decent meal with lots to choose from. I would love to see a restaraunt do something different for a change,maybe I'm missing something but they all seem the same really. Batches of sauce and regularity of tastes for example it is hard to rate.I'll go again and again to the Curry house,but I live within 1km seemingly. The chicken korma tasted like the chicken was added rather than cooked with the sauce,but who buys kormas anyway?
