2	I'm a frequent flier with Big Lots, but this store is neither special nor is it nice... Nor is it particularly clean! I just happened to be in the area, thought I'd give it a whirl... Better off checking out the store on McKellips & Scottsdale rd., or Thomas and 32nd st.
4	This is one of the crappiest Big Lots I've been in.So why the 4 stars?Because they try...The staff is a bit "off"but they are so much more friendly than some other locations.The lady who was ringing up my purchase had to stop in the middle for a sec because the shiny ornaments I was purchasing startled her.She had to take a step back,got all twitchy for a moment,apologized for the delay,explained that the mini disco ball "scared"her,re-composed herself and finished ringing up the sale.I give her credit for carrying on even with the fear and hope the experience gave her the confidence to know she can persevere.Big Lots,I salute you.
1	This place is always understaffed.  You can wait in line to check out for 20 min. or more.  Also their check-out process seems less than efficient.
4	Sure, why not?  I found my patio furniture here and I'm happy with it, happy with the service I received, and happy with the price.
