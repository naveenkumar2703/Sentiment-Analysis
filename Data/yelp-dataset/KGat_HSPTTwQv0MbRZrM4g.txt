3	Great place to buy onesies or pajamas for infant to toddler. Good prices especially if you sign up with your email and address. They'll send coupons in the mail and have punch cards where if you spend $100 you get $10 off!  Sometimes other clothes are cute and sometimes not, but definitely worth the trip.
4	I love this store.  I have twin sons, so finding a place that sells good quality clothes at reasonable prices is very necessary.  Carter's is my go to place for everyday clothing for my sons.  They always have the cutest onesies, pajamas, sweater, pants, and jackets.Definitely sign up for emails directly with Carters.  You will get coupons emailed to you all the time.  Plus, check out the website before you head over to the store because you can sometimes find coupons right on the page to print out.  Also, definitely try to shop around holiday weekends - think Memorial Day or Labor Day - because you can combine their big sales with coupons they send out.The only negative about the store is the size.  They have tons of items crammed into a smaller shop.  While I love the amount of variety they have, the sheer massiveness of items makes it hard to get around the store.  If you have a stroller, forget about it!  Tip:  There is an IHOP right on Las Vegas Blvd in front of the mall, park in line with that restaurant, but close to the mall of course, and Carter's is the first store on the left when you enter the mall at that side.  Super convenient!
4	I love this place! The store is very clean and organized. The girls and boys section is split down the middle. The best time to go is during Black Friday. If you are expecting or already have a baby, this is the place to go.They always have great deals. Sign up for the mailing list to receive coupons.
