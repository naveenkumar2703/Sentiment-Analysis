3	You save $.20 a gallon if you buy a $6 carwash combo and pay with debit/credit card. Good deal on the gas but the carwash isn't that great. Not sure if it's their water or the chemicals they use but it left white spots on my vehicle. I wipe my vehicle dry to remove the remaining spots.  The funny thing is that my vehicle looks a little dirtier when it came out the wash. Sorry but I would not recommend the carwash.
4	I used to go here all the time until green valley Shell opened up down the road. The prices for everything a higher here but they do have good food. The place is clean as well as the eating area. Got fuel here many times and never had any problems with it. Car was is ok. Good place if its late and you  don't want to go far.
2	Don't buy groceries here. I bought a container of milk. The expiration date is over a week away and the milk was bad. Obviously it sat out before it went into the fridge. Yuck!
