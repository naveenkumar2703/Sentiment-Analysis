1	I went into this location and had a coupon for a buy one foot long sub get the second one for 99 cents well my total ended up being $15.76, sounds a  bit high, well my preparer Hector "Clerk 21" did not how to use the register and called another employee to ring in my coupon, which they did not apply obviously since my bill was almost $16.00 and they were cursing and were rude and were complaining about how they did not have time to mess around because they had a party platter order they had to prepare. Very disappointing, maybe Subway should invest in better training or maybe higher wages to get better staff.
3	Ok...so my first review of this place, if I had my way the health inspector would have closed it and subway would have needed to send me a check for damages for my personal distress.Wheres Johnny Cochran when ya need him!  This is kind of what happened to this location, they closed down and remodeled, I would have to say that since the remodel, this place has kind of cleaned up a bit, and they do have some pretty good employees, there is one fat girl that works there now that is a bit rude still, like she hates life and everybody in it because she is overweight, but for the most part the rest of the staff is pretty good. The food is how can you say, what you would expect, it's a sandwich buffet with some one else making the sandwich, I mean I could probably never give this place 5 stars, but as far as fast food places go this place is up to par.
5	I love Subway and not all of them still have the seafood salad. This one does and that's the only sandwich I get and I get it often so it's nice when  I'm remembered. I just wish they had a frequent visit card.
