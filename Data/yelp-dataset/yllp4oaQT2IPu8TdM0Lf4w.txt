5	Absolute professionals - I needed something done in three days that was previously quoted at twice the time and twice the money from other companies. Sherry and the Fastsigns team did an AMAZING job printing 8x10ft wall panels for my booth at Magic - I actually won an award for "Most Innovative Booth Interior!" They even delivered my job to my hotel on Saturday! Don't waste your time looking anywhere else, they are it!
5	I work at a museum and volunteer at another, and both use Fastsigns to create wall vinyls and foamcore signage. The printing is always beautiful -- fine enough to hang among the artwork in the exhibitions -- and done quickly and quite affordably. I can't speak for every location, but this one (#75) has an incredibly helpful and patient staff, always ready with advice and forgiving of mistakes. When the second museum needed printing, I had no qualms recommending this Fastsigns based on my experiences at the first.
5	We had some signs made for around the office and the team at Fast Signs on Maryland Parkway were fast and helpful. The quality of the signs were also great. Would definitely recommend.
1	I absolutely would not use this company again after speaking with the manager, Sherry, about the work they did on my exterior signs. I would post a photo on Facebook, but these signs reflect poorly on my business! Poor judgment was used in the size of the lettering in my business name, even though Fast Signs was provided with a copy of our logo. When they could see that the name being inserted between two existing lines would be tiny, they should have realized there was an issue and called us instead of printing these signs without a proof and then quoting me full price to redo the signs! We could have changed the font or authorized them to print it much larger. Justifying a bad decision by blaming the customer is just never a way to get repeat business.
