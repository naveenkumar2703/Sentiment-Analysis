2	The Fry's Pharmacy is SOOOO slow...  They have great prices compared to CVS but the service at CVS is so much better!  Frys doesn't go the extra mile to help you get the prescription refilled - they make you do all the work.  CVS was willing to make all the necessary contacts.  Also, if the prescription is pricey they don't fill it until you ask for it again a second time.  They just assume you don't want it because it's more than the $4 cheap prescriptions.  The lines for the pharmacy are ridiculous - and very slow!  As long as you have at least 30 minutes to wait in line, it's ok.  For the lower pharmacy pricing you have to weigh the other factors in as well.
4	Not my go to grocery store, but when I need a quick fix for a dessert craving I come here! They usually what I'm looking for wether it be a certain chocolate bar, or a tasty cream cheese filled croissant! Like most grocery stores the cashier to customer ratio sucks, but not as bad as Walmart! Since I'm the duchess you already know I'll be back for more nom noms. ;)
