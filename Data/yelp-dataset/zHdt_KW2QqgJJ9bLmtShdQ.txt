4	In August we had 4 new tires installed.  Whether tires, brakes, or other mechanical issues we have received very satisfactory service over the years.
5	The manager and mechanics are kind, honest people who provide phenomenal service. I went in to have my muffler and center pipe replaced due to rusting issues. They saved me $600 over the dealership service quote, had the required parts delivered within the hour, and finished the maintenance itself in about an hour.  I felt entirely comfortable trusting my car to them, and plan to have all of my future servicing done here.
5	Long family road trip and had a tire sensor go off. Had a long trip. Guys were busy, but squeezed us in - just to help us out. Wanted to be safe with 350+ miles to go. They were quick and awesome just helping us to feel safe.
