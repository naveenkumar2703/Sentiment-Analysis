1	The gas at this station is not the problem here. It's the Car Wash!  My car was filthy due to the rainy days we'd had in the Phoenix area. I drove my car to Tumbleweed to get gas as well as get a car wash. After driving through, I noticed several weird streaks on my car. I tried to buff them out with a clean towel only to make it worse. At first I thought maybe my car was so dirty, that it needed a second wash. About a week later, I returned to this same station for gas and a wash. Again with the weird streaks all over my car! I have washed my car at this station over the last few years when it was a Valero, and never had this issue. Now I am absolutely convinced that the new owners do not maintain the chemicals for the Car Wash. I paid for two Car Washes within two weeks $8  each ..... The Ultimate Car Wash. What it was ..... was an Ultimate waste of money! Do not wash your car here unless you want it to look worse than it did before!
2	Stopped here for a soda after a long afternoon of shopping.  I wasn't very impressed with this location.  The convenience store was small and originally the doors were locked, because the attendant was returning from a break. The fountain drink machine didn't have any cups available so I settled for bottled instead. They only had 1 bottle of the type I wanted. At the register the attendant was very friendly and pleasant.  Although I do have to say that the prices were overpriced, even for a convenience store.
1	Maybe it was that uncomfortable stare down when I walked in or maybe it was the pure uncomfortable feeling when we pulled in to get gas. This location has hookers and tweekers scattered up and down the streets in this area. Hanging out by entrance. Well at least I got gas. Could be worse...I could have been stuck out in some desert or strange town where chainsaw massacre kills me or the hills have eyes captures me and kills me slowly.
