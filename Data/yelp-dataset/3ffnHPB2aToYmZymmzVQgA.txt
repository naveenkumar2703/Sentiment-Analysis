1	How do you go through life and try to win over new business when the first word is always NO ???It says bank on the outside, but try to get change to break a couple twenties for coinage, and was asked if I had an account there. You're a BANK ! Where is your customer service? Great way to run of new business
4	The bank is very clean and pleasant to visit (though it's eerily quiet with no music playing at all- even a tiny, tinny pocket or clock radio on someone's desk...) Everyone there is cordial enough and they are immediately at their respective stations ready to help you as you walk in the doors. Well, it's a bank :)What would I do to enhance the experience? Notice my choice of adjectives used... let's make "cordial" into "friendly" (read: Less Stepford Wives, More Flo from Progressive) and "eerily quiet" into "for Pete's sake some elevator music at least" LOL!
5	Great bank with great service and very friendly staff.
1	Terrible access.  When we first signed up there were no fees at ANY bank's ATMs.  Now they have added CVS ATMs and removed that feature.  Go inside a CVS or drive thru ANY bank - NOPE NOT THE SAME, not even close!!!  Then they "suspected" fraudulent charges on DH debit.  Customer service turned it off.  No phone call, no e-mail, no note on the account, nothing!  Just shuts it off!!!  Best part - 4 weeks later and 3 requests and STILL NO PIN number.  Really, its not rocket science, print out a pin, put it in the mail.  I could understand 1 getting mis-delivered, but 3!!!!  Oh and customer service does nothing but say "just wait".  In branch, "Can't help you."  Seriously, this bank is a joke!  Stay far, far away!!!!
1	They advertise free accounts, but I have found that the opposite is true.  I have paid inactivity fees, falling below the balance fees, not using auto pay fees, etc.  More of my money went to them than to me or my household accounts.  Very disappointed.
