3	I stopped in here one day because I have never been to a Big Lots before. It was okay, a lot of bargains for different odds and ends. I was actually surprised they had furniture here - indoor and outdoor. I recently came in to look at their christmas decorations and everything was ransacked and picked over, though that probably had something to do with the store closing soon and everything being marked an extra 20% off.
4	Pretty standard Big Lots as far as offerings, however, they are a large location so they have lots of aisles to meander and they are well organized compared to some of the other locations throughout Phoenix.  We were greeted by a cashier on our way in and asked if we needed help by another staff member we passed on our way down an aisle. They didn't have the trial sized item we were looking for so we ended up not making a purchase here, but it's for sure a location we'd go back to - especially since it's right next to the mall.Overall: AClean, well organized and lots of options.
