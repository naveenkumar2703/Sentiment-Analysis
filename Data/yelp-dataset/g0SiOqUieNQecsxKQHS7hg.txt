3	So here's a tip for you less seasoned travelers: when getting the breakfast buffet at a hotel, and they offer scrambled eggs, don't be the first to get them. Because the eggs will sit in the warming tray for hours, they bring them out a little soupy knowing that they'll firm up with the constant heat. Yuck.Anywho, my buddy and I were first for the breakfast buffet, runny eggs and all. Other than that, the food service was great. Bacon had a selection of crispy and not crispy, sausage was done evenly, potatoes were crisp, pancakes were warm and fluffy. In fact, everything but the eggs was great.
4	We eat here a couple of time a month, the food is always good and the service is good.  The lunch prices are great for a sit-down.
4	Stayed at the holiday inn, and had the "free" hot breakfast here. It was very good, service good, both quality and quantity...buffet. First class as far as included-with-room breakfasts!
1	Gross! I decided to try the hotel restaurant this time. It took like 40 minutes to get my food and the pasta sauce tasted like it was canned. I could have microwaved better food in my room.
