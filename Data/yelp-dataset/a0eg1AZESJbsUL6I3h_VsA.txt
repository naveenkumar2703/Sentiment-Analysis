3	To my surprise, the turkey club sandwich I bought at Kokopeli Deli located at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Aiport (Terminal 3) was quite tasty!  Aside from a good amount of turkey, it came with tomato, lettuce, crispy bacon and mayonnaise on wheat bread.  The turkey tasted well with the warm crispy bacon and juicy tomato slices.  The downside, as all food sold at airports, the price for the turkey club sandwich was a bit high at $7.50 with a soft drink bottle at $2.70!
3	Stuck in PHX airport and need something that's not pizza or burgers? This place has expensive, but decent, salads that don't suck like most airports' salads do. I had the chicken Caesar which was fresh and pretty generous. They also have a "Chinois" salad which I think is Arizonan for Chinese. :)
1	Service is the word or lack of it.  WOW!
1	Yet another terrible airport restaurant! Terrible, terrible, terrible. All I wanted was a simple sandwich to go. First, $8 for a simple turkey sandwich?  When I asked for it "to go" he put a lid on the plate. Really?  How am I supposed to fit that in my luggage??  All I wanted was a subway style piece of paper!
2	It's in the airport !!! it gets two stars if you can eat the whole sandwich without gagging.
1	Service was so slow.  Food was so so but better airport choices then this place.
1	This place is the only food one inside terminal 3 American Airlines gates, it is supposed to open at 5 am but at 5:15 am it is still closed. The 2 employees are just starting to set up and there is a line of people waiting to get some coffee and they don't care to even tell you how long it will take them to open.No wonder they have such bad reviews!Finally opened at 5;22 am
