5	Why hasn't this been reviewed yet?  This place is THE place for choco-addicts.  The best, I'm talking major scrumpa-lumptious!   It's one of my favorite gifts to send.  Also good for custom corporate gifts.  My fav?  This is a hard one...how about my top 4...raspberry swirl, peanut butter, coconut and mint chocolate.
5	Best brownies in world, handcrafted from Callebaut dark Belgian chocolate, premium butter, farm fresh eggs, fluffy cake flour -- And, says the website -- "A dash of magic!" I am tempted to believe them. I am a decent cook and have made my share of brownies (both from the box and from scratch). Mine have never tasted like these. So, magic? Maybe...
5	These brownies aren't the best I've ever hadBut they're pretty darn closeI usually send these as presents to my friends in other states.I oftentimes pick up a few at AJ's!  AJ's usually has a few different flavors of these brownies individually packaged near the checkout counters. Me likey.
