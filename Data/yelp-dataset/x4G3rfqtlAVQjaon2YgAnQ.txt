4	Great pharmacy and the reward points program is very nice, I have already received four $5 discounts and I haven't been using it too long.
4	I am not a Walgreens fan much anymore as most of the time their pharmacy staff are rude and simply just not helpful.  However, this location is open 24 hours and that is why I am fan.
1	Well I am trying to think of a nice way to phrase just how terrible this pharmacy is. I am a Walgreens customer, but my normal Walgreens is not 24 hours and so therefore sometimes I am forced to use this place. I hate it. The area is not the best, the staff are jerks, and the service is possibly top 10 worst. I have never not had to wait in a 10+ minute wait line. I guess a positive is that they forwarded the prescription to another 24 hour pharmacy correctly? Don't go. Drive further and go elsewhere.
