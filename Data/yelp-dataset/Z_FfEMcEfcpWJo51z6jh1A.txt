5	Dr. D, thank you for giving my twin boys and daughter smiles that will last a life time!  You are truly the best and I love the entire staff!
5	Wonderful experience. Was referred here by our dentist for a consult for my 10 year old. The staff was very attentive to my wife and I but specially with my son, really made us all feel at ease. They presented two very clear option plans and there was no pressure. Still can't believe how comfortable the whole experience was.
