5	Pretty sweet place. We walked around it after we ate dinner. They just opened like a week ago. They have all sorts of stuff, paintings, very large animal statues, chandeliers, glass vases, tables, living room furniture, just to name a few I remembered.Shop owner was really nice and chatted us up.
1	PSYCHOWe were walking through casino from Paris to Bally's when we saw a giant bronze bear that was almost 7 feet tall. We decided to go in and check it out. An older gentleman approached us with a really cool mustache. I inquired how much is the bear. He looked at me and said, "4250!" I then said to my buddy, "He said 4250!" My buddy, Tony M said, "$42.50!" The guy then went ballistic!!! He looks at us and says, "I'm raising the price for you to $43,000!" We laughed thinking the guy was being funny with us. He then said, "If you don't have $43,000 in your wallet then get out of the store!" He then took his hand and slapped himself as hard as he could into his bald forehead. I realized that this guy must be crazy!A second salesman came up to us to smooth things over but we were done. We weren't spending our hard earned money on a giant bronze bear. A couple of other customers walked out with us. We all talked about how crazy the sales guy was and wondered does anyone ever buy anything there?We never made it past the giant bronze bear but I'm sure everything in here is overpriced for the high rollers or recent casino winners. We won't be coming back but we will always remember the day we survived the psycho bronze bear salesman. Welcome to Vegas!
