5	This is a franchised location not far from my house...the food is great and reasonably healthy and they don't charge extra for extra sauce at this location...the only other location I've been to does charge extra.  Kudos in my book for a place that doesn't charge extra for a sauce they are known for!!  I just wish they were open longer hours on weekends but I'm sure their weekend hours are due to the fact that they are located in a commercial area.
4	The food is good with very generous portions of everything...........yep. That's it! oh yeah, odd location but it was close to my work so that's nice.......ok........thats it. oh, and the people were nice and good at describing the food. I got this huge plate that had teriyaki beef AND chicken....alright......thats it............for reallies this time.
4	Food is always made fresh and I have never had to wait too long.  Good place to come for lunch if you work in the area.
5	Was craving Teriyaki chicken with white meat and brown rice....for some reason that's hard to find. I was so happy to find a Samurai Sams some what by the house. Its near an industrial area so its hard to see it...use ur gps or keep your eyes open. Food was great though and fast. Not so fast though that you knew they "warmed up you chicken in the microwave" fast though. It was cooked to order. The gal at the counter was great too. Very friendly! Always a plus. So food and service are great. Ill go back!
1	Tastes bad, food all seems processed, and my food was ordered and ready within 30 seconds - literally. At least hold onto my food for a few minutes to make me believe the food is fresh. Wouldn't recommend, this is my first time here and I won't ever be back.
