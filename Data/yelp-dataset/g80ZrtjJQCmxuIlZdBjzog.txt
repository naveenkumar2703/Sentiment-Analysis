5	This furniture consignment shop is new to madison and the owners are really great.  It's a fun place to shop for local art and good deals on used furniture that is in good condition and for a lot less than you would pay new.   I stopped in just to browse and check out their grand opening...I will definitely keep going back and watch their website to see new arrivals.  The mix of eclectic, funky and comfy pieces is very cool!
5	We went to Comfy Chair looking for some bar stools. Didn't find any - but found a bunch of other stuff we would have loved to bring home! It's mostly furniture: chairs, tables, dressers, coffee tables, etc. A really neat collection of stuff with character. Everything seems pretty reasonably priced. The owner told use to keep up with new inventory via Facebook. Looks like he posts pictures pretty regularly. The shop is down the road from Odana Antiques and right across the street from the Habitat for Humanity Upstore - so it'll be a regular stop for us when we are looking for a DIY project.
1	Not much here... outrageous prices for creepy and weird used stuff.
