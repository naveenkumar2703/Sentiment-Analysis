4	I really like the new Terminal 3 in this Las Vegas Airport.  Good restaurants/bars and the duty free shop has a great selection of booze and all sorts of stuff... so dont spend all your money at the casino!
4	Great selection!! You can even taste the wine/alcohol before buying it,Annoyed that I had to wait so long in line, but sh*t happens.
5	I love how this store has the most interesting selections from technology, sweets, and clothing items. Not to mention, Gucci watches and jewelry. I would consider this the high end of ABC stores that leans more towards a department store feel as you can get great gifts minus the tacky touristy items as you travel back home.  However, it comes with a higher price tags as they include the tax into the retail price even though it is considered Duty Free.  This is the place to come for all your needs even if you're looking to space out with some nice new Dre headphones during your 10 hour flight home which is a must.
4	This is a pretty great duty free. I went to this duty free intending to buy a bottle of the Johnny walker explorers collection. They had deep stock of the entire collection. I was very happy to get the bottle I was looking for because the last time I travelled through a different duty free owned by the same company they didn't have the bottle I wanted (which is only sold at duty free) so I had to go without for 6 months. Vegas duty free is well stocked and conveniently located terminal 3.
4	Decent duty free store - lots of the usual beauty brands and jewelry/accessories (Lancome, Michael Kors), and a small Victoria's Secret store (mostly accessories). I was looking to pick up a bottle of scotch and there is a good selection, maybe 25 choices? Prices seemed high for a duty free store but I assume that is because it's Vegas.
