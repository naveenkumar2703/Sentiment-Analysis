3	good selection of quality makes.Staff are always there if you need them and are friendly.
4	When I think of Burton, I think of square-toed, black leather shoes with a buckle on the top, of sensible, loose-fitting beige polo shirts, sensible slacks and Ford Mondeos. Stereotypes exist for a reason, but in the past few years Burton has done quite a bit to rid themselves of their "dad on the dancefloor" image. It's not really about high fashion, but while I feel utterly alienated by the effeminate preening style championed in Topman, Burton feels homely and reassuringly male. A bit dull perhaps, but at least they're not suggesting I wear hairspray and eyeliner. It's best for officewear and what I can only describe as "kicking about" clothes. T-shirts, jeans, the odd hoodie. They may take a slating from people who define your personality by what tawdry nightclubs you hang about in, but I'm more than happy to give Burton the thumbs up.
4	It's nice to see a shop exclusively for men on the high street that doesn't only sell suits!Burton fills a gap in the market for those too proud to go to Topman or too poor to go to Cruise. It's bang on!the prices are pretty decent for what they sell, and the stuff is always on trend and pretty fashionable really. The staff are always really happy to help and really grounded, refreshigly so!Plus if you're a student, it's 10% off! woohoo
4	I really like Burton. I would much rather see a guy who was kitted out in the stuff here than the likes of the skinny jeans in Topman. Over style conscious guys make me feel a little uncomfortable as while I love clothes, I never particularly follow any trends, I just march to the beat of my own drum.Burton stocks tees, hoodys, jeans, nice shirts and all at very reasonable prices, the staff in this branch are also very friendly and the few times I've popped in with guy friends they've always left with something.
