4	Right beside Easter Road stadium lies a hidden gem in Edinburgh. A beautiful little park with a big pond running parallel.Lets start with the wonderful view. You can see for miles up into the hills and get a great view of Arthur's Seat (not that it's hard to miss).It's smack bang in the middle between the cIty and the sea, so you get the fresh salty air but none of the seaguls shitting on you.Some locals give it a very bad reputation due to some reccent stabbings, but lets be honest, what park doesn't frighten an OAP? The only time you have to avoid is it is when the football is on, unless conversation with winos is your thing. Go on a nice sunny day and enjoy one of the best alternative views of Edinburgh you'll ever see.
3	As a park this place is steeped in both potential and disappointment and it really should do much better than it does.  Its okay for a quick trip to the swings, but it should really be one of the best parks in Edinburgh.Its setting cannot be faulted; it surrounds a lovely loch and is backed by Arthur's Seat so on paper it should be something quite stunning and a great place to sit and relax on a summer's day.However, when you get here you will usually be a bit disappointed.  It's not full of litter, but there are occasional items of debris like a trolley in the loch that spoil it.  I can't help but feel that if it was treated better and maybe contained a few shrubs or flowers that it could be perfect - as it is it's just a big letdown.
