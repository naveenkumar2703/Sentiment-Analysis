3	I am a weekly customer of this frys.  I use the Bank of America located inside of it, and all facets of frys.  I prefer to shop here than at other stores - it has a good hometown feel to it. There isn't much that is special about the frys, it has a standard layout, no special features, maybe even a bit dated in its dsign - but they provide great specials, good variety, good bakery.  I am there all the time - dig it.
4	I have been here on a couple of occasions to buy donuts for my coworkers. Today I actually went grocery shopping here. I was very happy with their fruit selection and their customer service. I don't have a Fry's card but the lovely lady behind the counter gave me the discounts anyway. I will be going here again for my grocery needs.
2	The new Fry's in the burbs are awesome, but this old relic is pretty bad. Ugly with a with a smaller selection, plus staff who pass you in the aisles (when you're obviously looking for something) without asking if they can help. If you're in this neighborhood, head over to the nearby Safeway.
