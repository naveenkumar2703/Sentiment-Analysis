5	For some time, my idea of an absolutely perfect lunch was to go to vintage market, get a great salad, a plate of cheese and fruit and a bottle of wine.  On a great weather day, sitting outside and watching the people stroll by, there isn't much better.  Mind you, you can't do that often, but it's wonderful when you can.  It's the closest I've seen for feeling like you're sitting at a Paris market outside a busy street.  They have great sandwiches too.  And if you aren't in the mood for my ideal lunch fantasy, they can still help you pick out a great glass of wine to go with your sandwich before you run over to see a move at Esplanade.  Or, buy a whole bottle of wine to enjoy after the movie.  I've always been given great assistance in picking out the perfect bottle.  I can almost taste it now....
3	Great place to sit and drink wine on a Saturday afternoon where you have nothing better to do. Food's average. Lots of people watching which I  love. No indoor seating though so avoid when hot.
