1	I went in on July 20th with my Mother.  The store is lighting is nice, loved the sales and that's where it ends.  The assistant manager, Tammy,  clueless.The organization/flow of the store was peculiar.  There were 2 registers but no designated line.  When I stepped in line, there was another lady in line behind the other cashier and I stood behind the other.  When the register was free on my side, I let the other lady go ahead of me.  Afterwards though, I stood in line for 5-6 mins and stepped out of line to look at the clearance rack next to the other register.  When I was done, another lady stepped in line on the side I was previously standing on so I stepped in line on the other side.  So we were standing in line for about 10 mins and the lady working the register in the line I'm in, looks up at the other lady and tells her she'll be right with her.  That lady pointed at me to acknowledge me.  The lady, the assistant manager, Tammy looked at the other lady and said, "they like to sneak in like that".  Rude!!!  You should never talk about customers in front of them.  NEVER.Shows how much she pays attention to her surroundings, considering I had been in line pretty much for 15-20 patiently waiting for them to finish.   How she made it to an Assistant Manager is beyond me.  Poor customer service and colorful choice of conversations to have with her co-worker with customers standing in front of her.
