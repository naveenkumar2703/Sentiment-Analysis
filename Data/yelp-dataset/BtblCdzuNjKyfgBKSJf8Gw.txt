1	Since I reviewed Nathan's I should review the exact opposite of a good hot dog joint.I do love the dogs.  One day in high school, my friends and I had a day where we did stuff that we'd never done before.  One of those things was go to a Wienerschnitzel.  I didn't like it then.I then married a man who LOVED Wienerschnitzel and would bring it home at every opportunity.  I then learned that I hate Wienerschnitzel.I've made better hot dogs at home on my grill much cheaper.  I don't know what they do to them - mayhap I don't have enough fake German in me to like them - but they've always tasted slightly of ass and cat food.
4	they take kinda long but that is because they make sure your corndogs are fresh and delicious.
4	I love weiners! The pastrami is pretty good too!
