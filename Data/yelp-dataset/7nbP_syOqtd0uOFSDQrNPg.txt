3	Cheaper upfront for gas than Terribles across the street after their discount
3	I didn't realize it until I after I started pumping, but it was $0.15 a gallon cheaper than the station across the street. Sweet!
3	We fancy this gas station for snacks and energy drinks during our breaks at school. Packs of Pima students crowd the store late mornings and early evenings so if you want to dodge the students in blue, reschedule your gas and snack pit stop away from those times.It's your typical Texaco with a great staff on hand whenever I've gone there. They're always understanding to our hundred some odd number of students whenever we show up. Other than the trend of lower gas prices from time to time, the staff is what makes the place shine! I recommend getting gas here for that extra boost of small talk with the cashiers
