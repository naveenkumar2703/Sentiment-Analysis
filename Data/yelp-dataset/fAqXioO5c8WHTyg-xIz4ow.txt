5	The difference between Wright Bet Auto Body and any other body shop in Henderson/Las Vegas is that the Scott, Frank and the Wright Bet team really care about their customers. Damaging my fender on my brand new 2012 Sonata left me frustrated and in need of a good body shop. Scott and Frank were very attentive to my needs and made sure I left as a satisfied customer. Their team does an excellent job at repairing and I am very happy with the outcome of my car. I would be more than happy to recommend Wright Bet to those in need of any type of car repair!
5	I can't thank Scott and his crew enough for their professionalism and taking the worry out of my car damage experience. Wright Bet Auto goes above and beyond when it comes to taking care of their clients and they stand behind their work. I felt absolutely catered to, made me feel at ease from start to finish. And my car looked even better than new :)This is the ABSOLUTE place to take your car to get fixed. Customer service at its finest :)
5	Fantastic service. Scott and his team at Wright Bet are excellent. My car was hit by another driver on my birthday and I was obviously not happy. Scott helped me through every step of the process from getting my estimate handled to even picking me up at the rental car location so I didn't have to wait. If you want service you can rely on and you enjoy working with professionals who treat you like a VIP; you can't lose with Wright Bet!!!
