4	Pre-K is more structured than our last one. My daughter doesn't enjoy it as much but at least she learns a little and gets to interact with other kids. The school itself is clean and the teachers are extremely nice.
5	My daughter loves going to preschool here.  It's very well organized, fun, and she has learned so much!  The staff is amazing.  I haven't met one person here who wasn't amazing, helpful and so caring.  We plan on staying at CGLS for the long haul!  GREAT place!!!!!!!
