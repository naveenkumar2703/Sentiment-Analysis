5	This place is great. I was in a jam and had to set up a memorial service for someone very close to me. We wanted to show old videos and pictures of my friend and no one else in town could get it done in the two day deadline. Not only was Nufilez able to get it done in time, but they also handled the situation with sensitivity. I would highly recommend Nufilez.
5	This place is awesome.  I first found them when I was trying to find someone to convert my old college football film to DVD and files I can watch on my computer.  They did such a good job that when I needed them to convert some photos to digital images for my business I thought of them.  The guys at Nufilez turned it around in next to no time and saved me a lot of time and effort.  Its a great deal for the money and saved me and my staff a lot of time.  Highly recommended
5	Wanted to get my moms family reunion VHS converted to DVD for a Christmas present, but I had never done the transfer before myself. I decided to look on Yelp and came across NuFiles. It was a home business but Mike was very professional. I was provided an order receipt (which most people fail to give). He was backed up from the orders during Xmas week, but had it all done within 3-5 days. I received the DVD disc and it blew away my expectations! The DVD video quality was fantastic, and it came with a personalized disc image! I had to pick up a blank DVD case from Best Buy, but I can't knock him for that. My mom absolutely loved it! As a bonus, Mike even sent the entire video to me on Google Drive!! That allowed me to immediately send a copy to family out of state. 10/10
5	In short, it was professional, good quality work, and I will definitely do business with nufilez again.We came in to transfer our wedding video from  a couple hd minidv tapes to dvd. This was the best company we find in Vegas. The process was quick and pleasant. We are going to do business with Nufilez again soon.
