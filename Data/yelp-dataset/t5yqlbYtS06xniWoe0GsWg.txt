2	I would prefer to not return to Buy Low.  I was going here for meat for my dog, cheap veggies (also for my dog) and my boyfriend likes the "mexican sweet bread".  But he will have to live without, and I will go to a different carniceria.  My first few experiences here were poor mainly because of very low customer service from the cashiers.  I figured, well if I worked at Buy Low I probably wouldnt be super happy and nice either.  But after my last experience with rude fellow customers along with the cashier, I will go somewhere else.Maybe you work at a lame place, but YOU chose to get that job, so have some damn respect.  Screw this place.
4	Very cheap, especially when it comes to vegetables and fruits. And they seem to cater towards the Mexican customers, so if you are into Mexican food, this is the place to go to.
4	I just started shopping at Buy Low and so far have been quite happy with each trip.  I usually stick to the national chains but since Buy Low is close to my apartment I thought why not.  The selection of produce is great and the prices are Low. 10lbs of potatoes for $1?  Hell ya!! I had to step out of my comfort zone at the meat department but the employees are always helpful and friendly.  I have gotten some great deals and the store is clean and organized.  I have yet to find one rude employee and defiantly find myself returning over and over.
