5	I've participated two team building workshops with the Hunkapi staff, and both times I was seriously blown away. I've done a lot of other team-building exercises, and they are enjoyable but not particularly helpful. This was completely different. Terra's insightful questions and direct observations took the experience to whole different level. It was also a blast!!To be more specific, it took me four years of therapy to realize that I struggle between two selves--a strong, empowered self and a accommodating, intimidated self. With the horses, this conflict became apparent right away, and I actually had the opportunity to practice overcoming my fear and being more assertive and in command of myself and my surroundings. When I got back home, I saw an immediate difference in my interactions with my family, my clients, and my friends. What an invaluable experience!

5	Terra and the staff are unbelievable. Hands down the best therapeutic program around. My autistic granddaughter has been going here for over 3 years and the progress has been fantastic.   I do not hesitate to recommend them to whomever will listen.
