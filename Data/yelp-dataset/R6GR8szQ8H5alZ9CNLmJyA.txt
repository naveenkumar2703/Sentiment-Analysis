3	I have been wanting to stop by one of these since I got here, in spite of the fact that they are a fast food chain.  The reason is because I remembered how good their oysters were.  I decided to get the 7 piece fried oysters and chips meal instead of just the 4 piece.  It was a whopping $4.50.  It was 50 cents extra for a 5 oz tarter sauce.  The oysters were as good as I remembered and I was glad I stopped.  The fries were a bit salty but still better than a lot of places.  I will definitely keep this on my must visit when in Arizona list.Menu @ http://www.piratesfishandchips.com/(4/23/09)
2	Ugh. It's just not very good and the service is lacking.Go a little further to Pete's Fish & Chips. It is worth it.
1	Food is absolute garbage. Came out stale and cold. A completely unsuccessful rip-off of Pete's.
1	Places like this should just close down. Horrible food...horrible service...the employee complained because I didn't call in my order for 2 crappy meals. You're better off taking the bun off a fish filet from mcdonalds and eating it with ketchup...nuff said.
3	This place closed down three months ago.
