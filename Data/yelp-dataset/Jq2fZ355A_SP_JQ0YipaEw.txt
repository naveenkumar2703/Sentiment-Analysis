4	This is the closest Walgreens to us and since we visit this location frequently, the staff recognizes us and even calls my husband by name.Redbox located outside. Ads are inside the store so if you forget your coupon, they're readily available for you to use right at the entrance.
1	I DO NOT WANT TO EVEN GIVE ANY STARS....This is the worst Walgreen's in Las Vegas!!! The staff is completely rude. The head pharmacist actually told me to doctor shop other physicians. The male head pharmacist thinks because doctorate in pharmaceuticals that he could obtain my private medical records without a signed release form. THAT'S COMPLETELY ILLEGAL. SO DO NOT LET THEM BULLY YOU INTO GIVING OUT YOUR PRIVATE MEDICAL RECORDS. They are just pharmacists and that does not equate to years of medical school. I will never go back there, he threatened and violated my rights. I don't want what happened to me to happen to any one else. DO NOT GO THERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE INSULTED, VIOLATED AND THREATENED.
2	I've been going to this Walgreens since its closest to where I live. The service is hit and miss , and when I go fill my prescriptions they tell me it'll be the next day , then I call later in the day and someone else tells me my prescriptions have been ready for a couple hours. Pretty annoying. Then the last time I went to fill my prescription , they tell me they are out of my prescription , and don't know when they'll get it ... Then just looked at me with a dead stare. Seriously wtf?! Walgreens won't be getting my business anymore, I went to them for years , and after my last few experiences I'm over it.
1	The drive through service SUCKS!!!! Always in line FOREVER. Why I keep going back, no idea. Literally in line at a drive through for at least 10 minutes every single time. Horrible.
