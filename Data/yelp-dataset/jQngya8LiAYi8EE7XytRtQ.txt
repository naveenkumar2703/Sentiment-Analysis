5	Haute Chix Boutique is an amazing place to go & find unique pieces that will flatter most figures and body types. I happen to live very close to the location in Southern Highlands but I always end up at this location because of work. Of all the times I have went, the staff has always greeted me upon entering and are more than helpful in helping me find something. Since this IS a boutique, if you like something, don't even think about it, just buy it. They will more than likely run out of your size quickly because these pieces are hand selected and only a few of every size is ordered. I like that. The only troublesome thing is that the dressing rooms here are more "open" than the other location and the fabric to cover you isn't thick enough to make me feel shielded from the public eye. - UPDATE: Thank you Selena for your comment on my review and I have to agree that I now feel safe and sound in there :)Come check them out :)
5	I seriously love this place! I feel like 90% of my wardrobe is from here and whenever I get compliments I automatically send them here. The only thing I wish is that they would get in more smaller sizes when they order shipments because a lot of the time the smaller sizes are sold out. But other than that I love everything about this place!
4	I LOVE the stuff they offer here but they should start ordering more SMALLS. There's only have MED LARGE and XL's when I come.  Not sure if I come too late but they should really stock up on more small sizes. Other than that, everything's really cute.
2	This boutique has a decent selection of clothing. Mostly club wear, which isn't what I was looking for. However, the girl behind the counter had no sales skills. When I asked her about another size she simply just said, "what we have is out." I think a skilled sales associate would get involved with the guest and ask if there was anything they could help find. She made no effort to convince me to buy anything. Probably won't come back!
