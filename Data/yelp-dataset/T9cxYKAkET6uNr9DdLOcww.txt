5	A true Insurance Brokerage with excellent customer service. I was tired of paying $160 a month of insurance for a beat up 98 Honda... Went to GLG and had Anna worked me up a few quotes. I was shocked at the savings but super happy that I finally had a company that would do the work to save me money!!! I have better coverage and a lower payment... She also was knowledgeable and eager to help me set up my life insurance. I am not only pleased with their services but also with their willingness to help. Thanks GLG for your help.
5	Highly recommend for all insurance needs. Very friendly staff and have great variety of insurance companies to deal with to get the best prices for auto, home and business insurance.I wouldn't go anywhere else for any of my insurance needs in Las Vegas!
