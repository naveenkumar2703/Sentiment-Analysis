5	Delicious sandwiches, and a delightful staff.The clock strikes noon.Your stomach beckons your attention.You think to yourself: "how bout a sandwich."You can never go wrong with a sandwich.For a good cold sandwich with no BS, stop by Big D's.
5	Friendly delicious sandwich shop...a great addition to downtown :)The owners run this store themselves, chop their own vegetables, and make your sandwich fresh.  The customer service is wonderful!These sandwiches have fresh bread, yummy meat, and lots of fresh chopped veggies (onions, pickles, tomatoes, green bell peppers, and olives) .  All sandwiches are 12" long so for the $6-8 cost they're a great value!  I never eat the whole sandwich but the best part about these is that the bread doesn't get soggy if you leave it in refrigerator overnight = 2 meals in 1There's even a little dining room if you want to eat out of the office.
2	I think this place is a myth. I've tried it three times and they're never open. I tried one week after the supposed opening, again a month later, and today which is about three months after opening. Each time involves a long drive from Henderson to check it out. The last try there was sign on the window that said they left town for the weekend and if you see the sign get a free bag of chips on Monday. Well, guess what? This was 11:30 on Monday! It's the last time I'll be making this drive, because not only is it a long one, but free parking is impossible to find.Too bad, I really liked the idea of bread, meats and cheese imported from back East - it had the potential for being something special.Just call ahead to see if they exist first.
