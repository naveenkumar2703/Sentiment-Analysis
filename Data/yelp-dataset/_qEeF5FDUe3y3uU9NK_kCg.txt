3	port of subs.....   sliced meat fresh in front of you to edge them out over subway....  They have changed their menus since I have last been in there....   I ordered a small Blackforest Ham with provolone on Wheat with spicy mustard... it was great and exactly what I was looking for for lunch.  I think the price was sub 4 bucks too which was also a bonus.   There was kind of a long line and it was understaffed considering the time of day it was (lunch)    all in all, it was a great experience and I would go back to this particular one again should I need a quick bite.
1	This is the 2nd Port of Subs I have dined in at and the service is not so great. The first location I went to was on 215/Decatur. Horrible service as well. I ordered the pulled pork BBQ sandwich. The sandwich maker didn't ask what kind of bread, rather she assumed I wanted wheat, she didn't ask if I would like t toasted. I notice the lettuce and veggies were old, brown and soggy so I asked if they had a new batch to serve and she said " no just cause it has a few browns in the lettuce, it's still good". I was like nevermind you ignored my question and just made my sandwich feel less appetizing. She went on to making 3 other people's sandwiches before asking if that's all i wanted and if I was dinning in or to-go. I just don't understand Port of Subs  employment standards but I think I'm going back to Eating Fresh at Subway!
