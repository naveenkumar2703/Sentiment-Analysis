5	Amazing performers...top notch. These swimmers knew exactly what they were doing, and boy, did they know how to put on a show. Can't wait to see them again.
5	The Water Beauties are the most talented, professional, and athletic group of performers I have ever seen. They truly add a "touch above" class to the world of Aquatic Art.  They have so many different types of styles. Each time I have seen them, they have something new and exciting. Looking forward to next time!!!
5	Water Beauties are as good as it gets! This amazingly talented group of athletes are the best and most precision water team I have ever hired!  I hired them to do a special routine for a huge corporate event held at the Wynn hotel and resort in Las Vegas. The client was thrilled and these girls delivered with style and grace. They were incredibly easy to work with, very creative and they have now become my "go to" water event team.   I will use them again and again. You should too. Steven DiamondBraunProductions.Com
5	Beautifully talented - and something really unique.  Amazing what they can do.  If they are performing near you.... highly recommended you checking them out.
5	Beautiful, talented, an absolute pleasure to work with and generally just great people to be around. Doesn't get much better than that. If I had my way the Water Beauties would be on our cover every week.Ryan OlbryshCreative Director, Vegas Seven Magazine
5	We visited this theater on the first day of the year. It was a holiday and so we had no problem with traffic. The place is beautiful. We were lucky to meet a Ukrainian who told us about its history. Expensive project, planned by the wife of Walter Water Beauties, a strong and determined woman. The acoustics are amazing. It is worth knowing!
