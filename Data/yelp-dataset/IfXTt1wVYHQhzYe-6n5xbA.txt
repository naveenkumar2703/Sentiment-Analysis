5	i like this one better than the one on mckellips, it's not always jam packed full of people (like me) wanting cheap smokes.the cashiers are grumpy (which i sometimes enjoy) and there's just a certain special quality to the entire shop.  they also have a drive up window!if you smoke, go here.
5	This location KICKS SO MUCH ASS. It's chill, the people are friendly, AND they actually have more tobacco products, and supplies than the big location at Mckellips and Hayden... (at that location, everyone seems to be treated like THEY ARE a shoplifter.) It's worse than going to BestBuy!
4	Being a smoker the prices are the cheapest!
4	Slightly shady location, but still cheaper and less crowded that the competing smoke shop up the street. Get better signage guys! We almost miss them every time.
