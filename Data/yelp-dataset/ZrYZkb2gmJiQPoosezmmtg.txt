4	Location, location, location.The reason this Starbucks is the only corporate coffee shop I frequent on a regular basis is because it's located on the first floor of Waterstones. There's big windows that flood with sunshine in the spring and summer and lovely views over Princes Street Gardens. The thing that wins me over however, is the coffee shop is surrounded by tables and bookcases packed with brightly coloured volumes of hard and paperback books. There's art, photography, film and travel volumes but the real draw is the mouth-watering selection of food and drink books. Providing you're careful and don't leave sticky fingermarks, the staff don't seem to mind you browsing through books as you sip your cappucino. Oh and the flat white and Americanos here aren't bad either!
