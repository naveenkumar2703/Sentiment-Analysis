4	I've stayed at two Travelodge hotels while visiting Edinburgh and I must say that I like this one the best. Travelodge hotels can barely be called hotels. They're one step up from a hostel. Be sure to know this going in because you might be disappointed by the amenities. They don't offer free wifi or any kind of toiletries. Just a bed, linens and instant coffee. But for me, this was the perfect solution. I was out and about all day in Edinburgh with little to no time in the hotel room. Who needs the frill? The lady at the front desk was helpful. The room was spacious. The building had character. It was a cheap place to stay, probably cheaper than a hostel because you don't have to pay per person. And bathrooms ensuite. Next time I'm on a vacation on a budget, I will definitely consider looking into the Travelodge in that city!
