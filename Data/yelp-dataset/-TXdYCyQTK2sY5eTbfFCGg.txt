5	I've used Capitol City Auto several times over the last year for repairs on my 1970 Pontiac GTO.  They did an excellent job and kept me updated on their progress.  They also work on modern day cars too (most of their business is just this).Very fair prices, and I plan to bring them more of my business in the future.
5	I called around for estimates for fixing a burned-out brake light, and Capitol City gave me the lowest estimate and invited me to stop by that afternoon. In less time than it took me to finish writing a shopping list--10 minutes at most--he fixed the problem. It was a great price and fantastic service: I never once felt foolish that I couldn't fix this problem myself, which is more than I can say for other places I've been. The atmosphere of the shop is pristine and comfortable, and is the sort of place I would be happy to wait for an hour (though I doubt I will ever have to).
