5	A cute little salon with the nicest stylists. Krista is great, so good at what she does, and patient enough to blow out straight my curly long hair! Thanks girl! I'll be back soon!!
5	This salon is so great!  I have been seeing Krista for a few years now, and she does a wonderful job!  She is really really really good at color - they are very reasonably priced.  The girls are super friendly too
