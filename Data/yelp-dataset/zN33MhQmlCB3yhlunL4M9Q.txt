1	I know this isn't Burger King where you make it my way BUT when I ask for NO mayo and you say OK, I assume you are confirming that you understand and are acknowledging that there will be NO mayo on my sandwich.I really don't see how it can be so difficult to make a handful of burgers.I mean the place is dead-nobody inside or  in the drive-thru.I really have low expectations of the food here but I've come to expect so much more of the service -after all this is the only fast-food place in the chinatown neighborhood where most everyone speaks english.I used to count on this place for midnight munchies with some deep-fried tacos for $1 but now I'm just too pissed too go back!!!
1	Nothing has changed. Still sucks! I should have read my own review before going back.
5	I've always liked eating at Jacks! The menu is affordable! I like this location they have the best customer service, I believe the drive through person is Carlos, that guy is awesome and goes above and beyond to make sure customers are satisfied. Thank you for your awesome customer service!!!!
3	There drive-thru is really slow late at night but there new late night combs are so yummy.
1	If no stars was an option, it would happen. I ordered my food, pulled up to the window and before I handed over my payment I saw a roach on the wall. Took a picture(which I will post) and told the cashier. She looked, shrugged her shoulders and said"not the first person to say something". I get it, you work minimum wage and flip burgers for a living. But in any restaurant, cleanliness should be priority.
4	Came for the awesome shakes & fries. We usta come here sit at the front window & watch cars & ppl. But there were too many transient ppl here slummin & loitering. Came here today tables clean, quiet, organized & helpful. I ordered the vanilla shake real thick & flavorful. Gson got the strawberry shake he could barely get the thick ice cream through the straw. The fries were crispy on the outside yummy on the inside.
