4	Framing job delivered on time, friendly & enthusiastic staff. Will go back.
5	Very fair prices, a fantastic selection, super-friendly and helpful staff, quality work, and appropriate timelines make Middleton Art and Framing a no-brainer when it's time to get important stuff ready to hang on the wall. The Wife and I have used them several times now, and we love everything they've done for us!
5	Awesome place. They did a fantastic job framing my piece of work. When I got home, I found a small misalignment. I took it back and they fixed it (even better than I had in the first place). They added some extra stuff to it and put a wire on the back for free. I love this place and will always go back.
5	Excellent service, reasonable prices. I bought a less expensive stock frame and they mounted it for me while I waited. Very happy.
