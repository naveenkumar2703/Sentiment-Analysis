5	Average QT had to come here since the one on 99th the chase ATM was not working
5	Friendly staff. Clean restrooms. Large selection of hot and cold drinks. Staff always seems to be cleaning something and they can move customers through long lines quickly.
5	Holy Smokes! They have a full kitchen here! I didn't notice that until now, the cashier said they just got it in like, 3 weeks ago. Spiffy.. Fresh food 24/7 even better! Keeps getting better!
