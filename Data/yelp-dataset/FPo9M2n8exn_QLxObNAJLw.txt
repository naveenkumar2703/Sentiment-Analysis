4	It's a Krispy Kreme Doughnut shop with a Caribou Coffee attached. I'm not a huge doughnut fan, but the GF likes them, and they give you a free doughnut if you come in when their big 'We're making doughnuts!' sign is lit. And we do love free things. The Caribou Coffee is outstanding. A bunch of different flavors, posted nutritional booklets (which I love), free wifi (if you're the type to sit and write in coffee shops), seasonal items, and best of all, a trivia contents where if you get it right it's ten cents off your order. I know, ten cents isn't really much, but I love trivia. I forgot to mention that it also has 'lodge' decor which I'm a fan of, so if you've ever spent time in cabins or hunting camps, it'll bring back some memories. The smells are just different; coffee, as opposed to the woods.
5	This place is so delicious I wish they still had a Krispy Kreme in Chicago!
5	You can never go wrong with KK, especially one open for 24 hours.
4	Not a huge doughnut fan, but Krispy Kreme always gets to me. Most especially their chocolate cake and original glazed ones.This is a good and 24-hr to-go-to food kiosk when you're hungry in the heart of Circus Circus.
