4	I've been half ogling Le Creuset for a few years (Cook's Illustrated rated as best dutch oven for braising) but the prices are outrageous...But I was on my way up to Flag, so why not randomly peruse the outlet.  Apparently the factory store runs a theme sale each month, and the color I wanted was on sale (cherry red, last month was blue and yellow).  The sales guy was so kind, he checked all the inventory so I could piece out the best lid and oven combo and feel confident in my "factory seconds" purchase.  Basically just some minor scratches, though there was one that was missing a huge piece of enamel...  This might be leading down a path of expensive cookware... but at least I'll call ahead to see what color is on sale if I'm making the drive...
5	I love le crueset products....quality enamaled cast iron pots and pans. I received a set as a wedding gift, and they are still good as new 8 years later. They are expensive, especially to buy a set, however, that is why this outlet store is so great!!! They have pretty much every color they've ever come out with, including stoneware products (casseroles, pie dishes, etc.) and all for a discounted price (maybe ranging from a 15-30% discount from retail). They recieve the overstocked and sometimes discontinued items. They also stock "second rate" pots that maybe have a small factory default. Every month they have different sales, usually going by color (for instance, the purple and kiwi colors may go on discount for the duration of one month) You can sign up for emails, that way, if there is a particular color you would like to add to your collection, you can keep on the watch for when it will go on discount.
