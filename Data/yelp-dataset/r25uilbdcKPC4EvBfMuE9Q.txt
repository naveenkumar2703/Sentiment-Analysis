1	THIS PLACE IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!! I took my clothes here to  be dry cleaned and when I got them back they didn't even look like like they were touched. They were dirty, unpressed and my black garments had hair all over them! My Dryel kit can do a better job then these people can. Don't think your saving money with their $1.99 any garment deal...cause they don't do anything to your clothes. Id rather spend more money and get the job done right...this place is a joke!!!
4	This place isn't the nicest. The staff here aren't the friendliest. Actually, it honestly feels like they're not even trying. However, for $1.99 for a piece of clothing (used to be $1.25 or $1.75, still not bad), I'm not complaining.Everything I've brought in here were nicely cleaned and pressed/steamed by the time I got it back. Nothing got lost, a button didn't magically disappear, etc. Honestly, every time I visit Vegas, I pack as much clothing that needs to be dry cleaned so I can have it cleaned here. Why bother having it cleaned somewhere else here when it's going to cost more, right?
5	I been using this dry cleaner location for 3 years now, weekly. I never had an issue. Staff is great, always ready to help.  I actually can't recall a time I had to wait to be helped. My coworkers had their dry clean uniform switched out with someone else's in different store that they pay 4.50$ each piece. Which I dont see how that can happen so I highly recommend them to come to this location. I never had this issue.My wife also uses this location for all her dry cleaning needs, if there are items that can't be cleaned, staff politely leave a note stating they tried and just didn't work, which is understandable, sometimes stains or discoloration have an effect on dry cleaning. For the price and service, can't beat it!Shout out to Louie!
