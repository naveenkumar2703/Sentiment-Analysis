4	A really helpful store located in a awkward little corner of the city.They have a varied selection of everything you would find in B&Q for roughly the same price. I was looking for No More Nails and saved 25p in here. The staff are helpful and don't make you feel like an idiot for asking questions like "it looks like hook, but with the wee bent  bit at the bottom".
4	I came here for a very specialised screwdriver for my laptop.  The sales staff were incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and sarcastically fun.  I was trying to decide between the more expensive one and the less expensive one.  You would expect a store to try and convince you that you need the more expensive one.  This was not the case.  They figured if i was only going to use it once I should go with the less expensive one.  Which I did.  The screwdriver worked perfectly for my needs.  The prices were higher than homebase, but tools from homebase had their screwdriver's head strip. ( Yes the screw driver stripped not the screw. ) They were clearly made of cheap metal.  Homebase also had much less selection.  Thank you Murray's Tool!
4	There are occasions where you need something from a genuine hardware store that you simply cannot buy elsewhere.  This is one of those shops where the tradesmen are the main customers and for the purposes you will need, many of the tools here are too expensive and of unnecessarily high quality, though you will find tools that cannot be found elsewhere.  What it is great for and what I use these sorts of shops most of all for is buying nuts and bolts.  Buying bolts elsewhere isn't too hard to do, but buying an M1 nut from anywhere else is almost impossible, from here it will set you back about 10p. Any small parts that you need to fix something should be found here and you simply do not get these sorts of parts at somewhere like Homebase anymore; they are more interested in lawnmowers and Hoovers now.
