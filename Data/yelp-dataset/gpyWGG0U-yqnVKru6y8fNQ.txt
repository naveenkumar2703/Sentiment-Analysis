5	This is a very special medical practice with customer service and attention to detail that you hardly ever see in a doctor's office anymore. I started seeing Dr. Ross for Osteopathic Manipulation after having a few back surgeries. He has given me tremendous relief and I highly recommend OMT rather than chiropractic treatment since it works with the tissue and muscles as well as the bones. Anyways, He listens and takes time to treat your WHOLE body unlike most doctors that have one hand on the door knob as they speak to you. I saw a Naturopath in the past and saw Cheryl the P.A. for the first time the other day. She took a lot of time with me, going through my blood work line by line. I was so please that she suggested supplements and knew about things that I learned from the Naturopath...but actually, she knew about more supplements than the Naturopath! So I was really pleased. This is a great office and everyone is like family....they also treat you like you are a part of their family. They make your children feel comfortable too. There are tons of Mickey Mouse figures and videos for them to watch. The nurses have always loved on my daughter since she was a baby. They make sure that all of us have a productive appointment! I highly recommend this office.
