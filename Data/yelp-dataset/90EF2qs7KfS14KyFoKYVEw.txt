3	I love Michael Kors so I was excited to see what they had to offer at this outlet store. I was hoping to find some good deals on watches and such. Sadly, I did not find the deals I was looking for. The best items were the same prices that they are in the Michael Kors Stores or at Nordstrom, so making the trip here would not be worth the long drive out. I would just save gas and suck it up and buy it at Fashion Square. Luckily for me, I was out in the area when I came to scope it out. No harm, no foul.
5	2nd Time at this location. Wonderful store with amazing customer service. The store is clean, organized and easy to get through. This store is in an outlet location so there are some super duper savings. The sales reps are non pressure individuals who are very helpful. This store has a wide variety of handbags, wallets, technology accessories and a small section of clothes.
4	Thanks to this store I am obsessed with MK clothes. The bags are plentiful but I must take away 1 star for not having more selections of bags with bigger handles.  I need substantial handle for all the junk I carry in my purse.  Otherwise the clothes is gorgeous.
