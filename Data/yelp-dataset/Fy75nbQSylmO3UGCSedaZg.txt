4	While it is kind of hard to find, its definitely worth the trip, especially if you are looking for denim.  Jodi, the owner, is extremely knowledgeable about style, fit, and wash.  (Amber, the co-owner is also very nice and very personable) I am not a denim person at all so Jodi's help was greatly appreciated.  They carry a wide selection of lines, most of which you would be hard pressed to find elsewhere.  (People's Liberation, William Rast) The selection is well chosen, in addition to the denim there are great dresses and fun tops that will fill out the rest of your closet.  While trendy is the prevailing style here it ranges from feminine to edgy.  Girls, you can bring your man with you too because they also stock men's merchandise!  The shop may be small but is the type of place where you will get individual attention and walk away with some very unique items.
4	The selection is small, but what they have is good. First, I am biased because Spoken is within walking distance from my house. That automatically makes me excited about it. Second, they carry a lot of dresses, and I heart dresses. So bonus points there.Another great thing is the mixed price point of the clothing. They carry dresses for $200 - $500 but also have a great selection of Free People and Kenzie for just under $100. I've only been there once but I'll be sure to check it out again and again. Will update my review.
4	From a man's perspective:  I've gone into Spoken several times on various first fridays but I had never gone in with the intention of buying anything until just before Christmas.  I accompanied my girlfriend who entered with the intention of buying a new pair of jeans.  The girls that were there were extremely friendly, helpful, and informed.  They know their products and they know how to sell them.  It was not high pressure sales but at the same rate they were very attentive.  I browsed the men's section giving my opinion whenever is was required.  And my girlfriend found her pair of People's Liberation jeans and I've honestly never seen a girl happier after suffering a major hit to her purse.  Ha...I actually didn't understand it, but SPOKEN is definitely doing something right.Later, for Christmas, I received a shirt I had noticed in there by Ames Bros. I love the shirt and I better understand what it is about to have a piece of clothing that you LOVE.
5	Spoken Boutique has saved my fashion life! All of the items I have purchased from Spoken had definitely moved me much more fashion forward.  Amber and Jodi have helped me create a whole new look from casual to dressy! They have encouraged me to try new looks and have always been honest about what works and what doesn't! I love the vibe in the store and appreciate the amazing customer service they provide. Black Halo, Nicole Miller, and Liquid are some of the great lines I have purchased.  They also have FANTASTIC denim and funky tee shirt collections! I have two favorite places to shop and Spoken tops that list!
5	Expensive. Small. Filled with talent.Walked in with a ten minute browsing mentality, on our way to the airport to head back home to CA, we stopped off to buy a cupcake next door...and spotted this ultra-cute spot. Absolutely NO intention to buy anything...but I can't pass up a boutique crawl.So how did we rush out 15 min later with two pairs of butt-hugging William Rast jeans for him and two extremely sassy dresses for me?? The fabulous female duo that runs this place! They got talent. Quickly dressing my hub in what looks good on him, and tossing me a pair of heels to go with the dress I was modeling in front of the 3way, they knew how to make the most of the short time we did have and make it work. Dresses 50% off and jeans lookin' way too hot, my wallet lost the battle with my inner fashionista. I wish these ladies had a shop near me....they had ridiculously cute stuff and tons of it.Wait, my bank account says maybe not. But anyway, Happy 5 Year Anniversary to us...we deserve a splurge!
4	Love the vibe in this small and trendy store.  I could drop major bank in here; this store is pricey but it can compete with any NYC boutique with what they are selling.  Cute stuff and very hip :)  Gotta go back when I have some cash to blow through.  Dresses for $450 and tops for $125 be prepared to dig deep in your pockets...It's good stuff though.
5	I love Spoken! The chicks that run it, Amber and Jodi are awesome. Wish I had more money to spend therrrrrrrrre. They are always stocked with super cute clothes.
5	I will start with a confession: I am a bit of a clothes whore. Straight male, likes buying clothing, BUT I am *terrible* at pairing clothing. I usually like to bring someone with me. Inevitably I try to bring Dallas G as the man has an eye. There is a part of me that feels weird asking another man for his opinion on how a shirt or a pair of jeans look, but I digress. I have been wanting to check out Spoken for some time now and decided to today. I picked up Dally for our excursion. Spoken is a small boutique on Roosevelt next to Tammie Coe. On this day the selection was not huge, but everything was 50% off. Amber, the owner, was there to help me pick out clothes. They carry a number of different designer jeans and shirts. Per the usual there are more for the women then men, but there is ample to select from. I tried on a few button ups, but I was Goldilocks today and couldn't find one that fit quite right. Didn't get a chance to try on any jeans, but do I really NEED another pair? I have been looking for a blazer and found one I liked. Amber helped me pair it with a tee and it looks awesome. Can't wait to wear it out. I have never been into a shop like that before and it was awesome having Amber there for advice. I gave her a hard time for saying everything looked good because she wanted me to buy, but she did let me know when something just didn't work. Check this place out when you can.
5	Stop what you're doing right now and get your ass over to Spoken. I don't care that you're at work. 98% of this gorgeous little boutique is 50% off, now MOVE MOVE MOVE!!!Okay, now that we've gotten that out of the way, I'll let you in on a little secret. I have bought every single "special occasion dress" as I like to call them over the last 5 months there. A big first date dress, 2 birthday dresses (yes, I dig an outfit change,) a theater cocktail dress, literally, you name it, Spoken's got it and I've bought it.Spoken has two very kick ass things going for it. For starters, they have clothes for every budget. What I mean by that, is if you want to spend $300-$400 on a dress, you can, and it'll be gorgeous. That said, you can also spend under $100 on a dress and it will be just as gorgeous. **Note, with the sale going on right now, go get your True Religions, your Citizens of Humanity and a million other top tier designers for lower prices than I've ever seen.The other thing that sets Spoken apart from other boutiques I shop at is the store owner Amber. When I say homegirl knows what she's doing, I mean homegirl is on point!! She's fantastic. Let's me roam around the store picking things out myself, but by the time I get into the dressing room, she has an entire additional stack of clothes that she has selected just for me. And guess which stack I end up buying, yup, the one she picked out. She's got an eye for style and body type like I have never seen. Things that hanging on the rack I never in a million years would have grabbed for myself, are now some of my favorite and best-fitting dresses/tops etc. And I'd also like to mention that if it doesn't fit/look right, she'll tell you before you can even get both feet out of the dressing room.All in all Spoken is a GREAT local business run by a knowledgeable and helpful fashionista. Such cute stuff and only a handful of each garment so you don't have to worry about running into 75 people around town all wearing your same outfit, which whatever, call me a snot, I FUCKING HATE!!And yes, you can bet your ass if you see me running around Yelp in Bloom tonight, I will be in yet another of Amber's fabulous hand-picked pieces.
5	Still 5 stars, but sadly Amber is closing up shop.  Don't feel bad for her as it is not for the lack of business.  She is getting married and leaving the state and taking Spoken with her.  Damn her!!!  I did pick up some jeans and 3 shirts, all at 60% off.  So hurry over and pick up some bargains!  And wish Amber good luck!
