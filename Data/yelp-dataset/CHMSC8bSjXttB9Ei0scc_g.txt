5	There are no reviews for La Carreta De Lily. Am I surprised? HECK NO!If you want to taste desserts that are literally unlike anything you have ever tasted in your life, take a trip to La Carreta De Lilly! I am so hooked on this place I MUST go at least once a week (usually Sundays) to get my fix! They sell "raspados" with a twist. "Raspados" are shaved ice mixed with fruit flavor. La Carreta De Lily has various ways of serving it. My favorite is the "Chemix" which is strawberry raspado topped with vanilla ice cream. Over the ice cream is chunks of bananas and strawberries and pecans (requested by me), They have an array of drinks and flavors, your best bet would be to check it out for yourself! It's in a hidden location and the menu items are almost completely foreign- however the drinks are AMAZING and you will feel extremely privileged to have discovered such an amazing place. Summer time + Raspados = BLISS.Yes, BLISS people. BLISS. (It's THAT good).
4	This neveria is a pretty good place - not my favorite dessert establishment, but certainly passable. On the downsides, the location sort of sucks, and the ordering process is confusing and weird.  I had to get some clarification of what was what, and what options I had.  On the upside, this is not your average neveria and odds are if you can dream it up, it is on the menu. All in all, a good place, but not great.
