5	I love love love balaros. My mom met elmira, the owner, when she was pregnant with me and I have been there ever since. I drifted once and had my hair destroyed but Mrs myra fixed me! Tamika is my stylist now and she never disappoints! She gave me cold.fusion extensions and I love them. I was also a hair model for felicia and she made me into a lion and dang was I FIERCE!! Everytime I need a cut, color, or style I can go to any stylist and they never disappoint!! If ur new.in town or looking for a new stylist go here!! And what I love is not only do they take care of my hair but they instruct me on how to take care of it myself. And yes people...they do all hair types!!!
5	Been going here for years and always great service!  Love the hair dressers!  They have saved my hair sooooo many times! Anytime I try out a new place I always come back to them to fix whatever the other salon did lol!  Never going anywhere else but here!  Thank you! :D
4	I just visited today and calling around and I am very pleased with my hair. I just moved here and it is hard finding new EVERYTHING! I visited this place based on proximity to my home and the other review. I'm glad I did. Johnele (I think that's how it's spelled) and the other ladies were so nice. It truly felt like a family. The price was great too. I will be back!
5	Always accommodating, wonderful group of people.  Knowledgeable about hair.  I came here and Elmira took care of my weave and helped my natural hair grow past shoulder length so I don't have to wear a weave anymore.  The people in the shop are good with natural and processed hair!  Thank you!
