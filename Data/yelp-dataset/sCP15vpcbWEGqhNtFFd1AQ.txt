4	I really rate this pub, and wish I lived closer to it than I actually do. I used to live near Morningside, hence my familiarity with the area's public houses, however I'm now a wee bit far away, and the Morningside Glory is just that wee bit further away from even the central part of Morningside, so it's a bit of an effort to get to.Saying that, it is a good pub, and it would probably prevent me from getting jaded about Edinburgh watering holes if I stepped outside of my Stockbridge/New Town laziness perimeters for a change.  I like the old school, slightly art deco look of the interior of the Morningside Glory (keep wanting to call it Morning Glory, but clearly that wouldn't be appropriate...tee hee) and its mix of tradition and style. It's sort of in between a bar and a pub, which is a vibe I like. A good place to relax of an evening, and I like their shimmery, candle lit, so evidently flattering lighting scheme.
3	John Leslie drinks here, remember him? Oh and the nachos are quite good...This is a decent all round boozer, I quite enjoyed my first visit here, and a bit of B-List celebrity spotting made it that little bit more exciting. Service was good; they were attentive and trusted me to open a tab as soon as I came in. brought menus over quickly. We were in a rush so I just ordered some Chicken Nachos at the Bar. they came within ten minutes and were very good indeed!!  A broad range on the menu also.The decor is standard, sort of half living room half bar, and they have a couple of TVs showing live sports etc. It was quite busy for a Sunday afternoon and not many spare tables, which is a good sign. Like I said, it is a good all rounder, nothing amazing but worth a visit if you are in the area..
