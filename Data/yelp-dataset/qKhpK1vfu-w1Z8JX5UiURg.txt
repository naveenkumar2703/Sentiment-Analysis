1	Movers-not good. Maybe because it was in the 100's and it was in afternoon? They were extremely rude and were kindof slow-we couldn't help but compare them with our loaders in California-night and day. Would never recommend them.
5	We used Az Best on time movers for our move from Scottsdale Az to East Bay San Francisco and were 100% happy.  Our house was a 4,000 sq ft home with a ton of heavy furniture. They were so carefull and considerate with everything. They were quick, experienced and knew how to pack tight without jeopardizing the belongings. Chad the owner, Levy, Marcus, and the other guy were very trustworthy and made the move as pleasurable and lease stressful as could be. Thanks guys!!!
1	AZ Best On-Time Movers damaged and scratched several of our furnishings.  I am not unreasonable and understand that accidents happen;  However they would not return my calls or do anything to resolve the issues.  Truly horrible customer service.
5	I have used them twice and will do so again.  Great crew both times.  They did an outstanding job of efficiently using the moving truck space so only one trip was necessary.  Make sure you get enough guys on your crew.  I recommend a minimum 3 person moving team so 2 or 3 can carry constantly and 1 stays busy packing the truck.  I found them via uhaul.com where they have a record of hundreds of moves and a 5 star rating.  I highly recommend them.
