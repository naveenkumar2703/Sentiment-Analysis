3	Not bad as far as Subways go, clean setup, food tastes typical Subway, parking not bad.  Surprisngly though a lot of riff-raff customers for the area.  /sigh
5	Cheap, fast, and consistently delicious...definitely a regular stop for students in the area.
1	I've had Subway many times before moving to Arizona so I know they have good sandwiches. However, I will never eat at this particular Subway. My husband ordered two Turkey sandwiches to go and it was literally the worst sandwich I ever had in my life. Stale bread, and something definitely funky with the turkey, cheese, and lettuce. Like they used old ingredients.  I was sharing my sandwich with my 3 year old but after tasting it, I threw it in the garbage because I was afraid that we were going to get sick. Will not try anything from there again.
1	We just walked in and then walked right out! The employee that was working was coughing and sniffing and snorting all over the food!!
1	I told the employee I would like extra cheese 3 times and I ended up with double meat. I was the only customer in there and she seemed distracted. When I got home i took a bite and thr bread just crumbled into pieces. I will never return to this subway again.
