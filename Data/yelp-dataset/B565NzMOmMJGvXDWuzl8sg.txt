4	Just a small counter located just inside O'Sheas Casino, you can get pretty good discounts on just about any show or exhibit in Vegas (for that same day; thus the name).  They have several other locations as well, but this one just happened to be the most convenient.  There's usually a line, and you have to wait outside in the sun, but they have employees that try to help you decide on shows while you wait.  They'll try to sell you discounts on restaurants as well.Five stars for helping us save some dough, minus one star for making us wait outside in the desert heat.

5	IF you do not know about this place than you've overpaid for your show tickets the entire time you have visited Vegas. Now I want to set the right expectations about this place...YOU will NOT get front row seats, its not their business model... what is however is offering an 25% or less discount off pretty much all shows in the rear seating on ALL of the show's and some dining locations. My saving for Penn and Teller were the best value I received. I was told the show might possibly not sell out during my visit so the likelyhood that my ticket will be upgraded is highly likely. And though this might not be the norm... I sat 5 rows from the front!Cirque du soleil, and blue man groups were slightly higher but still had great viewing areas for the price.5 stars, a must go to for same day shows!
