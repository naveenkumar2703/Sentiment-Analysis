1	Quality of wash and services are terrible ..after 20 years the amount of rework is to the point it's not worth it.. sorry Vicky
1	Cost $40 to wash my 12' box truck. They said it would be hand washed and dried. The wash was ok but truck was not dried. Dripping wet it sun dried w water spots on glass and mirrors. They dont do any interior glass etc. total waste of money. I had to clean truck again myself after dannys. Dont waste your money here its essentially a dude w a hose and ladder that will do a wrinse and done in 5 min.  Given how their car washes are ( quality) and the cost i was pretty shocked by the lack of value. You know those fund raiser car washes done in parking lots? Thats this place but its covered. At least w the fund raiser car washes they dry your car.
1	This place pretty much sucked. It took forever and when our tanker cane out it still had soap all over it. It looked bettet when we came in. One gentleman out of tg e 10 that were working tried to make it righr...not a manager. The chrome shop was cool...if we had a Century I could have had anything under the sun, but we drive a Cascadia. Tge ladies inside were very nice and accommodating however, with a Blue Beacon next store...we will never come back to Danny's for a wash.
