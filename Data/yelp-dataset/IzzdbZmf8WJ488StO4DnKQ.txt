3	its ok, no pharmacy which is a bummer (go to the one on the capital its, better & has a pharamacy.  Its got what you need though, great convenience store really.  Watch for the cheap candy :-)
2	It's a rip-off for a simple passport photo. It's 12 bucks-- way too expensive for such a low quality passport photo!
1	This store was closed before the posted hours the last two times I went. We went to pickup a Redbox DVD and wasted the trip even though we got there 50 minutes before closing time.
2	A pretty nasty little Walgreens.
