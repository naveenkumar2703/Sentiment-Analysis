3	The selection is poor compared to your average grocery store (Sobey's, Zehr's, etc...), but on the whole the place is cheaper.Strangely enough, compared to Sobey's I'm more likely to find my vegan needs here. Nothing even slightly exotic like liquid smoke, for that you need the health/organic places, but the basics that I can't find at bigger places.That this place is so centrally located is also a boon, I can get food materials without leaving uptown.FWIW, the cashier staff is such that some recognize me as a regular. Also, one of the backline staff searched the entire dairy for vegan butter, and even made a note of it in case he was asked another time. That was nice of him.
3	3.5/5Located inside Waterloo Town Square, this place is good if you're looking for everyday food items at a student budget (like me). Don't expect anything fancy here (aside from maybe cheese). For those you have Zehrs, Sobeys, Vincenzos, and the kind alike.The cashiers here are nice and attentive. While I didn't shop during peak times, I do wonder with less than 10 cash lines would this place be busy during peak grocery shopping hours...This place does get good student traffic since it is located close to the universities and many of the student housing establishments.Students get 10% off Mondays. Show your ID!
2	No matter what, I'm always waiting in a long line. The cashiers move very slowly and will hold up the line for various reasons; wrapping a customer's 10 individual mums, chatting with a regular, etc. Really unpleasant experience.
