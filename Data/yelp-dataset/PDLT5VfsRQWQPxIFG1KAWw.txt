5	This dog park has a separate small/Big dog area, shade, benches, lights, and drinking water. Its well manicured. Its not overly spacious but if you have small/med sized dogs there is enough room for their legs to "unfold".
4	This is a well-manicured dog park. People clean up after their dogs.  It has the look and feel of a "small" dog park but there is plenty of space. It rarely gets crowded and there are two areas one for small and one for large dogs.  The facility includes: dog water fountain, benches, shade, trash, and poop receptacles. The rest of the park is nice and in a nice area.
2	Not the worst park as it is well-manicured. But, it is way too small and the small dog side has over-grown trees that limit access. People are nice in the morning. Water fountain is outside of fence, which is a bit inconvenient. Easier to just walk the dog in the much more spacious adjacent park.
3	This park is hidden in a residential area, so if you're not specifically searching for it, you will miss it.  It's a one-way road from the entrance so, again, be on the look-out for the park.  Parking is plentiful.Once you do get to the park, it's nice.  There are two runs, one for large dogs and one for small dogs, though the distinction here is 25lbs up or down while at other parks I've seen it's 35lbs up or down.  Anyway, the runs are long and fairly wide, and there is seating for the people.  The times I've gone it's always been very quiet, just me, the furball, and maybe another two or three people and dogs.  The people and dogs that I've run into have been really friendly though, so kudos to dog-park hospitality.  It's a solid dog park and it asks for returns, I just would like to have more dogs and people present.
