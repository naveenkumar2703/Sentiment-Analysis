5	I was super nervous to switch from tanning beds to spray tanning....I was worried I'd have streaks...spots....turn orange ....holy crap was I wrong!!!! I was sent to Stacey by a mutual friend ...I'll never lay in a harmful tan bed again!! The spray tan was super natural, faded like a real tan.... Slimming....etc!!!!! I'm hooked ....Stacey is super professional and made me feel super comfy!!!!
5	I've had many spray tans in the past, and I can definitely say that the spray tan I received from Stacey is the best. The product she uses is outstanding and gives you a natural looking glow. She is very knowledgable and makes you feel comfortable during the entire process.  If you want top quality, look no further!
5	Great tan great color and great wear off. I'll be back. Very professional and very knowledgeable. Glad I found her.
