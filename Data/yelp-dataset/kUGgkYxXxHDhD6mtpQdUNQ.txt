1	Just found hair in the pizza. Eww! Never again from this location will I order food, blah!
4	Ordering online was easy and service was fast and friendly when I arrived for pickup.  Everything I expect from Domino's.  Thanks pizza heroes!
5	Ordered another great deal from this location while studying for summer school exams last week.  Again another treat!  The staff is always very friendly here, my order is always right, and the pizza is always a good value.  Thank you for the continuing excellent customer service.
5	Domino's Pizza years ago was the butt joke of the century; nobody liked Domino's. The drivers were being pulled over for speeding due to them trying to uphold a 30 minute delivery promise and the drivers were many times involved in accidents and driving drunk. The pizzas were nasty tasting, flat and barely covered with toppings. But now, today, Domino's is off the chain! There was a time that I wouldn't even order a Domino's pizza, however today it is the only pizza that I will order. Please keep up the good work! I am a customer for life. Bring back the sweet cinnamon bread sticks with vanilla frosting as the topping.
1	My friend and I pulled into the shopping complex and decided to grab an iced tea at snoh, and then pickup a pizza at dominos. We parked in front of dominos (customer parking) but as we walked by our car, 2 employees started yelling and screaming at us. They were telling us not to park in front of the dominos because we weren't "customers". I told the female employee that we were going to grab a pizza to go, and she continued to yell at me like a psycho! This was completely uncalled for.  A company should not have employees that scream at customers. I will never go back to this location.
5	Outstanding service, outstanding quality and fantastic price.. These guys so smoke pizzaria muts. You guys rock 10th st and Camelback...... gonzo.
