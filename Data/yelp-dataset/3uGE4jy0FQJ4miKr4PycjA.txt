2	This is one of the very few food places near where we live.  While it's not a particularly great pizza place, it's not bad either.  There are tables inside and the staff is generally friendly.  They have a nice-sized LCD on one wall where patrons can watch whatever game is on.The pizza is serviceable, though not remarkable.  They serve lunch and have quite a few specials.  We probably get pizza from here once or twice a month.

We got some wings, a turkey sandwich, a gyro and a salad and they were all surprisingly good. Prices are in line with what you would expect and they only have a $1.95 delivery charge which is cool. My wife placed the order and said that the person on the phone was one of the nicest people that have taken a delivery order in general in a long time... so they get points for making the wife happy :)Definitely a good option for those "no way we're cooking" nights.
1	As stated in another post, I believe this has closed, and been replaced by Rivers American Grill, which i gave 4 star for good bar food.  Apparently they have pizza as well (guess they left the oven behind?).
