3	The staff here really are first class so I do feel a bit bad saying this, but the food on offer isn't quite as good as what you might get elsewhere and even though it isn't expensive I cannot recommend this as a place to get an easy dinner.Where it does do well, however, is with its convinience.  It's right on the bus stop, so if you're waiting for a bus it does seem very handy and will tempt you into a sale.I must admit, I've only ever been here at the end of a night out and at that point it generally does the job required of it, but it's nothing to write home about.
4	Oh my. The deep fried pizza here is amazing. The onion one is to die for. Like seriously. The chips were OK. The staff are friendly, quite jokes infact.
