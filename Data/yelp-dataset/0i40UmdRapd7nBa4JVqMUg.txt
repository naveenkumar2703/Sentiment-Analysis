4	I patronize this Starbuck's when I patronize Von's, or I should say that I patronize Von's when I patronize this Starbuck's. Von's did a well-done job designing their Starbuck's. Disparate from a handful of supermarket-managed Starbuck's, the seats are plentiful. Being the journalist and reader that I am, I appreciate the bright lighting. With their location, this is a good place for people watching, and running into people that I know.  The Von's that this Starbuck's is in is a laid back store. So this mood permeates into their Starbuck's.   I hope that Von's management appreciates their Starbuck's. It brings in people like me, that spend their money after their caffeine boost.
4	I love to shop and sip. This is a very convenient location and I rarely see a line. Very fast and easy.

4	There are little railings 'separating' this Starbuck's from Von's. Not many people would think twice about it, but it's actually very convenient--imagine all the shoppers and their carts constantly strolling through your seats. So, "well designed," indeed. My regular is a sweetened, grande Passion Tea Lemonade. The barista makes mine extra, extra sweet, and I'm pretty sure she does that because I'm a younger customer. No complaints here, it's delicious. Very friendly staff and it's always clean.
5	I was served by a male barista who didn't seem like he's happy to be at work. When I asked another female Barista to change my hot skinny vanilla latter to cold, I was treated differently by Tracy the Barista. We chatted a bit. Her smile was contagious. It made me want to smile while chatting with her. Thanks Tracy for being awesome!
