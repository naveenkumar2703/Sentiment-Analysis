4	I was given a tour of the Desert Mission Food Bank and some of the neighbor John C Lincoln buildings several weeks ago.  For whatever reason, I didn't think to yelp about it until now...The staff at Desert Mission Food Bank was extremely friendly.  Megan showed me around and gave me a history on how it came to be.  It's actually a fascinating story, but I will let you explore on your own to learn more.  I don't have much to compare this to as this was my first visit to a food bank, so I had no clue what to expect.  I was extremely impressed on how organized the place was and how many people I saw shopping there.  The food bank allows those that qualify to maximize their budget and get what they need to put food on the table for their families.  It relies on support from our community.  With the economy in the dumps lately, it's nice to know that Desert Mission is there for those that need it.I look forward to volunteering at the Desert Mission Food Bank on November 1st.  If you are reading this and interested in joining (we'll have a small group), PM me for the details or check the Events calendar.
