5	Professional, helpful, and fast. Our deadbolt was broken and he clearly explained what was wrong (the builders installed it incorrectly) and gave us some home safety advice. This guy knows what he's doing. Reasonably priced.
5	Loc Doc came out to my new house and installed 3 new dead bolts for a fair price and with a 1 year warranty. He came the same day I called, arriving when he said he would, carrying a dustpan and broom! I like it when people respect that I try to keep a clean and tidy house.He did the job on a 95 degree day quickly and efficiently, took all the trash with him to recycle and swept up all of the wood dust.I highly recommend Loc Doc!If you are nice -he may even share his favorite fishing spots!
5	I can't recommend The LockDoc enough.  He was extremely prompt, responsive and professional.  The quote he gave over the phone was the exact cost.  If you need any lock smith services, this is your guy!
5	This was an amazing service. I was very stupid and got my car locked while running and me not on the good side of the door. I called this number and spoke with Bill Lehr, the owner, and received a knowledgeable and professional customer service on the phone. The promptness of this service was excellent, though I might have been lucky because I can see this man being in popular demand. From finding out I was locked out to driving away in my opened car, 25 min. Price was more reasonable than I expected for such service, and was delivered professionally and promptly. I've made copies of his card to keep in all the places I'll have access to when I get locked out of something again. I recommend this service to all readers.
