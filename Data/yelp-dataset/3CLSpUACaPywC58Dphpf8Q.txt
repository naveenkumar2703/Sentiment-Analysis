2	Not very hard to find, clean and stocked as all GNC stores are, but the sales girl seemed to have limited knowledge about the products. I feel that a store in this field should have employees who actually know something about the products that they are selling to the public. I am aware that in this day and age, that is something that is not commonplace, but still reduces my rating to only 2 stars!
1	First and last time in this store this afternoon.   The clerk behind the counter complained about the customer who left as I was coming in and then proceeded to lecture me about my desired supplements.  She lost over $150 sale today and many more in the future as this store is on my way home but I will go out of my way for better customer service.
2	They sell some neat stuff but most of it is overpriced. Always a good idea to use their $10 off $20 coupon or wait for their online sales. Tip: If you like protein bars, do try their Quest bars. In store price was $33 per box and online sale came to $21 a box. Go figure!!
1	I wouldnt give them one star if possible. The sales  associate that "helped" us exhibited terrible customer service skills, mispronounced ingredients in one of the products and continuously talked about how she has lost 230 lbs. She was not very helpful and overall uninformed.
