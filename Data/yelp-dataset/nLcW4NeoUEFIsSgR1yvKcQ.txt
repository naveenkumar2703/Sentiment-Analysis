5	Lindsey is Gino & Zina's Groomer, she is EXCELLENT & they Love her!!
5	They have always been great for our animals. Very fast and always accomidating.
5	I heard of this place by word of mouth!I ran into a snag that was my fault and they totally hooked me up-I didn't realize there were two Urban Mutts locations...I called one for appointment and showed at the other...whoops.They were able to just call the other one and say "hey,they're over here, send me a groomer!"If that wasn't awesome enough, they got my 2 doggies done in record time, like less than 3 hours! And she said they were busy that day!On top of all that, the dogs looked and smelled spectacular!I will be taking them here from now on!
5	Love my groomer, Charity, so much, she's been grooming my Silkie Terrior for years, and just moved to this salon! I wouldn't trust someone I didn't know grooming my dog.... She's amazing. Perfect every time, she does cute color work as well!
5	Urban Mutts has changed their name to So Fetch! I took my Saint Bernard and my cocker spaniel here. They did an UNBELIEVEABLE JOB! My Saint Bernard came in with an awful thick coat and she has a summer cut with a lion's tail that's PURPLE! She looks GORGEOUS. So Fetch did above and beyond to what I was expecting. Bridget, my St. Bernard, now has pigtails with beautiful Hawaiian flowers. She has never looked so girly. When I had my cocker spaniel done named Leo, I mentioned that I wanted the long hair shaved off and again, So Fetch did above and beyond and made him look handsome with his new clean cut appearance while keeping his signature ears and legs. To top everything off, Leo and Bridget now have glitter!
