2	Firefly is yet another Food Fight Inc establishment in Madison, this one catering to the Asian fusion set.  Like all Food Fight Inc. places, the decor seems to have been given a larger budget than the menu.  Anything you can find on the menu here (curries, pad thai, etc..), you can find a better version of at any of Madison's other Thai places.  Skip it and head to Sai Bai Thong down the street.
2	Really cool atmosphere.  Mediocre food.
2	The only reason why I can imagine one going here is one member of your party wants sushi, the other wants some kind of Americanized wrap and chips, and yet another wants curry?  You could get all of those things separately and better tasting  elsewhere, but if you need them in once place, I guess you should go to Firefly.
2	Ok, there's something to be said about a restaurant that is two blocks away from your house.  Especially if they DO have yummy and fruity Mai Tais, and Lemongrass Martini that's LOADED with alcohol.  On Friday afternoons, it's rather a cool hangout, and great ambiance. Their food, however, sucks.  It's supposed to be Asian fusion, and while I am still enjoying any "fusion" type place (aka, a hint of ethnic, a ton of Americanization), this is rather mediocre food at best, completely vegetarian unfriendly (which is odd, given the fact that this is Madison).Service is good though, the staff is kind and attentive.But I'd only go there for drinks.  Only because well.. I can walk to and from home.... And get a LOADED martini... YUM!***** UPDATE *******The Firefly Martini, with the ginger infused vodka, IS TO DIE for.******* END OF UPDATE ********
1	THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THE GOOD FOOD FROM 2005????This used to be high atop of my list. But several cooks, and two years later, their food has gone completely downhill. Don't worry though, this place is on University Ave between Madison and Middleton, and since most people eating in Madison won't drive too far, there is no worry of accidentally walking into this place. If you do, turn around and RUN out. Lettuce wraps used to be with butter lettuce, now iceberg?Curried Beef Short Ribs used to be incredible, now the recipe is completed different, and sorry, but not very good.You would be better off fasting than eating here.
1	Firefly is closed and is  now Tex Tubbs Taco...thank god...
