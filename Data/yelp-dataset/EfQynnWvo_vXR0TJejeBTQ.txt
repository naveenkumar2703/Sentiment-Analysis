5	Always great service. Efficient and friendly. Been my bank since 95.
3	In general, all Wells Fargo tellers are friendly and helpful.  The personal bankers here are fine too.  I have only had two problems worth mentioning.  The first was the branch manager, who just seemed too busy and stressed out.  When she tried to help the banker who'd asked her a question to help me, she went halfway... like someone who wants to appear like they're being helpful without actually having the time to be helpful.  Since I rarely have to deal with managers in a bank, I'll hardly hold that against them.  More often than not, I'm just using the drive through ATM.  My second complaint is that a teller accidentally held on to my debit card after a transaction, having taken it behind the counter.  When she called me later to tell me I'd left it, she insinuated it was my fault for being forgetful.  I'll split that blame down the middle.Located on the corner of a busy intersection as they are, it can be difficult to get in the parking lot without disrupting traffic.  I tend to plan my errands strategically so I only have to enter this bank if I'm heading south or west.
1	Very unhelpful and rude. I sat down with Francisco Ramirez to go over details of my account. I didn't have a debit card so he asked for two forms of ID. I handed him two STATE issued IDs and he said that would not work (iv never heard of that) it was an Arizona ID and my state drivers license. I has to go to my car and get my business license. After that he was rushed and very short and rude and my problem wasn't resolved. He just told me to call the number on the back of my card for better luck. Never coming back to this branch again.
