1	I USED to have really long hair.  I wanted 5 inches off, but the woman at Fantastic Sam's decided to cut 12 inches off instead. I hoped beyond hope that my hair would be longer once I got home and it dried - you guessed it, she didn't even blow dry it for me - likely knowing how much she'd screwed it up!  She couldn't get me out of there fast enough!Needless-to-say, my hair didn't get any longer after it dried .....worse yet, when I got to work the next day - everyone kept telling me how it wasn't even near straight in the back.  HORRIBLE experience!!!  Would NEVER recommend them!  You get what you pay for!  I'll never make that mistake again!  If they had negative stars, I'd definitely give them!!
5	I love my hair stylist.... JENNIFER knows my hair and she cuts it perfectly.  Since  I've been to this Fantastic Sams for about 4 years now, I know that my head, appearance, and hair will be well taken care of.  Thank you Jennifer and Fantastic Sams.
