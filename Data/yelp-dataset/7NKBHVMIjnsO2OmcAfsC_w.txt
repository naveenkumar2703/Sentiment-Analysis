5	As good as yogurtland.  Fresh toppings!
5	I LOVE this place! The yogurt is delicious & they have Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory toppings! Need I say more?? Only negative I can think of is that the toppings in the back row are VERY difficult to reach (I noticed I wasn't the only one struggling to reach them) - they should change the cover or something to make it more accessible. But other than that, 2 enthusiastic thumbs up.  I will be visiting this place very frequently this summer.  I would move in if they let me.
2	My boyfriend and I were so excited to hear that there was a yogurt place going in. We were even more thrilled to hear that they stay open until 10 in the summer! We are definite night owls so we were more than ready to appreciate the later hours. Unfortunately we've driven by around 9:15 - 9:30 several times now and every time we do they already have the stools and chairs picked up and the couple times we ignored the signs and went  in anyway we've felt less than welcome. If you want to close at nine then close at nine! Also really frustrated with the lack of water availability. Can't believe they don't offer free cups to quench your thirst. Not worth it. Definitely not somewhere we feel like we can go to detox and chill at the end if the day like we hoped it would be.
4	Love the self serve.   Brownie bites are a great topping
1	Just an FYI...brought my daughter there for ice cream tonight and they are closed . Looks like all equipment is gone. Sad Loss for the area
