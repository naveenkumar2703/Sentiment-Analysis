5	I have had this company doing my insurance for a while. Matt Gregory is my agent and is great. He is always honest and fair with his pricing and will go the extra mile for his clients. I have had great customer service and timely responses from Distinctive Insurance. Insurance companies or brokers usually don't provide the level of customer service that I expect, however i have never had any issues here. Currently all my personal and business insurance is with Distinctive Insurance. My husband is a sceptic and had me quote out prices with various "TV" insurance companies out there. NONE could beat the deals I got through Matt. I really hope it stays that way. Honestly I refer friends to Matt all the time, but this business is noteworthy for you Yelpers. Please consider them when needing anything. I haven't found a better company yet.
5	As a result of my recent divorce, I needed a new auto and renter's insurance policy. Distinctive Insurance was recommended to me by a friend and I couldn't be more pleased. I worked with Leonard Marler. He was helpful and informative. As my ex-husband handled our insurance needs for a number of years, I had tons of questions. Leonard answered all of them and made the transition easier than I ever expected. Distinctive Insurance sent proof of insurance to my old auto insurance company (required in order to drop my old auto insurance policy) and also to the DMV. I would definitely recommend the company.
5	Great agency that offers great service. Very knowledgeable in the area of group health coverage.
