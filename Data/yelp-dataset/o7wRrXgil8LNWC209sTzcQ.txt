5	Sam and his crew helped me transform my overgrown front yard into a beautiful, serene yard that I can be proud to have in front of my house.  The team was very professional and had very reasonable prices.  I am so glad that I found Pacific Landscape because with their vision and creativity we have beautiful curb appeal.  They also offer weekly yard maintenance which I intend to use.
5	Sam and his family crew were awesome to deal with! Excellent work, fast and great prices! Truthfully I was a little worried about the looks and outcome of the fence but Sam took his time and explained everything very well! I love the work and the way it makes our yard look. Also when Sam and his crew were finished, the clean up was excellent. Would have never known they were even there except for our beautiful fence.  Sam finished yesterday and have already had multiple compliments! There is no doubt, that my family and I would recommend Pacific Landscaping!
