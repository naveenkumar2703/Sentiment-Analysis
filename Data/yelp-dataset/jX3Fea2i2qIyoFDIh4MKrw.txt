5	Great help for my nephew
1	It's going to be hit and miss. There are some excellent therapists in the mix of staff there. There are, however, some crooked practices and some very incompetent therapists as well. You will notice many students there. You can take on a lot more clients with all the interns. This enables therapists to have huge caseloads and basically have students be free therapists for them. There are therapists who let students take their entire caseload and supervise minimally or not at all. Watch how they bill you. If you are in a therapy "group", i.e. you and another patient are on exercise bikes or 6 patients with you, your insurance still may be billed as if you were given individual therapy. At least one manager at the facility is aware of this stuff being done. Some students see 30+ patients a day. Hopefully you get a good therapist when you roll the dice and go there.
