5	Always friendly employees.
5	They fix what's broken and live by the golden rule. Love the new easy to use pumps. Now grandma can get her gas if in a pinch.
1	I stopped there for a few things and the attendant working decided it was the right time to get on her cell phone for a personal phone call which I think is very rude.  She didn't even have the common sense to ask me if I needed a bag, which I clearly did as I started putting things in my purse. I had multiple items and it would have been nice if she would have taken some initiative and put them into a bag instead of worrying about talking on her cell phone.
1	Absolutely horrible service. They refused to do propane after their streetlights come on even if it's a bright out tried to tell me he would get fired. Five people waiting for propane and he refused to come outside told me the propane tank turns off because the sun starts to set.
1	Jeez Chevron, how many billions in tax breaks do you need to have your minimart open at 4pm? If we make it a trillion, can I approach the doors without some stoner kid telling me it's closed a scribbled "be back shortly" on the door?Guess you can buy their overpriced gas with a credit card.
