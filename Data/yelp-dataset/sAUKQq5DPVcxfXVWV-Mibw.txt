3	This McDonald's is located in the Midway section of Circus Circus where the circus acts are performed and kids games played.I believe the prices are the same as regular McDonald's locations.  They are not priced higher just because they are located inside a Hotel Casino in Vegas.  So that's a good thing.There are plenty of tables for seating.  Nice spot to getaway from some of the craziness in the casino and/or children's games.
1	HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! They gave me half my order and told me I would be called again when the rest of my order was ready.  Well I was never called so when I went up to the counter to inquire about my order, the employee was very rude and claimed I was called several times which is a lie because I was waiting at the counter. I had to go back to the counter when I realized those idiots forgot to give me my drink cups and I was scolded that I should've asked for my drink cups when I picked up my food. As I was walking away they were loudly talking $ht about me. UNBELIEVABLE!
4	This is probably the best customer service I've gotten at a McDonald's ever in my life. Their cashier Felecia was so nice that it caught me off guard. Of course it's just your regular McD's but with fast & friendly service!
4	Stopped by this McDonald's location to cool off when wandering through Circus Circus. The place is pretty small but does the job. Tables were clean and service was fast. I did not get any attitude while ordering which is always a good thing.
