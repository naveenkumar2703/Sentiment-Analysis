3	the turdoori chicken is good! the place is clean and the staff was friendly! the rice wasnt to my liking but it wasn't bad. Also my bf got the lunch buffet deal which we ot to go and it wasn't bad. For 9.99 he got rice, lamb, chicken, some dessert thing and bread, oh and rice. And a soup. See! Not a bad deal! lol. We got it to go. The place is sort of old school looking with the black and white title and pinkish decor but, like i said very very clean. Oh and the meal i got was also about 9 dollars. Wasn't the cheapest but i had the meal at 2. I'm still full! :)

It's a fun mismatch. Even weirder, there is also Filipino food on the menu! Strange combination, but I like it! I've only ever had the buffet. Some of the items are hit or miss, but the tandoori chicken is yummy and the aloo gobi is also very enjoyable. The owners don't always have the same thing on the buffet, so it's always a nice surprise to see what they're serving for the day. The paneer naan is delicious and I could happily eat only that for the rest of my life.
4	The other Yelp'ers really nailed it... no ambiance with the diner booths, but the food is good, and it's family owned, so you can't beat that.  And the prices are great.  We grabbed a $25 restaurant.com GC for $2, and I ended up paying under $30 including tax and tip for 2 chicken dishes, a shrimp dish, and two orders of nan.  My favorite was the chicken tikka masala... very flavorful.  Wish this place was closer to my house and/or was open later.  But I'll be back.
1	Boo, this place is out of business.
