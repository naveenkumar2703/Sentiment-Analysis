5	Amazingly good Mexican food!  I had the shrimp cocktail and the Asada burrito. The shrimp cocktail was extremely fresh tasting for the being in the desert. The Asada burrito was fantastic. Some of the best marinated steak I've had in a Mexican restaurant.  I'm pretty sure the owner is cooking the food so that's always a plus.  Clean bathrooms and dining area. Yummy food!  Will be back.
5	Cilantro's has been impressive in a few of the dishes I've tried. Theirs tacos of course are delicious.  Has the shrimp cocktail and finished it to the very end not even juice left. Ate the torta and was finger licking goodness!! Had even the caesar salad no piece of lettuce left behind along with the great flavor.  Btw, this wasnt all in one sitting. Each plate has inticed me to keep coming back and keep trying their menu.  They have a little bit of something for everybody. Can't wait to try the next dish. Thank you Cilantros!!
5	Legit Mexican food! Service was spot on (Mario went out of his way) and the food quality was great. Will definitely return to try other items.
5	Very very VERY delicious tacos!!!! Best tacos I've had in ages! I love the fact that the chips ARE MADE!! Not bought at stores. Don't get me started with the salsas! Best salsas ever! Clean bathrooms,clean restaurant , and very nice people! I recommend this restaurant to y'all(: thank you cilantros!
1	Nothing especial about the food here.  Just a regular tasting Mexican restaurant.   Rice and beans taste like Robertos and food has same flavor.
4	Fresh made chips! Good salsa and the Asada Nachos are awesome. Hidden gem for sure. Hopefully will be around for awhile. Came 2months ago and food was just as good both times.
