4	= = = = = =  WEEKDAY BREAKFAST BUFFET!  = = = = = =I stopped in here for the first time this morning to give the breakfast buffet a try.  I found it to be a friendly, clean & comfortable coffee shop type restaurant (ala Denny's), featuring a daily breakfast buffet from 6 AM.  There were about 35 different morning munchies out including various kinds of cold cereal, fruits (mostly canned), & scrambled eggs that you can fancy up with sliced, sauteed mushrooms, onion slices, cheese sauce, salsa, & more.  There was hot cereal too, Potatoes Au Gratin, bacon, pork sausage, pancakes, french toast, & more.  In fact, my favorite items were the biscuits & gravy, the Potatoes O'Brien, & the Corned Beef Hash.Now this is no Verona Chophouse, but it's also $6, not $20!  I thought it was very good for the money.
5	Real good food and service. Lots of regulars.
2	It wasn't terridble, but I'll never return.  The server was rude, the food was OK, but not good.The good:  The onion rings and the place was fairly clean.The bad: Server was rude and the steak sandwich was a lump of meat on a slice of bread cut in half... nothing else.
1	Service was good, food was poor.
4	I visited this restaurant a couple of weeks ago for breakfast on a Monday and was impressed, not by the food (all breakfast buffets are basically the same) but by my waitress named Stephanie.  She was warm and friendly talking to people when she had time and just sharing warmth throughout all her tables.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good.  It's just that Stephanie made it outstanding.Today I brought my wife for the first time to this place for the first time.   I brought her because of my experience with Stephanie.  Our waitress was very polite and efficient.  We enjoyed our bkfst buffet very much.Upon leaving, we decided we'd go back......all because of the personality of one woman....Stephanie, whose name I just learned today.Recap:  Food good.  Ask for Stephanie's table it will kick your dining experience up a notch!
5	During the holidays I purchased pies from JBs.  First of all the Manager was very helpful and personable.  Secondly the pies were out of this world.  I am not a pumpkin pie eater, but their pumpkin pie was delicious.  Their apple pie was like I have never tasted and I have tasted a few including homemade.  You've gotta' try the apple pie it will spoil you to any other pie,

5	Here's another great place for home-cooked meals.  They also have a really comprehensive buffet.  They have specials for the over 55 crowd, for breakfast and more.  On Wednesdays the place is hopping with retired folks playing pinochle and enjoying themselves.  This is one of the few places that I can get liver and onions as an entree so I go about once every two weeks. They also make wonderful sandwiches so don't hesitate to stop by if you're in the area.  The staff is quite good and the price is right.
3	The breakfast buffet was delicious, well stocked, and had a great variety of choices.I enjoyed the chorizo and eggs, and the biscuits and gravy.It's a good buffet, for not a lot of money. I'll be back.
4	I just got into town, it's time for lunch and my friend suggests we go to JB's.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#2EgVWhCOv-7DeELNh0ZvWA   SERVICE: We walked in, are greeted with a smile and were seated quickly.  The servers are all very friendly and when I asked to get a small sample of one of the soups to taste it, they happily said "of course!"FOOD: I look over the menu and everything looks really good, but I decided on the Cuban Melt.   It's roasted pulled pork, sliced ham, Swiss cheese, mustard and pickle chips on grilled marbled rye bread ($8.29). It comes with french fries and a dill pickle spear, but I opted for onion rings. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#t_Pp5iY7t8SiamWBuNvBEgA close up.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#x7NE7o3JicBDwCbVeb3o8QThe roasted pork was tender and had a great flavor and everything else worked in unison to create delicious sandwich!  I opted for onion rings instead of fries.  They tasted pretty good but we're kinda greasy and when I bit into them the breading fell right off.My friend had a bowl of clam chowder and said it was O-K.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#Ecs--5eNPD9QSXdLyo6Q4QOne other note, while I didn't opt for the salad bar, I was impressed by the variety of items available!   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#0B-AG7KYniJehO-k0CdMcwOVERALL: A really delicious lunch at a nice place with very friendly service.
4	Breakfast buffet was yummy for the kids. I ordered the ribeye and eggs. Steak was bettee than average for a breakfast type restaurant. Service was good and very friendly staff. Hot chocolate was delicious a d just what we needed after the rain coming down!
1	Me and my girlfriend wanted to try it out for the first time. Never never ever wanted to return. Turns out we were enjoying the buffet it was good though. So we go back to fill our plates again I come back only to see a big cockroach just chillin on my fork. I raised hell, and for my roachy meal for free.
