3	Ah, Lidl.  Where would I be without your shelves of cut-price groceries, your cheap rip-offs of well-known brands, your large and cheerless aisles and extensive range of discount alcohol.Probably leading a far healthier and more fulfilled life, to be honest.  But anyway, Lidl does keep bringing me back time after time, unable to resist its astounding cheapness.  This branch, in Leith's Newkirgate, is a big one, so has the added bonus if offering a sundry assortment of budget household goods - I found a very good air mattress here once.Anyway, if money's tight you can't beat Lidl as a place to buy groceries, and I do maintain that there are a few things here - their German ryebread for example, or fairtrade bananas, that genuinely offer quality as well as value.
4	This is the nicest place to shop in the most awful New Kirkgate Shopping Centre (- see my review - http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/new-kirkgate-shopping-centre-edinburgh -) It is not large, but it has everything (and more) that is needed for a daily shop. They even have a small 'fresh market' like feel to it now the freshly baked bread counter has been introduced. So good and cheap. What do I usually buy here? Bread, vegetables, milk, salami, liquid soap, red wine, chicken, beef mince and chicken & pasta soup (those ones in a tin for 99p). What I don't buy? Beauty products, Slippers, workbenches, shoes, pans, spirits (I am little snob regarding these and unknown brands of Vodka, Rum,Whisky or Gin tend to irk me..) Especially the special themed week discounts is a great way to get the brands and produce from the continent that you usually don't get here in the UK. - I even bought Siberian Reindeer Steaks for Christmas last year!I salute you Lidl Scotland, for making my shopping needs less of a chore!
