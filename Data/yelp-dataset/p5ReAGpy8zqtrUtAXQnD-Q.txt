3	This is the first time i've ever gone to this place and it's pretty much a hole-in-the-wall. the atmosphere was a little too bar-ee (as my friend said), a little noisy, there were people playing poker that took up about 6 tables. It was friday and they had "all you can" fish and chips. I though that deal was very reasonable, it was $8.95, but it seriously took 15-20 just to bring out my second order or fish, which the second batch only came with two small pieces of cod. The service was SUPER slow, so if anyone goes on fridays for "all you can eat" fish and chips, i suggest ordering your second batch right after you get the first one just to keep the momentum going.
1	Closed bankrupt
1	This place is not bankrupt anymore. They are open for business although I don't know how or why. The food is terrible, and I mean Really terrible. The bar is ok but mostly the typical local bar huggers. I didn't try any mixed drinks so I don't know if they can make a drink or not, but they sure can't cook.
