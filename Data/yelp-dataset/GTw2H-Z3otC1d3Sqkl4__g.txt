4	Quite possibly the most beautiful street in all of Edinburgh, this elegant, curving, twin-layered goddess of a thoroughfare is perfectly placed to catch the light at the best time of the day. Its shops are a jamboree of colour and variety - book shop, pig shop, tweed shop, map shop, juice shop, dress shop, red, blue, pink, green. Up until recently it even featured a Christmas shop, and landed itself a starring role in the film adaptation of Filth.I absolutely love this street, but I must confess to never having bought anything other than comestibles from it. I walk past Walker Slater every time with an aching heart and a longing eye, but I might as well be wishing for a platinum pony.All the same, I often take a slightly longer route down Victoria Street and back up Candlemaker Row instead of straight over George IV Bridge, just for the pleasure of walking down this beautiful street.
