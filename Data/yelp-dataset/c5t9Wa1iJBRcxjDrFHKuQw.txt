5	What a terrific event was thrown downtown here in celebration of the Arizona Centennial!  Of course the high point for me was Michelle Branch's stellar performance Saturday night in front of the Capitol Dome!     :-))(Enjoyed the Gin Blossoms too!)
5	Way to go Phoenix, wish we could do this every year. Parking was a little tough but it was covering such a huge area that it thinned out the parking. It was so huge we didn't even walk the whole thing. We spent plenty of time at the kid zone which had many jumpers that were free, yeah!!  There was a fair like area where you pay for games (over priced) but still a nice option. There was a bungee, slide, spinning rides, & zip line that looked cool. There was also lots of fair like food but with more options. A few stages for music but we didn't go late for headliners, there was the military area that had lots on display, a cowboy are with the OK coral fight going on, Indian area, Hispanic area, art area, well every type of area that you can think of.
5	What an amazing event!  I had a blast and won tons of free stuff! The history tents were amazing. I had so much fun at the Gin Blossom concert. The only bad thing is that there was way too much going on this weekend.
