4	The Swarovski store is very pretty indeed and everything about it is very bling and you'll leave with stars in your eyes. They always have a great selection of classic, timeless pieces as well as more contemporary unusual items too. I've had my eye on a rather oddball collection for a while, it's a little orange fish with really bulbous eyes and it looks pretty similar to my own little goldfish. In addition to jewellery they also have the traditional Swarovski ornaments in shapes of little bears and other animals. The staff in this branch are nice and friendly and everything is immaculate and I'm always scared to point at items in case I get grubby paw marks on the pristine glass cabinets.
