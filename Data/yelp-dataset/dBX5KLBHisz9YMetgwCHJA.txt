2	You can definitely have fun where ever you go when you're with friends, but unless this is the last stop of your night you may want to find other plans for the night. It's one big dance floor with a lot of under-agers and random people. The music is OK, but the whole set up is (for lack of a better word) ghetto. The coat check line take forever and it's not really secured.
2	The extra star is because Josh Ritter put on an amazing show and the venue allows you to get very close to the musicians if you want to, however, some security is needed. When you're paying $20 for a ticket, drunk freshman from the local university who have no interest in the band should not be allowed to heckle, scream in the middle of songs, and smash into the backs of unsuspecting patrons. What could've been an amazing night was almost ruined by a few idiots, but the staff at the Starlight didn't seem to care about this at all.
5	Lee Fields live, November 1st. Excellent performance, sound and venue. I love starlight.
