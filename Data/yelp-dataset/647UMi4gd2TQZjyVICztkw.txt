2	A coffee shop in the basement of a church.  Thank God its the only one in town, because its too quiet, too stuffy and you can't hold a decent conversation here.

Now, when it's summertime, and you're like 9 years old, all you can think of is wanting to be in a pool.  The thing was, these people would only let kids swim in the pool that went to their church, or that agreed to go to church with them to check it out.  Their church was weird, in Utica WI, and was kind of creepy.  These are the same people that handed out religious tracts on Halloween, and went door to door in the neighborhood asking if people kept pornography in their home, because their church was having a drive against porn.My feelings about the Catacombs can be summed up as the same feelings I had about these people; creepy, but tolerable.
