1	$35 just to pack some clothes I bought at the mall. This does not include the $16 to ship. Look for a box and pack it yourself. Use UPS if the box will be large and heavy, otherwise, USPS or FEDEX Ground is way cheaper. Boxes can be found by asking the housekeeper or the maintenance guy. The store you bought the stuff will have boxes too. Take a roll of shipping tape or buy it at the PO or any drug store for $3.99.
1	I've had my mail come here for three years.  I've received many packages and been in every week.  Last year they had me provide a fresh copy of my ID, etc. after having apparently lost it.  Today I forgot my keys and asked them to open my box and get me my packages.  They refused saying they couldn't verify I was the holder.I had them pull the paper file of the ID, etc.  They had lost everything I provided.  I wonder where this personally identifiable information went - twice.  They tried to make their refusal to provide the name of the box holder appear to be about them complying with federal law.  Sillyness.  Come on guys, pull yourselves together.
4	The staff was courteous and helpful.  There is a fee to ship out of the store due to the fact that this particular location is within a hotel on the Las Vegas strip.  Another customer there was upset by this, but hey what do you expect?  You're in Vegas, everything costs something.  I had a good experience at this store and would definitely use them again should the need arise.
1	So they charge a hotel charge of $6 on top of what it take to ship my package off. No thanks. But the counter person was nice in telling you that.
