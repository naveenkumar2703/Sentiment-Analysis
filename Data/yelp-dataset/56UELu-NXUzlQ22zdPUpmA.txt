4	Although it is expensive, Calvin Klein Underwear stocks amazing quality bras and underwear with a good range of sizes and styles. Whether it's something fancy, everyday or sporty you're looking for you will find it here. The staff are really helpful and you are always greeted with a smile which is nice.I have a few really good quality bras from here and even though they're a little bit more expensive than I would usually spend, they have last for ages and they come up good as new after every wash.Look out for sales as they often have fantastic sales on where you can bag yourself a bargain or two!
3	Whether you like Calvin Klein underwear that is up to your own personal choice. As far as this branch goes I was somewhat disappointed. Being on the more upmarket Multrees walk I was hoping to find a few of the more hard-to-find pieces of their range. Alas I just found what you can find in most department stores anywhere. What's the point of having a boutique then? The staff are OK, some are friendlier than others. Prices are like any Calvin Klein store- quite high but as Eleanor pointed out, you can grab a bargain or two at sale time- if you can find your size that is.

The elastic's broken, they're covered in holes, and forever tainted with the unshakeable aroma of a decade's worth of droppings, but they've never done me a bad turn yet.Perhaps I'm just a bit too comfortable being a disgusting human being, but I really don't see me ever spending a great deal of cash on knacks, when there are far more rewarding things in life to blow the wages on. That said, it's good for the city to have such designer shops, and if you fancy treating your testicles to a bit of luxury, then here's your place.
