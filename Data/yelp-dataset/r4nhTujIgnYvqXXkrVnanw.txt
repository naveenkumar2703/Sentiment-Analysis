5	When I first moved to Tempe and noticed this place, I was kind of blown away by the concept of an independently-owned, local framing shop. I brought in a print to be re-framed (had to get rid of the icky pink frame... an unfortunate side effect of having an all-pink bedroom in middle school) and they spent a lot of time helping me pick a beautiful new frame. It was expensive, but worth it. They also un-framed (if that's the right term) some really big vintage family photos for me and explained that it was a good thing I'd chosen to do that, as they'd been improperly framed and would have eventually been ruined. Eek. When I came to pick up the photos, I was expecting them to just hand over a stack, but they had carefully wrapped them separately with cardboard and butcher paper. Cool.I'm definitely going back here when I want some really high-quality framing done. I'm kind of kicking myself for having stuff framed at Aaron Bros. before, and spending so much money there, when I could have gotten -way- better advice and personalized attention at this place.
5	He helped me pick out a perfect frame for my very perfect Elvis mirror. Friendly, helpful service, and made arrangements for me to pick it up after-hours. (Call ahead for hours... they're not open every day). I am more than pleased with the care he took to make my rare, vintage piece of Elvis happiness as beautiful as it deserves to be.
