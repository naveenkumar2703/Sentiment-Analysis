5	Sands Carstar is actually Sands Chevrolet but they service everything.  I recently had some body work done to my Toyota Rav4 by Sands, at the recommendation of my insurance company.  I could not find any reviews on Sands Carstar and was a bit reluctant but I couldn't find any other body shop with consistent positive reviews, so I gave them a chance.  Everyone was professional, the lot was secure and the repairs performed were done right.  I am a bit picky when it comes to vehicle repairs and I was pleased.  The body lines matched up, the paint matched perfectly and everything was done right.  I was also concerned with the use of aftermarket parts and my estimator assured me they would use OEM parts and the insurance company would not let them use anything else.  We have had the car back for about a month and so far I have not noticed any problems.
5	We took our Chevy Suburban and Acura TL into the Surprise location and Matt took care of everything.  We had body work done on both cars -- which were both completed with in a two day time period.  It was convenient to go to my local Sands for estimates and drop off/pick up.  Will use again if needed.
5	Great People! Great Service! :oD
