5	We love this place. We have been through the drive-thu so many times.  We always get the veggie burro, fries, and the taco combo. The burro is giant; filled with beans, rice, guacamole, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions.  They have crinkle fries.We love Erikbertos.
4	This place is way better then Filibertos because you don't wind up with the horrible bathroom problems. They are also cheaper, carne asada fries here are like $5 as opposed to $7 for the same amount.  They also have guacamole chips which I have not been able to find anywhere else and I have a serious addiction to them. There would be a picture but I eat them way too fast for that to happen!  The ground beef tacos are also super yummy!
1	Got the order wrong, one item and tried to over charge me!  No one in the drive thru at all. Went to filibertoes down the street at Signal Butte and 6 cars in line!  Hope the OWNER can get things together. Disappointing to say the least.
