4	This place is a bit too modern and clean to be considered an authentic St Louis style BBQ establishment, however, the food is a nice surprise to stumble across way out here in the desert.  The Brisket is amazing, although, some may say it's just a tad over priced for BBQ, but worth it in my opinion.  There's another location in Mesa on Alma School just south of the 60.
5	This is some of the best BBQ I've ever had. Pulled pork is incredible. Big portions of food at great prices. Fast service. A great place to hang out and have some drinks as well.
4	I ate here once w hubby after we wandered around Whole Foods next door...I was starting to get cranky and nasty. Hubby knew it was time for me to be fed.I was hungry and completely demolished my plate. I don't even remember what I ordered. It was rumored to be brisket, but I was so hungry I didn't check twice. I left with a happy belly. Food tasted good, but the overall impression of the place was, "It's not that big, it's clean enough and the portions were pretty big."I became a fan, but hubby said his food wasn't so good and had no desire to come back and give them a second chance. Boo. :( Pity because we live so close to them.
