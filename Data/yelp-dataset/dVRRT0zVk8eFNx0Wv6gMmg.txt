1	The worst experience I have ever had at a Chili's. Hands down the most unprofessional crew and management I have seen. Will not be returning. Waitress was rude and insincere the entire time. When addressed with the manager he was unable to fix the problem and even double charged us for a portion of the meal! The margarita I had from them was excellent as usual.
2	I've been to many locations and this one was okay. The food didn't seem to be as good and the staff seemed to be unsure of what they were supposed to do. It was bizarre how different the atmosphere was from other Chilis .
3	Ok, so far... no coronitas for margaritas, no Miller Light on draft? Service was good, food good.
4	Came here a couple nights ago and we had a pleasant experience. No wait, was seated quickly and server was nice. Food was on point and we even had dessert, try the blondie! We even got to color a chili and they said they would put it up on the wall, haha. Taking away one star because we had to ask twice for a to-go box. But other than that it was a good trip to Chili's. :)
4	After not eating at a Chili's for over ten years I decided to give them another try.   Really glad I did.   I have come back at least four times in two months.   Everything I have tried has been surprisingly great.    Items I have ordered on my previous visits include, guacamole and salsa, chicken strips, both original and crispy, fajitas, classic sirloin, ribs, corn, mashed potatoes, spinach and artichoke dip, "big mouth bites."   Also, have had their house margaritas and specialty margaritas and they are awesome.   Service has been polite and efficient.  Servers have knowledge of the menu items.  If you sign up for their e-mail club you are periodically sent promotional coupons.    Give them a try.   You will be pleasantly surprised.
