2	Completely average pub.Sitting in here made me a little bewildered about the British people. Why do we like all pubs to look the same? Why do we like all our supermarkets to be the same? Why does everyone in this pub dress the same.  Before I could order anything, I did the quickest 180 of my life and left. Not for me, but it seems to be popular with everyone else!
3	Situated literally 50 metres from Tynecastle stadium, it's an obvious hotspot with the Hearts supporters and all around the pub you will find Hearts memorabilia as well as signed Scottish football shirts and the like.The decor of the pub is pretty old, but in all honesty this is probably what gives the pub so much characterI came here just before a Hearts game versus Rangers and it was very packed, but the bar staff were very fast in taking orders. The vast majority who venture into the Tynecastle Arms are Hearts supporters with away fans opting to frequent other venues.I would come back here, but only if I were going to see Hearts play.
3	Shame on me for not spending enough time in this pub. It's just along the road from me but I rarely get in there.If you're looking for a quiet pub to while away a weekday evening this could be for you. Quite how quiet it is when Hearts play at home next door is another matter... I have yet to experience this.
