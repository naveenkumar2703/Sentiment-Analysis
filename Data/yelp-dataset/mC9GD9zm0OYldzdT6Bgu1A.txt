5	So happy to find out about this mobile auto detailing through a friend.  We are preparing to sale a vehicle and wanted our car fully detailed.  The owner was very easy to work with and explained in detail the costs and services available.  He came to our home at the time scheduled and worked really hard since our car needed some major work.  We had "The works" done which one of the things included carpets shampooed and we even had the car hand waxed.  I would personally refer this company to friends.  The work he did was amazing. Now, lets pray we don't get rain.
5	I recently paid off my car and wanted to give it a full detail to celebrate! JC was on time and spent hours detailing every little spot in and on my car. The carpets look brand new, the inside is spotless, and the outside is amazing. It truly looks like a new car. I was very impressed by the time he spent on the car. You can tell he has a lot of pride in his work and wont stop until its perfect. I will definitely recommend him to anyone who is looking for a mobile car wash and my fiance and I will continue to use him in the future.
1	Not sure what to rate this.  I called the number listed, twice.. Both times I got a woman who claims there is no one there who details cars...WTF???  Sound a little too fly by night for me.  If someone contacts me and explains what happened I'd be glad to remove my rating. But until then, I guess they are out of business.
