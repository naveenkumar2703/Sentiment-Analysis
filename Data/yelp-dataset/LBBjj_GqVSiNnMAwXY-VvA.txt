2	drive thru for scrips is not worth it.  go inside and you will still wait forever..
1	It is unbelievable how slow this pharmacy has become. New techs plus a ton of new patients equals REALLY long lines and wait times.
1	This place is horribly slow. They promised 45 minutes and it was an hour and a half. Would not return or use again.
1	I came in to purchase some beauty products and the Clark was a jerk!! I cancels my whole order . Horrible customer service!
1	Extremely terce and impolite clerk at the pharmacy counter.We will not be returning to this location-- a bit of positive customer service goes a long way!
5	Great customer service at both the pharmacy and the store. I fill all my scripts here and they always have great sales. Great for couponing!
1	If I could give no stars I would!! The customer service in the pharmacy here is horrible. The give time estimates them tell you to come back two hours later when you show up at the time they originally quoted you! The staff is rude and not empathetic towards their fellow human beings. Not to mention their new policy not allowing me to use a discount card because I don't have insurance (even though I have been using it for months! My rx is normally $280 and the discount card brings it down to $130... I fill my rx every month... It's very expensive even with the discount card.. But still doable). Oh, and they won't be accommodating and take a family member credit card information over the phone who is out of state.. Even if the person goes to another cvs!
