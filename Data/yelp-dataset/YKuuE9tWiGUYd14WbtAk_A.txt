4	Quick service, good selection of ice cream, amazing selection of add ins. Not many choices for low fat ice creams.
4	Service is a little slow, however the ice cream is awesome!!Maybe they need some more help in the afternoon?Today only one person doing the ice cream and register.
3	The new oreo filling ice cream is fantastic. TThe prices are a little hight. They are adding new selections all the time. I saw a sign this last visit that they now have shaved ice. The service is pretty slow sometimes but everyone is usually friendly and they keep the tables clean.
5	I accidentally went on a school fundraiser night the line was long but the staff was working quickly. They were all friendly and helpful, the ice cream was rich and delicious and to top it off I had a buy one get one free coupon from my dentist. Without the coupon I would say the pricing is on the higher end.
4	I have absolutely no idea what that guy is talking about and given his other postings from the same day its clearly not genuine. This place is amazing. The staff is incredibly friendly ask for Grace, it's the best looking store I've ever been in, and the ice cream is amazing. Spend one night there and see for yourself.
