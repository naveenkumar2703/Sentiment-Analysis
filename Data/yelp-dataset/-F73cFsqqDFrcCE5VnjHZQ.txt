5	Love Hello Kitty? Well you'll love this store that has a variety  HK merchandise and other Sanrio characters too. Tokyo World is part of the Tokyo Discount chain. This  new store is smaller but is stocked with the more popular Japanese imports like Green Tea Kit Kats!   That made me happy!   The location is on the lower level of the Galleria Mall near JCPenney.
5	Tokyo world is absolutely amazing and awesome!  Nice employees, adorable and cute items!  If you're into anime and hello kitty,  you should definitely go here. Definitely will be going here for every holidays for presents! Cheap prices too. Tokyo discount/ world. Love this place to death. I'm just soooo excited there's one in a mall now. 5 stars to say the LEAST!
5	Finally opened another stationary store! I hate how Morning Glory closed, but this store was great! I always go to the Tokyo Discount in California (but a 4 hour drive, just no). I only bought a pencil here, but I'll definitely be back for more!
3	I'm glad they have an anime store here since I love anime. Sadly it's mostly hello kitty and not anime. They have some pretty cute things and I love looking around. I gave it 3 stars because it's SO expensive. I bought a small cup for 15 dollars. Probably sold somewhere else for like 6 but I loved it. They have some Japanese snacks and other things. I try never to buy these expansive things but I always love looking.
3	Cute lil hk store in the mall. I heard about this store theu yelp and thought i'd check it out. Tiny store, filled with the tokyo discount goods. Its ok for the most part, but I'd rather go to their sister stores around town (they have a bigger selection).
5	Tiny but this is a good store for times when you're not sure what to get someone for a gift. You'll end up deciding within time. I like the air fresheners & the rilakuma selection. Love this store, always stocked up with new items. love it.
