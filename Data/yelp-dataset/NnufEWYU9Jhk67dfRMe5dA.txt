5	Wonderful service - my fiance and I both had a full treatment and it was excellent. Thanks Lmarie!
1	I had a gift certificate my husband bough for three body wraps.  She cancelled the first three appts because her father died.  Understandable.  A month later I called to find out if I could schedule the appts.  After many telephone tags I finally got a hold of her.  The website states her hours as T-Sa 9-6.  She told me the appts needed to be every other day so I tried to schedule M, W, F.  She indicated that she teaches a class on T, W, Thurs until 3 so the soonest she could do would be 4.  I told her the certificate and website said her hours were 9-6.  She said, "Things have changed and I'm not calling in my othe girl just for you.  You're not even paying for it so I'm not going to pay her."  Nice way to treat a new customer!  AND it says gratuity is mandatory (breaks NV law) on the certificate anyway.  I'm going to work on getting a refund for the certificate somehow.  Avoid this woman and her so-called "business" at all costs.  Not professional and just not a nice person.  I understand her father died 6 weeks ago but if you are going through emotional problems don't take it out on your customers.
4	Yes, it was a bit difficult getting an appointment, but she was moving and had been gearing up to participate in the Mrs. Nevada pageant. When I finally did get in for my Wow! facial, she was so lovely and spirited I of course forgave the delay. The facial was nice but $85.?
5	Went to L Marie for the first time today.  From the moment I walked in she made me feel special.  Had the Infrared Body Wrap and a Microdermabrasion Facial.  L Marie explained everything before and during the treatments and even provided a lovely fruit and cheese plate in between services.  Want to feel truly pampered?  If yes, go see L Marie. I will definitely be going back.
