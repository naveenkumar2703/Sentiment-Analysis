5	'Tis the season for Santa's elves, reindeer, holiday cheer and Christmas decorations galore, but during this time of year, I especially like to take a step back and remember what Christmas is really all about. I've been going to Our Lady of Joy off and on since I was a teenager. It was the closest church to our place when we visited the desert. Now that I'm a big kid and live here permanently, I typically stick to a church closer to my home since Our Lady of Joy is a pretty long drive for me. But here and there, I'll meet my sister for mass and we'll head up "north." This is a simple church without many frills, but it's got a solid foundation, a great priest (Father Patrick who used to be at St. Thomas) and excellent mass times. The 5:00 PM mass time is perfect for me on days that I don't get up and going in time for 11:00 AM Mass (I know it's not that early, but sometimes I hit snooze 1-20 times on a weekend!) There's not much more I can say about this church other than that it's the perfect one to visit for Sunday Mass if you are in the area, you're Catholic and you're looking for a friendly and welcoming parish.
5	This is by far my favorite church in the area. After having tested several local ones, this one was deemed a favorite byte boyfriend and I even though it is a bit of a drive for us. Physically beautiful inside and out, nestled in beautiful and quiet Carefree, with lovely traditional mass and practices. This church doesn't stray from the mass agenda of the Catholic Church, you can expect traditional action here with the occasional opening joke from the new priest.
