3	I'm not quite sure how to classify this Boots store, because its stock is a little bit unusual. Unlike the mega a few more minutes down Princes Street, you'll hardly find a wide range of cosmetics and perfumes. To be honest, this one reminds me of a school shop, selling all sorts of snacks and pretty good meal deals. Ofcourse you can get the most basic toiletries here, and if there's nothing special you're after I'd actually recommend coming to this store to avoid the shopping mob at the other store.
