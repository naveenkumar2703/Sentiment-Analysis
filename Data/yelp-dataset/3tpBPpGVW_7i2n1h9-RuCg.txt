5	Went to this location to get something for a water filtration system. We were greeted and helped right as we walked in, got the items we needed and were in and out in under 5 minutes! I don't think I've got out of a bigger box chain that fast.
4	This is a smaller store, but the staff was quick to ask if I needed help, and then took me right to what I was looking for.  Not as much variety as the big box home improvement stores, but they have stuff the big boxes don't (like the item I was looking for).And although the store is small, if you spot an item online you can have it shipped to the store for free and just pick it up there.
3	Nice staff, very helpful but not always very knowledgeable - even about their own inventory.Prices on most items are 20-30% higher than Home Depot or Lowes.
