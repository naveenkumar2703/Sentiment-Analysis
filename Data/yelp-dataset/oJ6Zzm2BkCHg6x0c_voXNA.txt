4	Located in the Scottsdale Quarter across from the Drybar, I checked out Carole's Couture based off the beautiful clothes I saw in the window. Entering, I was warmly greeted by Terry, who made my shopping experience so great. Offering pieces from Trina Turk, Michael Stars, Rich & Skinny, and Elizabeth & James, it's hard to walk out of this store empty handed; but if you do, I guarantee you'll have lusted over at least one item.Lucky for me, they had 2 sale racks packed with great pieces up to 60% off. I found a beautiful dress that I couldn't resist; especially for the price! This is a boutique I will definitely return to. I usually avoid being the only person in a store because: A) I feel added pressure to buy something & B) I loathe awkward small talk. Neither of those occur ed at Carole's Couture. Being new to the area, I need all the help I can get; Terry helped me with AZ fashion as well as gave me a few spots to check out in the area!Check out this shop - especially if it says 'sale' in the window!
5	I would just like to begin by saying that this is the place to go if you want one on one service that is based on your own personal style. Carole, the owner, is both passionate about what she does and truly wants to help the costumer feel confident in the clothes you purchase. Although these clothes are on the more expensive side they are clothes that you will have for years to come. Carole specializes in all sizes, from 0 to 12 she has it all. I have found dozens of clothes here ranging from everyday items to dresses worn to black tie events.
1	BEWARE!!!!  Made a purchase and when I got home I found out that the merchandise was defective. When I tried to return it, the owner, tried to keep the merchandise and my money. The owner would not return my calls. When I finally got her on the phone to discuss the matter, she hung up on me. I was forced to dispute the charge with my credit card company. I also contacted the better business bureau.
