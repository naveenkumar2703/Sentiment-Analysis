5	I love Bren! He is so knowledgable about what my issues are and how to fix the root of the problem.  Relaxing and calming atmosphere.  I felt better right away.  I recommend everyone to see him!!!
5	Unwound is the perfect place for a massage.  Why?  Because it is both therapeutic and spa-like.  Bren is expert at massage therapy, explaining what he is doing while he's working on a particular area.  He uses aromatherapy, and the heated table is absolute heaven!  I have sore shoulders and neck issues and see Bren almost once a month.  He is an essential part of my self-care and health regimen.  Another perk: if you hold Unity Health insurance, he will give a discount to you!  He is a caring, professional, and respectful person.  After being to many body-workers, spas, and other massage therapists, I've finally found Bren and will give him my repeat business.
