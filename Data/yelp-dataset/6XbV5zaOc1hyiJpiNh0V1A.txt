5	By far the best home building experience we have had yet, having had 3 houses built previously.  Everyone we interfaced with at Richmond was friendly and helpful, from sales, to the design center, and the building supervisor.  Any issues were cleared up immediately and without question.  They hit every milestone schedule on time, and the various walk throughs went smoothly.House building can be a stressful event, but these guys make it a pleasure!
5	We moved into our new Richmond American home a month ago and we love it! Everything went so smoothly- from sales, to design, to walk-throughs!!Everyone was just a pleasure to work with! This is our dream home, but if we ever build again, I will definitely be on the lookout for another Richmond American neighborhood!!
1	My husband and I built a house with Richmond and were very disappointed with the craftsmanship. We had numerous issues with the house during construction that were just patched up and never actually fixed. Since we moved in we have been ignored by the staff when bringing up issues or just asking questions. They are supposed to repair problems for the first year and we have only lived here 3 months. We live next door  to the model homes in our community and when we went into the office to ask if they could please trim the trees that were growing over into our yard they seemed "put out" when I came home from work the next day the tree in the backyard was trimmed but they left all the branches in my yard, complete disrespect an very unprofessional. I will never Do business with them again I also do not recommend using their title agency our loan officer told us that she didn't have time to answer our questions about the loan...ummm..isn't that your job? She was also incredibly rude every time we spoke
