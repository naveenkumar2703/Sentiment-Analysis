5	I was at a wedding here and it was very nice.
1	The complimentary airport shuttle service that I booked more than 24 hours in advance per their request was never sent to pick me up.Our room was never cleaned - even though we were gone 8am until midnight.One of the staff members verbally abused my friend throughout the night. A long, odd and uncomfortable story.The manager never bothered to return the message I left her highlighting these issues.Yikes!
1	Pool was dirty and disgusting. Too bad since the rest seemed nice
