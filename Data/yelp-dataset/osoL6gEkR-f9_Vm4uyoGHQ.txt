5	Dr. Zeluff is a great doctor. Very professional. Good bedside manner and very understanding. He explains everything.
5	Ive been seeing Dr. Z for years and hes great. I love that he only does GYN this means you always get to see your doctor. I've been to many GYN that do OB as well its very frustrating to have your MD be unavailable for various amounts of times b/c of deliveries. You never have that with Dr. Z. Additionally his bedside manner isTOPS. As long as he's practicing, i'll be there!
1	I've been a patient for years till today, I went in for my yearly checkup and the staff announced loudly to a filled waiting room if the dr sees me he won't get paid. I have a steady job with a large  govt agency, I have insurance and I pay my bills. What insurance won't cover my other drs just bill me for, it's never more than $20.   I think you even sign something that you are responsible, and I've never refused to pay.First she  said I had an HMO,then story changed that I can see only Sierra providers( wrong and wrong,I have a PPO with out of network benefits I can see any provider and they will get paid).   Besides I told them what kind of insurance I had at the time of the appt. but they said they forgot to check that it was covered.  I even called my provider there in the hallway and they said I was covered.During part of this the dr himself was out in the office area, he  looked uncomfortably  at the ground when he walked past and wouldn't  meet my eyes. If  we are going to scream for money what about my lost income for the 1.5 hours I took off to go out there.  I think I will send him a bill for my time.My confidence is shaken, if they can be wrong about my insurance what if there are mistakes about something serious like medical test results.
5	So knowledgable and friendly. Made me feel very comfortable and his staff is very nice and helpful as well. Definitely recommend.
