4	Was there yesterday for a group event. Great, fast and friendly service. Food was standard Kelsey's fare: delicious but not for the weight- or health-conscious. Go for a treat, or for fun. Ultimately, a great place for a group gathering.
1	This was the absolute worst restaurant experience I've ever had. If that statement doesn't explain it I don't know what else will. I can honestly say I ordered a Quesedilla for dinner and it wasn't all that bad however it took an extremely long time to arrive at the table. My dining partner's meal however was another story... He ordered a seafood lingunie and that was a big mistake. As the waiter was approaching our table we knew he was coming as we could smell the food before we even saw her. When his pasta arrived he tried to eat it but I couldn't even bare to eat mine because the smell was so terrible. We are typically very friendly and a little shy so it was hard for us to bring ourselves to let the waiter know how bad his food was but we did. He was very friendly and informed us he would go get his manager and when they returned to the table she began grilling us. We are in our early 20's and I'm not sure if that's what encouraged her to address us in such an inappropriate manner but she did, she accused us of being unfamilier with seafood and the smell that it omits. When we told her we ate seafood regularly she implied that was a lie. They offered to replace the exact dish but it was obvious that the crab meat was canned, rubbery and likely old so he opted to try some basic chicken wings instead. She grunted and mumbled under her breath as she walked away from our table. All in all the waiter was very nice about  and when the wings arrived they weren't bad but I would still never return.
