3	I hate to give this place only 3 stars, because the atmosphere is comfortable and cozy and the staff will remember you from visit to visit, but the quality of the drinks varies too much for my liking. There is wi-fi, tables inside and out and, even computers available for customer use. This place is never too busy and service is fast.BUT.......My first time in gave me 5 star service and 2 star bubble tea (which btw comes in a smoothie form, different from traditional bubble tea). I prefer to frequent local establishments, so I gave it another go the following week. I had a wonderful espresso in a serene environment , and ended up studying peacefully for about 3 hours. The homey, comfortable couch called me back this past weekend for another study sessions, but I ended up disappointed with an Americano that was too watered down. I think the quality of the drink is dependent on the server, which is sad because this place is sooooo close to me. Give it a try, but be sure to let me know how your drink was, please! May the coffee God's be watching over you on your visit, amen.
