4	I've been going to this Great Clips location since I was in high school--dang that's a long time! I get great service, and you can't beat the price for the hair cut. After going there all these years, I can't even imagine paying big bucks at a salon for a haircut when I can spend less than $20 on a perfectly good haircut at Great Clips. The stylists who work there are very nice and do a great job of listening and delivering the exact cut you want. Honestly, save your money on buying clothes and fun stuff, not on an overpriced salon haircut.
4	Why pay more for a satisfactory job?? This place gets the job done and for a reasonable price.
3	I have to admit that I HATE haircuts. I can't explain why. Maybe it's the awkward exchange of conversation involved where you're expected to reveal details of what you're doing this weekend or other sordid tidbits. I usually remain mum. You always get a different person cutting your hair. Ya I know you can request your stylist and get in line to get your haircut. But I just want to get in and get done with out paying a fortune for a haircut.They do an okay job but everybody has a different style of cutting hair and sometimes I get a little anxious as I'm watching midway through the project. For the most part the final product comes out okay. I give them 3 stars but it's really 2 1/2 stars in my book. Luckily I still visit Chicago enough during the year to get a haircut from my Chicago Barber. I can't wait for this weekend.
