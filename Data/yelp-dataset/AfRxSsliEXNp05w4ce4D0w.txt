5	This is my favorite Starbucks that I stop at on my way to work. The staff moves pretty fast and they know my drink and have it ready by the time I get to the front of the line. They always have a smile on their face. Thomas is always friendly and helpful. Two thumbs way up for this place!
4	This location is in the safeway.  It's a nice location with a lot of seating, which is rare for a safeway starbucks.  The location is very busy, especially in the mornings.  If you're in a rush, it might take awhile to get your coffee.  The staff is very nice.  It's close to the freeway and located on 48th and Elliot.
3	I haven't been to this location in a couple of months. But, I didn't get the kind of Superior Starbucks Service that I'm accustomed to. The young lady seemed like I was disrupting her day by being there to order coffee. She didn't smile, greet me or even ask my name to put on my coffee cup as they normally would do although she didn't need to because it's on my Gold Starbucks card...hint hint I buy a lot of Starbucks Coffee. Despite all of that everyone else was great and so was my coffee!
3	This review is mainly geared for the food menu. Service? Always great! Coffee, tea? Always great! I usually order the croissant. Always Great! Warm and crispy, finally a croissant that tastes as good as it looks. This morning I opted for bacon and gouda. Cant say I was that impressed. In fact, I didn't like it. Very bland. Not enough bacon. Not seasoned. Bread was ok but egg tasted fake. No flavor. Ill have to try something else and update.
