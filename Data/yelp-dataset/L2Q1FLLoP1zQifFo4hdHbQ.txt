2	Grade: DNice place. Nasty, overpriced food. Dopey but hot servers.
3	The view is excellent and the place overall has improved greatly since it changed owners several months ago. The food is actually pretty good now. The service, which used to be very slow and blah, has also gotten better under new management.
4	went here on my way home from a Badger game. not a bad spot at all. was pretty quiet when we arrived, probably due to the fact we showed up after lunch and before the dinner crowd. clean place, plenty of TV's to watch whatever sport you're interested in and a great view of the 18th hole i ordered the Roost Burger and wasn't disappointed. a burger with an over easy egg and bacon on top? sign me up. Very messy but worth it. i managed to eat it without getting it all over myself or all over the bar. for the win. the fries that came with it were great as well. overall definitely a good spot to have a nice lunch or dinner. hopefully i'll be back to check out the huge deck overlooking the golf course and some houses in a nice neighborhood. oh, and also.  there was only the bartender and one server when we arrived. the server didn't seem dopey and as far as being hot. well, he wasn't my type.
