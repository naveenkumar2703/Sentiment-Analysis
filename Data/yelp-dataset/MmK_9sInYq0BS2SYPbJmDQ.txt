1	This review is about the staff at this practice. Everyone at the front desk does just about everything they can to prove their incompetence. The front desk folks - billing and scheduling - lack training and apparently, adequate supervision.  Complaints range from unkempt appearance and marginal hygiene to unprofessional incompetence dealing with forms, scheduling and patients.   The two physicians I dealt with were fine, but the front line is abysmal - no customer service whatsoever and incompetence and attitude rule. You're risking paperwork foul ups, miscommunications, and general slacking with the staff. The physicians at this practice might consider investing some time and attention into training their front line. Should a physician at this practice happen upon this review, please take note and provide some training and supervision to your front office.
5	I have been going to this practice for several years. I have always found the staff very efficient and organized. The waiting room is very pretty and they offer self serve hot beverages while you wait.My doctor is Dr. Feng and I have found him to be very knowledgable and helpful. When I have needed additional tests done outside the office, he has always asked the outside staff to expedite the results to him and they do.
5	Dr Eric Zeidman and his MA Cammie are tops.  The front desk, especially John are fine...sometimes a bit rushed when all docs are in house.  Parking is abysmal.
2	Unfortunately I have to agree with the previous reviewer.  The Doctor was great but dealing with the front desk staff is so difficult I left and went to another practice.  They give phone messages, return phone calls, spell your name right on documents so your prescriptions aren't right... 3 strikes and you're out!  Bummer.
