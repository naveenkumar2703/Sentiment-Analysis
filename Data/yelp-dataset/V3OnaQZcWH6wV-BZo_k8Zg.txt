4	Always love this place, I like going in and checking out their purses, clutches, belts, and even their jewelry.  I know they have stores at most malls but I don't always make a effort to go in.  I know I can always find a store at most airports, and to help time pass, it's fun to check out the goodies.Today, I was surprised to find a fillet barrette for the hair, silver of course and reasonably priced.  A few years back, I obtained one of their charm bracelets with proceeds going to breast cancer support.  It's quality is impeccable, as is this barrette.  I know it will last a long time.  The staff were courteous and took the time to carefully wrap my purchase.  Nice little store.
4	Love this Brighton! Well, not sure how many are in the LAS Airport - but I am a fan of the store in Terminal D. I always seem to find myself stopping off in here before my flight departs. Time to give my shoulder a break from my jam packed DVF carry on - sit her down on the floor and browse around. Really, I think it's better than wasting your time and calorie intake snacking around the airport on a bunch of crap. You might as well go hit up some retail shops and through our economy a bone. This is a great little place to do it. The prices are reasonable and the quality of the product is high. They also have a warranty on all pieces. I like their bracelets, necklaces and earrings. The handbag collection, in my opinion is a little "old" not my style but the sterling silver is really cute. I like to mix and match pieces from here all the time. Nice stuff for yourself or as gifts.
