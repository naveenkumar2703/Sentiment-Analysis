4	Lynsey is right - internet cafes are few and far between these days. Although they are a bit outmoded by phone apps, wifi and dinky little laptops, some of us do not own such portables and thus find we are often cut short.Being the email fiend that I am, I find this place particularly resourceful if I'm wanting a wee sit down and a Hotmail session for half an hour. It's pretty inexpensive and a wee cheeky cup of tea doesn't break the bank. I am yet to try their smoothies but might give em a go now that Lynsey has talked 'em up. Sometimes caffeine is not in fact the answer, and their choice is useful if you need to rehydrate yourself with something colder.As Lynsey has also outlined this place is small, but if you stop by and avoid the peak times it's usually easy enough to get a PC.This place has been great for me on the countless recent visits to Edinburgh. As much as I love sitting in here and checking what my travelling friends are up to whilst sipping on a brew, it's just as handy for backpackers who are flying by to touch internet base before jetting off to another city.It's a shame that internet cafes have become endangered since they are still necessary, but it's a comfort Coffee Home Internet is still representing!
3	There isnt enough need for internet cafe's nowadays, meaning that the few that remain have to be bloody impressive to get thier customers in.Coffee Home Internet is one of those places that somehow manages to survive by selling cheap tea and coffee, a few snacks and cakes to those who want a sit down and a quick session on a compuiter to either kill some time or to get some serious social networking done. I have a laptop, so find no need for such places, but I can still see the appeal of them - so I applaud Coffee Home Internet for the work it is doing!
