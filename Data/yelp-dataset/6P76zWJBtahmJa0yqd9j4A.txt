4	I love this place because it opens at 7am and near my office.  I start work early and sometimes need a great breakfast burrito.  I ordered a sausage egg and cheese burrito with potatoes, I do wish the tortillas were homemade but the burro was very delish.  Sam will make it any way you like, but this place also has sandwiches and it's brand new so they still have that new smell, its very clean and just a little deli in my area.  I also had the BBQ pulled pork special they had the other day for lunch.  It looks like they specialize in pick-ups and deliveries since the area is packed with nearby businesses.   Service is also very friendly.
5	One of the better deli's around!  Food is fresh, employees are very nice (even when busy), and best of all, the food is great!  I highly recommend this place to everyone in the area for lunch!  WAY better than fast food!!!
4	Very good prices with quality ingredients.
