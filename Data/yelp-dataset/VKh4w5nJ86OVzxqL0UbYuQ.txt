5	Best bank I have ever been into. EVERYONE who works there is ALWAYS so nice. Free coffee. Beautiful building. Plenty of parking. Great rates. This is my favorite bank of all time. I keep reminding myself to switch my other accounts to this bank as well. I feel like the other banks keep nickel & diming me. But, not Midfirst. The staff here has been there for a while and know what they are doing, so they don't sign me up for accounts where I will run into random fees. I love this place.
5	5 star service.  Stay away from the Wall Street mega banks and put your money into a community bank like MidFirst.
5	Best private bank in the state of Arizona.  I used to work across the street from the bank, and I was recently in the area and decided to check this branch out as I believe that this was the 1st MidFirst Bank in Arizona.  I enjoyed their fast and friendly staffs.  In and out of the bank in less than 5 minutes.  They also offer nationwide free ATM service, it's a must if you travel a lot like me.  And they are the home bank for Arizona State University Sun Devils!
5	I can't say enough about this bank and this branch.  No ATM fees ever.  Extended Saturday hours and open on SUNDAY!   Everyone knows your name.  David - one of the personal bankers is amazing. Helpful, personable and even made opening an account for my kids an educational and fun experience.  Truly a community bank with a personal focus.
5	The people at MidFirst really take care of you and make sure your needs are met. My personal banker Cabrina Le, is always ready to answer my questions, and solve my problems.
