5	I love it! Seems like "healthier" chinese food. I always get shrimp fried rice with the brown rice, and YUM! Not greasy at all. Cheap, generous portions. My kids love the chicken teriyaki with the two side choices of fruit (melons, grapes) and veggies (green and red pepper chunks, broccoli, carrots slices).I just love the choice of brown rice. Tastes great, and much better for you....
3	Decent Japanese/Korean fast food. Similar in style to Chin's, although a tad more authentic. If you're out shopping at Greenway Station, this would be a good place to stop for lunch (it's across the street from Bucatini and TGI Friday's).
1	I hate to give a bad review but I tried this place twice.My first visit included a variety of appetizers. I had the crab ragoon, a sushi roll and a side salad. It was decent, nothing I couldn't live without, but checked out the rest of the menu and planned on coming back. . The second time I purchased the galbi to go. I was disappointed with the amount of meat on the beef ribs as well as the lacking of a distinct flavor.   I will not return unless someone drags me.
2	One liner:  Overpriced small bowls of Asian food.Ordered the Pad Thai. The noodles were overly cooked and completely broken.  It was a disaapointment at best.  The other thing I had issue with was the price.  Way too high for the small bowl of food I got for it. The woman at the counter was very nice and very cheerful.  If not for her, this would have gotten a 1=star.
1	This place is closed for business
3	Their fried rice probably gets five stars (they actually make the best fried brown rice I've ever had); their Korean specialties aren't bad; skip everything else.
