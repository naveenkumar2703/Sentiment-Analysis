4	A very pleasant professional shop. As has already been said, not sleazy in the slightest. A great variety of different forms of lubrication as well as plenty of toys. Also a range of poppers if you like to use them. Good selection of DVDs not just pornographic but also simply LGBT or Queer interest.In addition I also like the range of comic greetings cards and primarily use the shop for them, honest.
