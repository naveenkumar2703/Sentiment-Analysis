1	Warning: Do NOT rent anything from this company! They tried to pull a bait and switch on me by accepting a reservation for one thing, and then telling me that it was not available--only after I called and two weeks before my party.  They then tried to get me to accept a different product at a higher cost.  They totally disregarded our agreement and sent me scrambling on short notice to find a reputable company to save my kids party.
5	I absolutely love this party rental company!! I rent a bouncer with table and chairs from them every party I have. The kids always love it! They have a great variety of jumpers, combos, and water slides. Along with popcorn , cotton candy , and snow cone machines! I recommend this place to everyone looking to make a party a blast at a very descent cost! All the employee are very kind and very helpful as well! Good job CnJ. Thank you very much!
5	I had a great experience with this company! Everyone from the time I booked to the time it was dropped off were very friendly, polite and professional. It was easy to call and book a reservation. They gave me a courtesy call before dropping off the bouncer and showed up promptly. I had the bouncer overnight and they came to pick up early the next morning without me having to be there. Overall I would definitely use c&j jumpers again!
