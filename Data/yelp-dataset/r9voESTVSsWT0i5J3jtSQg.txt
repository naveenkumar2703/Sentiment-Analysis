1	SNEAKY......HORRIBLE company to deal with. My experience was sadly similar to others, I wished I had read reviews BEFORE signing anything! One line add in the yellow pages for a reasonable price. Signed the contract that came with 2 pages of fine print......one of which included AUTOMATIC RENEWAL. They charge you whether you want an ad or not! You get the bill....you are STUCK!. They will not help or do anything, it doesn't matter if the business location has moved or is nor longer in business. They want there money! Who reads the fine print while a sales rep is sitting across from you. LESSON LEARNED! SAVE YOUR TIME. MONEY.SANITY....DON'T USE DEX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	I would NEVER recommend using this company to anyone. Their customer service leaves much to be desired, when our renewal was up we told Crystal Dowdy that we wanted to change our ad and make it smaller, she kept trying to talk us into web pages and bigger, which we did not need. After telling her what changes we wanted to make, my boss asked her to send over how it would be listed. She never did so my boss just said to cancel the service. I keep getting monthly bills even though I said to cancel it. When I reached someone, funny they have no record of me canceling and I have to pay for another whole year of advertising!!!!!! Our yearly contract is up and we did not sign anything commiting to a new year. These people are absolutely nutty!!! Save your money, there are better ways to advertise!  NEVER AGAIN......I WOULD NOT LIKE TO MARK EVEN ONE STAR!
