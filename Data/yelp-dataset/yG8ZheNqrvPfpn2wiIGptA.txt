5	Went in to finally upgrade my cell phone. I guess I got tired of hearing the giggles and scoffs when I tried to use this brick of a thing to make phone calls. I don't like agreements, I don't like salesmen (on account of I've been one for most of my life), and I definitely don't like being sold. Luckily for me, the guys here are really straightforward, not overly pushy, really seem to know the products, and frankly, did a really good job. I came in and worked with Joel, and then, true to form, I balked at the price and left. Went next door to the Verizon Store. After waiting 20 minutes to even get noticed over there, I went back to Sprint to make a deal. Joel was with a customer, but the store manager Ryan actually came out and answered all my questions (of which there were many), and in the end we bought two new iPhones and a decent unlimited plan. I guess what I can say is that the customer service is way above what I've experienced before, the staff is knowledgeable, and the pricing is actually pretty fair to boot. Highly recommended.
1	I have visited with this store many times.  What I have been promised in contracts has never happened... And if you are not looking for a phone that gives the sales people a big commission, be prepared to be ignored.
1	The staff at this location are horrible and not professional at all. They are misleading not knowledge cheaters in the valley of Arizona and it seem like sprint let the ghetto Black people in that store run it. The customer service I experience today was the last time I will be there I sat and argued with them because they could not keep there word and lied about what they said!!! I recommend this store to no one don't come here because you will feel like your in the hood. What a waste of time even visiting. They lost my business forever and so I will take it else where. The worst experience ever.  They are more just concerned about the girls that walk in there with the big asses.... This store needs a whole new staff!!!!
5	I ALWAYS get the assistance I need in here and all the guys are helpful and friendly, not to mention they have the expertise to solve any phone problems I've had while in town and patiently answer my numerous questions.  I never feel like I'm being dismissed, ignored or not taken seriously.  Top notch guys with a sense of humor when I crack a joke or make a pun.  They're all good but if in doubt ask for Jesse!It's nice to be recognized when I go in even though I don't even live in town but just a visitor from San Diego.  Highly recommended all around!
1	Employees sat around watching me outside while they finished their meeting at 930 but sat and walked around the store with nothing to do..then opened the door at 10:01 spint time saying it's rule they can't help till 10..it's like gov't service.. to find out there equipment did not last even 1 yr..With a big sign hanging up saying "WE'RE HERE TO HELP. "
1	Went to get a new phone there was only one guy working the others were in the back. Waited for 5mins then left.
