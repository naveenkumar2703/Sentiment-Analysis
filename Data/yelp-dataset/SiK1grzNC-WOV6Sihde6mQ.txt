5	Best shaved ice ever.  I am a fan of shaved ice.  This is the best in Vegas.  And, I would say that it is better than the ones I have had in Hawaii.  Try it!  Just wish there were more locations.
5	Next best thing to Waiola ,and Matsumoto in Hawaii - great job!!   ate 2 of them today.the price's are even better well worth it. I'll be back
5	My previous experiences with shaved ice were from vendors at amusement parks and at sports arenas. I'd never been very impressed because those snow cones seemed like little more than crunchy, ground-up ice doused in sickly-sweet syrup (I mean you, neon blue raspberry). BingBings is completely different!The texture of the shaved ice served is not chunky or crunchy at all. On the contrary, after a few spoonfuls I understood why this dessert is often called "snow cones" - it really tastes like a mound of fluffy, fresh snow. Paired with fruit syrups it's an amazingly refreshing treat.I had a chance to try two flavors: Dragon's blood (my birth year, I had to) and POG which I'm told stands for Peach/Orange/Guava. Both were delicious.Hopefully we see additional locations soon.
