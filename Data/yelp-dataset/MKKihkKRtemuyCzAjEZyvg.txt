1	I give this review a total 1 star If I was able to, I would have rated no stars at all!.... I would NEVER reccomend ANYONE to live here. The office staff is horrible and made me feel uncomfortable the whole year I lived there based on THEIR MISTAKES! I can not express how disappointed I am with the way that they have treated me.....
5	Lived in this place almost 3 years.  I love this place, the prices are reasonable for the sizes.  The office staff were wonderful, and friendly.  Whenever something needed to be fixed it was done efficient and correctly compared to other places I lived.  If I moved back to az, and rented this would be the place I would live.
3	So far so good.  Just signed a lease and started moving stuff in.  Staff is nice.  Havent really met many neighbors yet but so far so good!
