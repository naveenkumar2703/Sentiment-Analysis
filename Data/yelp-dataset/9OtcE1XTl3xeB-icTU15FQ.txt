3	There is nothing special about Pick Up Stix.  The food is pretty standard and nothing is extremely good.  It acts and tastes like Pei Wei but without the obnoxious layout.  The food comes out quick and is decently priced.  The Pick Up Stix on 67th is the first one I had ever been to.  We would usually call ahead and they would always have our order ready for us when we arrived.  Orange chicken and the Honey chicken are two of my favorites although they are a far cry from the Chinese food at China Chili.This place is always reliable for quick food when I am in NoPho.
1	This place should be called Pick up Sodium.    Everything is over seasoned and high in Sodium.    The Beef and Broccli has 2190 grams of sodium on a 620 calorie dish!    The chicken teriyaki bowl with white rice has 4200 grams.   Samurai Sam's chicken teriyaki bowl, large has 940 grams, while the regular bowl has 520 grams.   Skip this place.
4	We love Pick Up Stix!!! Everything is wok made for you when you order it. Their chicken entrees are very good, but I always order Buddha's Feast, a vegetable dish. You have your choice of white or brown rice with every meal. Excellent food - well worth the visit!!
2	Can't believe how bad this place is as far as order accuracy and priority.  Watched a 3-top get their food before mine, and I had one simple order.  Then some guy storms in, complains his takeout order was wrong, and then people who order after him wait forever to get their food.  It's as if we all lose at this place.Food is nothing special either, a clearly inferior option to Pei Wei across the street in both quality and service.  Some of the folks working there are polite, but politeness doesn't make your tummy ache go away when you see groups of people who ordered after you receive their food first.
