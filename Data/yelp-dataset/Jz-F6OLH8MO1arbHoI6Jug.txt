4	We are BIG fans of Area 51 as well as the former 21st Century Antiques, and everything that we have bought from Michael over 20 years in Madison is not only worth a great deal MORE than we paid for them, WE love them even more than when we bought them and couldn't find them again.Michael has a fantastic eye and the largest warehouse collection of eclectic modern furnishings, lighting and accessories in the area - art deco, arts & crafts, industrial-mid-mod century. Best to call for an appointment as hours are varied. Bring your truck, tape measure and imagination as Area51 of course has a lot of truly one of a kind BIG pieces in addition to upscale kitsch, whimsy and collectible bling.
2	Would love to see the place and browse, but despite what the Yelp page says, their web site is quite clear that there are no regular hours. "By Chance or Appointment". Well, I'm not up for driving several miles and using up expensive gas just to see if anyone is there, and I've left voicemail messages to make an appointment but no one returns the call. Also added my name to the "mail list" form, but haven't ever received anything. In 25 years of collecting, I've discovered that mid century modern dealers can be somewhat flaky, so I wasn't too surprised. Still, I wish they'd get their act together so people could spend money there.
