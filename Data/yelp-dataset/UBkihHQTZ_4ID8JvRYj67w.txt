5	Best trainer I've ever had!!  Zach is efficient, effective and customizes every workout!  Great with rehabbing injuries like my knee!  Also, offers a kickboxing class that is wonderful all body workout and fun!
5	worked with Zach and did the 24 day challenge with him. got great results and am now bikini ready for summer! would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to use a trainer or take some fun classes. gym is clean and personal which is great for me cuz I don't like the typical crowded gym environment!
5	Worked out with Zac for well over two years. He assisted me in reaching my personal goals. For those days that I wasn't sooooo motivated as we all can be from time to time. Well let's just Zac wouldn't stand for it and kept me on track. Through the ups and downs of my scale. Zac kept me on the prize and met my goals every step of the way. I highly recommend Zac and trust his routines to get you and every other person out there to get your Buns in the air. - Mama Hernandez aka April
