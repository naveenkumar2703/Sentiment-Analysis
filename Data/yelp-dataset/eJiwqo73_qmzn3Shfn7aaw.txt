5	This review is for the Gas Station here in Chandler. It is the best priced gas I have found this week.Just $2.95 a gallon. I have a truck so it takes a lot of gas. This place is a huge help.You can pay with a few different cards but, you must scan your Sam's Club card first.They have great hours, they are open a lot. Not on Holidays though,such as Christmas and New Years.Which is the way it should be. You can also get a car wash while you are here. For only $6.00. They have a few different choices, it is the kind that you drive thru yourself.It is a great deal! What more can you ask for, If you are over in that part of town it works out really well.
5	Sam's club gas is the best part of Sam's club and is a must stop every time I go to Sam's club. The last time I went the prices of premium (the downside of a nice car) was a quarter cheaper than the going rate elsewhere.
4	Nice station. Wish they had Window squeegee so I could've scrubbed all the bugs off! Sams does have best Prices. Was 3.54 today for 91 octane. I will definitely venture to this fuel station though from now on!
