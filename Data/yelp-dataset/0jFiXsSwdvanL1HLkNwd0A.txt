1	What a joke.... $19 for a man's hair cut... yeah the first time it's "free" (plus tip) with the massage, face towel, and all that... then the more you go back the less you get... So we paid $19 to run a #2 over his head with nothing else?  Done with this one, and done referring friends (which we were told if you referred two friends you got another free hair cut... like that happened)... so allegedly "cute" girls in short shorts cutting hair is draw I guess...but keep the customer service up to speed along with it and you might get customers not complaining.

1	What a lousy experience!  I went in to get a hair cut.  They don't take appointments but you can put your name on a list.  The bad thing is that if you're sitting there waiting, the people on the list can come back ANYTIME they want and get in front of those who have been waiting!  I expressed my dissatisfaction about that and one of the stylists (Grace) thought it was funny.  Nice!  Suffice it to say I won't be going back here!
5	I come here when I need my hair cut or trimmed.  The hair stylist know how I want my hair. Certain way.  I know when I go and get my hair cut I will come out with my hair looking nice.  The employees are very friendly and nice.
