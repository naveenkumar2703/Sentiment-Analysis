5	Quality service at an affordable price.  Puddle Jumper goes out of their way to make the customer happy.  Even after the giant dust storms last summer!
5	I have been using Eric's Pool services for over 5 years on all the homes that I manage. He is very knowledgeable and fair on his prices. I trust Eric to not only clean my pools, but refer him to my clients as well.
1	Beware of this pool service. They create "fines" for an extra buck and on things which past pool services have just considered to be part of the job. I highly recommend you use pretty much ANY other pool service.
5	I've seen first hand the work and quality Puddle Jumper Pool Service has performed and it's top notch! Why go with a corporation and be just another dollar bill when you can have great personal attention from a family owned and run business?! Give them a call, you won't be sorry!
5	Eric services 44 pools for me.....yeah you read that right....forty four! Message me if you don't believe me and want addresses and I'll send you a few! =) His knowledge of pools, equipment and chemicals is pretty awesome and I'm constantly impressed. He has the unique ability to resolve issues in a cost effective manner which as a landlord, I greatly value. I've gone through many vendors here in AZ and have kept my business with him. That alone is a testament to his value.
