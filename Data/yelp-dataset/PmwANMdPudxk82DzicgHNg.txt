3	The Murrayfield area of town has a small parade of shops, with the ubiquitous newsagents.  This one doesn't seem to have a name, instead being known only as 'Edinburgh Newsagent.'  Inside, there is nothing out of the ordinary, and you'll find your normal supply of sweets, magazines, drinks, snacks and assorted random newsagents things.  As I've always said with these places, you forget they're there until you really need them.  But once you've seen one, you've seen them all to be honest.  They even look the same from the outside.A good place for the bare essentials.
4	My fairly high degree of hostility to the sport of Rugby ensures I don't spend a great deal of time in this part of town, especially on Saturdays around February / March, but as I've got a couple of pals who live around the Haymarket area I do pass by on occasion, and invariably into this newsagent for chewing gum / a paper / a bottle of water.It's just a bog-standard newsagent, but scores a bonus point for comedy value as I was once served by a guy who was reading The Daily Sport. He didn't even take his eyes off the massive knockers, which were clearly made out of something from a vat at ICI, once during the transaction. Appalling customer service, but funny nonetheless.
2	Arhh, the Roseburn Newsagents (yup, that's what they call themselves, very imaginative folk!). Wedged in-between a very good Scotmid and an ok Spar, the RN seems to do an ok trade selling the stock standard products in papers, grog, magazines, drinks and sweets. Their prices are slightly higher than Spar and quite a bit higher than Scotmid, yet they always seem to have folk in their store???It cannot be for the banter, as I can assure you they willingly provide jack...perhaps it's due to they being the only ones to sell phone cards...??? I cannot work it out myself, but fair dues to them all the same.
