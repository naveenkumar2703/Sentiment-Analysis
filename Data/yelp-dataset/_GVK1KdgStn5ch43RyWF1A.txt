5	I found Dr. Swenson's office out of sheer luck. Sick as a dog, suffering from seasonal allergies so badly that I thought I had pneumonia (what?), I scoured my insurance company's Web site for a doctor who could see me. Incidentally, I'd already had two laughable trips to Urgent Care under my belt and was out a hundred bucks. I got an appointment with Dr. Swenson and left feeling better already. The office is spotless, the staff friendly, accommodating and uber-efficient. Dr. Swenson is kind, confident, and knowledgeable without so much as a trace of ego. He listens intently, asks questions, offers and discusses options, walks through them, and, best of all, he doesn't keep you waiting forever. I also go to Dr. Swenson's colleague Tom Willim for allergy treatment and have found their chosen method (sublingual drops) to be highly effective. North Scottsdale Family Medical Center has helped me with a variety of things, so much so that I've recommended them to several family and friends. Now I'm recommending them to you. Trust me on this one.
5	Dr. Swenson really surprised me considering he actually took the time out to listen to what I (as a patient) had to say. I rarely have that experience like most patients. The staff and NSFMC are very kind and patient too. If you do not have insurance, they will work with you as well! Highly recommend Dr Swenson.
3	It's a nice office and building. When I went to get my blood drawn at Sonoran I was in and out without making an appointment. The staff is quick and to the point. They are sweet as well so it makes the visit more enjoyable.
