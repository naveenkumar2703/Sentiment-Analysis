2	i don't know why jack in the box is hyped up so much, i blame george lopez for talking about them in his comedy skits.badplace was very small, dark, slow service. food was edible (barely), i kept spitting out my hamburger b/c the meat was chewy.goodcheapwasted a dinner in vegas here...FAYUL
3	Okay, so this spot is a little shady. I have seen crack heads meet in the bathroom to do drug buys, hookers and pimps, panhandlers, you name it.It's all about the entertainment at this location for me. Okay, sometimes they are not the cleanest, nor the fastest when you are inside. However, drive thru is always good here. Minus when they give me 1 packet of taco sauce for when I order four tacos. I always, always ask for extra taco sauce at this location now.So if you like the JIB food and don't mind people watching, then this is the spot for you!!
3	I was on the way to pick up a friend from the airport and my son and I were starving, knowing it'd be a long night, figured I should feed us before we get our friends. There was no line on the drive through, my food was made on order and we were on our way.Oh how I wish pumpkin pie milk shakes where year round.
1	Worst JITB ever. Slow and rude employees.
1	Horrible maintainence inside. Spilled coffee partially cleaned up.  Missing ceiling tiles. Some places were empty holes where insulation could rain down on your food, other places the ceiling tiles were replaced with garbage bags and duct tape that was falling down. I threw most of my food away for fear of food poisoning. If it is that bad in the dining room, I can't imagine how bad the back kitchen is. Don't be fooled by the newly remodeled exterior.
5	My five stars are for the big smile I got this morning from the drive thru employee. He was so friendly. Made my day and surprised me because the usual drive thru faces I see are grumpy and impatient. It was refreshing to see someone so happy.
