5	I attended my first class at Yoga Den this evening with a wonderful instructor named Piper.  The studio just opened their doors this past Saturday and currently offers a few classes per day.  It's a welcomed (and much needed) addition to our downtown area and I'm looking forward to exploring the other classes they have to offer.  It's a small space, but has a nice energy and the owners are incredibly friendly.
5	I have been lucky enough to attend several classes here. Very clean studio, but very intimate setting (smaller classes, which is a nice change from what I have experienced). The owners are wonderful people, and the teachers are so good, too! The teachers make each class "custom" for the students that are attending the sessions. Great downtown location. Cannot beat the price, either. Definitely recommend this to anyone.
5	just left their pilates class this morning after buying the living social deal and let me tell you!!!!  LOVED this....first time doing pilates but I am already a fan and I loved rachel who was our instructor.  great little studio, very welcoming and excited to have each student.  can't wait to go back :)
