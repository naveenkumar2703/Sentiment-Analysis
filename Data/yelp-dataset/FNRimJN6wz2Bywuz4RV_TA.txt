5	First of all, I've been recommending this place repeatedly to everyone I know since it opened a couple of months ago--it's really close to my apartment and I LOVE it, so I want everyone else to go and ensure its success so I can keep eating there.The menu is very simple, but it offers a wide array of choices.  A previous reviewer complained that they had to "make too many decisions," but I see that as a positive.  The menu allows you to mix and match pastas or cuts of meat (fish, chicken, steak--portobella for vegetarians) with various sauces, all of which are really delicious.  You can also do a build your own pizza, and I know from experience that they're very accommodating about doing a topping that's not actually on the menu--bleu wasn't listed in the cheeses, but they were happy to put it on a pizza for me.Their breakfast menu is a similar model, but they have nice classic entrees like eggs benedict and scramblers.  I got one made with only egg whites (they also offer Egg Beaters), and it was delicious and HUGE--I saved half of it for breakfast the next day and it reheated well.  This is typical of their entrees; the prices are quite reasonable ($10-$16 for most entrees) and virtually everything will make at least two meals.  Their biscuits are awesome; I highly recommend them as a side.I also particularly recommend: their coffee (I had the medium roast; they also have a dark one), their pesto sauce for pasta, their eggplant "meatballs" (delicious even to non-vegetarians like me and my boyfriend), their french fries (moderately thick-cut), and their wine selection ($5-8 a glass, and all very nice).I would avoid: their bacon (not very crisp) and the pomegranate martini (almost bitter and not very strong).It does seem to me that a lot of their staff is fairly new, but everyone who's served me there has been very friendly and attentive and worked very hard to ensure that I had a great meal there.I haven't had a chance to try their bag lunches, but they look good (you can also build your own sandwich at lunchtime).  They also do take-out, so you can call ahead and place an order to pick up, which is easy and fast.
