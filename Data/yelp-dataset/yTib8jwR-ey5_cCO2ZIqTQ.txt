5	I love this store!!!When I first moved here to Las Vegas, there wasn't a huge variety of stores and shops that you could go to for your "Island Creations" :) THis shop has everything from clothing, DVDs, CDs, household decor, jewlery, shoes, art, Artificial leis and just recently started carrying Fresh Lei's made by Las Vegas Lei's. The owners are really nice and will answer any quesitons that you have!!! The aloha in this place will make you feel welcome. Its a small little shop located in a little shopping center where the green valley grocery gas station is.
5	Oka... This is a wonderful store. Lil Man and I went to visit yesterday so that I could pay for the fresh leis that I ordered for June. Comes to find out that the owners of the store is my auntie and uncle from my dad's side of the family.  Auntie Tina and Uncle Larry. They have alot of wonderful Samoan items for sale such as the Samoan combs, the beautiful flowers to wear in your ear. They have everything that I miss which includes puletasis, leis, purses, lava lavas, jewelry, music, and much much more. The best part of our visit was talking with Auntie Tina about many things such as life, God, goals, family, and much much more. Auntie Tina is such a wonderful woman who gave a lot of advice to Lil Man. Fa'afetai, Auntie.
5	I love this store, lots of fun tropical type stuff, every now and then I pop in to see what's new, it's a cute little family owned business that I feel good supporting.
