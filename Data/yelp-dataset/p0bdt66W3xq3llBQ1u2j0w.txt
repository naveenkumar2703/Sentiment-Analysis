4	Annie's is awesome. We take our dog Daisy  here on a weekly basis to get groomed. They do a great job and they are very attentive to special requests. (Cutting her toenails makes her chew them so no more of that). She always comes home with a different bandana, holiday/season themed, which is a nice touch.  I recently took our puggle to get her nails trimmed (trust me that is no easy feat). They did a great job and only charged me $5.I highly recommend Annie's to anyone in the neighborhood.
1	Sorry Annie but I'm docking stars. While the grooming continues to be well done the new cash only policy is frustrating. The last time I came to pick up Daisy they told me the debit machine was down. I had no cash and asked if I could pay them next time, they said no and that I could come by anytime before 5 to drop it off. It was an incredible inconvenience and considering it was their fault I couldn't pay they should have let me pay the next time I came in. As previously mentioned I have been bringing Daisy here every week for over a year. It has been about a month now and the debit machine is still "down".They have lost my business and I will find another place to take the dogs. If they show me no love why should I continue to give them my money!
5	Annie's Pet Parlor has always impressed us.  They are kind and gentle.  We plan ahead so paying with cash has never been a problem.
5	We have a big old Old English sheepdog.  They did a wonderful job with him-besides looking "gorgeous", he was relaxed and seemed to enjoy the experience.  Length of time and price also a plus.
