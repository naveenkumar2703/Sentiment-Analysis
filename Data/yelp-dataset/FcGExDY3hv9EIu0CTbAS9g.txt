2	I hate the west side. Sorry west siders. That being said, I give every west side place a fair chance. This Subway had workers that were clearly not excited to be there. I understand you work at Subway, and that it's kind of a thankless job sometimes but c'mon.
4	Went here on a Sunday afternoon, and only one employee was working. The line was long, but she kept her attitude up and got through everyone's orders flawlessly. Clean restaurant, clean bathrooms, good lacation.
1	I wanted to pick some up for lunch on my way to work but these that is very rude I would never be back, I asked for one more napkin and she told me NO !
1	These people here are the rudest you'll ever get,I happened to walk by the door and I seen up assuming it's the owner to same lady I always see so I did not go in that's the mean one.
1	I'm here with some seniors I took them to lunch this place I hate so much the service here sucks really bad and the owner is wicked lady shouldn't even have the business, I would avoid the subway there are many other subways in the valley that is much better than this place this lady here is mean mean or than dirt she won't even give you extra napkins.
