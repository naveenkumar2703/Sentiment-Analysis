5	Run by one guy (Dale).  We've lived here since 8/2001 and have had a variety of vehicles - he's done the tint on all of them.  He does a great job, takes pride in his work, and is very reliable.
5	We have utilized Dale for all of our tinting in our home and our family vehicles. Very relible while providing quality work at a fair price. Strongly recommend!
