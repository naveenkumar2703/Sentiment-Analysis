4	Amazing!My battery was dying. Not only did the guy (I believe his name was Adam) check my battery for me, but he also showed me how a lot of mechanics might try to screw me over by setting the battery tester incorrectly so that it would show a bad battery even if it was a good battery.  Wow!  Thank you!Secondly, I expected to have to buy a new battery.  He double checked for me and determined that we bought that battery at another Auto Zone and it was still covered under warranty!  Free battery!To top it off, he installed the new battery for me and attached a temporary charger to the vehicle to make sure it didn't lose a charge, as my vehicle might have gone all wiggy if it was without power for too long.I told him, and I was being 100% honest, that if I carried cash, I would've given him a tip!  He said it wasn't necessary and that our family has done enough with my husband being military.  Yes, we also had a friendly conversation as he installed my new battery.  He was just all around friendly.
2	Take my advice and if you have questions don't rely on any employee here to give you the right item. I was being helped by a manager and still was directed to the wrong filter. That was after he inspected the current one under my hood!! Also returning to pick up a battery within two hours, the guy working with my friend had totally forgotten who he was. He had just dealt with him and helped him out for 20 minutes. Facial recognition is important to me in customer service.The main reason this location gets 2 stars, is the inconvenience of getting all the way home, to find out the filter you were told to buy is nowhere close to the right size and having to return it with no apology...
4	Always a very helpful staff.
