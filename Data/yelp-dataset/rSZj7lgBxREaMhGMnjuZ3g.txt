4	Although I am going to swear off fast food I stop in to see Jack for lunch. Got my normal Burger, Seasoned fries, motts sticks, and the Death by Chocolate treat. The girl on the Speaker was clear and got my order right, it was out the window and in my hands under 3 minutes.
3	2am Taco fix?????Look no further than Jack in the Box to help soak up your booze filled tummy and make you feel much better in the am.I won't condone eating here when you are sober unless you are really in need of something fast.
2	Take Two for the seach of the smoothie.  Since being let down yesterday getting my smoothie for breakfast, I decided to hit up this location a short jaunt from the house, but on the way to work.  I order at the drive-thru this morning a small Strawberry Banana Smoothie.  Get to the window and am told.  Its not ready.  It will be in 15 minutes.  I say thanks and drive off.   DAYUM!  Cant a pregnant woman fulfill a breakfast craving?!  You'd think that with a 24hr drive-thru operation that they'd have an item ready that would more likely than not, be consumed during breakfast hours!!
4	Not too bad after a night of partying. I went here around 2 a.m.  There was a line, but it progressed quickly. The sirloin burger was accurate to my order.  I expected the burger to be a little bigger... The fried were hot. It's fast food (that I don't need) so what else can I say?!
4	For what it is, Jack in the Box hits the spot. I tend to stay far away from fast food places but Jack is the closest place to grub by my house and the breakfast menu is decent/served all day. Cheap food, good service, and convenient makes it alright in my book.
