5	Theresa is amazing! I have really sensitive skin and she is very careful and selective on what she uses. It's not just a great facial but she usually throws in a head/neck shoulder massage too. The prices are very reasonable for what you get! I bought a friend a gift certificate for her very first facial here. She said it was the most amazing and relaxing experience she has ever had!! Highly recommend Theresa and Plumberry!!
5	I had a wonderful facial and Theresa really took the time to discuss my skin and made recommendations for products that I love to use.
5	Theresa is AMAZING! I always look forward to get my facials done with her, she gives the most relaxing facials ever, every time I go, I always fall asleep!! When you first enter her suite, it's such an inviting atmosphere, she will then ask you if you would like to change in to a towel wrap, which I LOVE it give me the whole spa experience!  Theresa introduced my Osmosis skin care products and I love them! Every time I leave her suite my skin looks amazing!  Theresa is the best!
