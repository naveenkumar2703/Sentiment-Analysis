3	An interactive driving range with food and alcohol.It is like playing Tiger Woods with an live inteface that uses your golf swing warts and all. Its a lot of fun. Beer and Tvs in every booth makes this a nice alternative to golfing when its 300 degrees outside (though I am a fan of Summer golf and I dont drink when I play either)So, check it out.
4	Do the skins game every week.
4	Fun novelty!We set up a tee time in advance and we arrived a little early and were still able to get into a booth right away.  The service seemed a little unfriendly at first but she warmed up as the night went along.  The golf itself is very interesting...you're set up into a booth that's closed off on all sides but the entrance and you hit from various artificial turfs (depending on your lie).  You aim at a large screen that has an image projected onto it of the course as you would see it in real life.  Changing the direction of your aim or whether to chip/pitch or putt is controlled by you via computer.  Putting is fairly easy as you only have to get within 6 feet of the hole to count it.We ordered Blue Moon and the IPA by the pitcher and had a good time with it.  The food, on the other hand, was borderline average/poor.  We had planned on eating dinner here along with golf and I was a little disappointed in the quality of the food.  We did sample a few different items including the nachos, burgers and chicken strips dinner.  Nothing was particularly fresh and it all tasted as if it was simply frozen dinners.  Summary:  Great time for friends to hang out and drink some beer.  Head someplace else for dinner when you're done!
