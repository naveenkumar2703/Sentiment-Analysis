5	My oh My! If you're in Las Vegas and love cross stitch, do NOT miss this shop. The front of the shop has got the more current charts/little kits/seasonal charts so you have to run the gauntlet of great stuff before you can even greet the shop owner. Check out the beautiful models, most stitched by the owner's business partner. But duck into the side room and take in the fabulous selection of fabrics! This is a stash-builder store for sure. The owner was knowledgeable and patient. Note that this shop is NOT the internet shop with the same name but brick and mortar only, though phone orders and shipping are offered.
4	This is my mom's favorite stitching store and she comes here regularly. On Wednesdays they have stitch-ins which she enjoys.I'm not a stitcher so the only time I come is to buy her a gift card. That's what she always wants for a present so I come in around her birthday, Christmas, and Mother's Day.The staff is always nice and helpful. 9 times out of 10, as soon as I walk in they say, "You must be related to Margie. You look just like her."I'm certainly no expert on stitching stores but they seem to have a good selection of patterns, threads, and material.
5	This is the only cross stitch store in Las Vegas.  That said, I don't think we need another one.  Stitcher's Paradise has everything I need for my cross stitching needs, and what they don't have they are happy to special-order!  Threads, patterns, and so many lovely fabrics!  I feel inspired every time in walk in the door!  The ladies here are always so helpful and happy to lend their opinion and expertise  when asked.  If you're coming from out of town, stop in and you'll feel like you're home.
