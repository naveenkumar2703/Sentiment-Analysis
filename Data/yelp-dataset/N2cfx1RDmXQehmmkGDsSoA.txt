4	I don't have much to say about this gas station, other than the fact that I added it to Yelp, because it's a Chevron, and I wanted other people to be able to find it.  Hooray!
3	Just your normal gas station, always busy an they have alot of options for snacks!
4	I got diesel at this "Chevron" in Chandler, AZ on 12/11/2009 for my R.V. "The Black Pearl".  It was my first time there.  The prices were competitive.
4	Great location right off Loop-101 and Chandler Blvd.  The only con about this location is that it took forever to fill up as the speed of the pump is very slow.  But other than that, great price.  You pay different prices for the lowest grade if you pay with cash instead of credit/debit.
4	Caused me a bit of panic when I checked my credit card and noticed a charge 2.1x what I paid for here during a roadtrip stopover. I immediately called and was told the manager is in from 6AM-12PM daily, but was also informed that cards from out of state/out of country will always get a hold of 24-48 hours before clearing. The person I talked to told me that I should just wait and monitor my account for the purchase to post, but also reassured me that I could call back if the amount was incorrect after the holding time. The customer service provided was excellent - unlike most others who would have probably answered my concerns with "so?"
