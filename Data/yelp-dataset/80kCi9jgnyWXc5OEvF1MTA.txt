4	Conveniently located on Madison's near north side, Drackenberg's is home of a large selection of fine cigars and a wide assortment of domestic, imported, (and exotic) wines, beers, and liquors...that was from their website...truth.  I love this bar.  Jackson and his staff are both amiable and knowledgeable.  Which is very difficult to find on the fashionable East side of Madison.  The beer selection rotates regularly and is always capable of accompanying a fine cigar.  Jackson has also stocked the bar with an extensive amount of wines and liquors... If you are looking for it... He's probably got it back there somewhere.  Sometimes it can get a bit smokey in the establishment... but hey... it's a cigar bar...what would you expect?
4	Nice location on the north side of Madison. I desperately with I knew it was there the seven years I lived on the north side!Jackson and the rest of the staff are very friendly, and the selection at the bar is nice - they've got one of the largest whisky lists I've seen in the area. If you're not sure what you want, in either a drink or a cigar, Jackson or one of the bartenders can probably give you a useful recommendation.The humidor, while small, is generally well-stocked, if a tiny bit on the dry side humidity-wise.One of my favorite places in town to hang out with friends and enjoy a cigar and drinks.
