3	The Jasmine is a handily located Chinese restaurant for a quick bite to eat before a trip to the theatre; the Usher Hall, Traverse and Lyceum are all within a stone's throw. There is an air of oriental charm about the place, it is smartly and cleanly decorated and the staff are efficient and professional. I have eaten here a few times (mostly at my sister's insistence), but can't really find any discerning features; everything is 'nice', but nothing is terribly exciting. I have never had a bad experience, but I have never experienced anything amazing either.
