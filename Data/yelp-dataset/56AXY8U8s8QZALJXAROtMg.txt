2	I took pictures while at this location last week. Its a ok store didn't care for the staff attitudes tho so I give it 2stars.
2	The shoes are disorganized.  Often the wrong size in the wrong box.  The staff is pleasant enough but do not seem to know anything about the shoes.  There is no one to help get shoes down from the top of the shelving and sometimes no employee to be seen for 5-10 minutes at a time.  The prices are mostly reasonable which saves this place from a one star rating and the shoes last a decent amount of time especially the kids shoes.  The selection is severely lacking.
3	I agree with the staff review...very plain and robotic. Payless has come a far way. I never used to shop for shoes here because they were such cheap quality but have gotten a lot better!! I come here mainly for the jewelry! Great prices and cute styles!
2	What's missing here? Service.  I can usually find a pair of cute shoes anywhere.  Payless had mailed out a coupon so I decided to stop in.  This store wasn't as clean and organized as others.  Luckily I still found some cute ones! When I went up to pay, she was on the phone.  I could tell it was a personal call as she wasn't talking about anything shoe related.  I waited until she finally put her friend on hold.  The second she finished ringing me up, she was back on the phone.  Not a thank you or any smile.  It was very unprofessional and rude.  I'm hoping they can improve the service and organization here.  A little bit can go a long way.
