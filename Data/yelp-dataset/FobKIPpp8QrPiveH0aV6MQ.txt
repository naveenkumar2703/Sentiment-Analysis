5	They replaced the clutch in my 2003 toyota matrix in the same day and even offered to pick up me up at home after the car as repaired. All charges were clearly explained and everyone was professional. I am satisfied with the service.
5	Stopped in for a service quote on my vehicle. The level of honesty and integrity of this establishment impressed me. The quoted price was reasonable and far lower than other shops because he is not charging me for unnecessary items as the dealer was going to! I would highly recommend this establishment based on its sound ethical business principles/
5	My favorite shop in Vegas to take my car. Very caring and trustworthy shop owner and mechanics. I've taken my car here for the past few years from oil changes to belt replacements. Prices are very reasonable.
