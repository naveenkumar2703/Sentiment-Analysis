5	If you like fast cars, no hassles, and no hidden fees this place is for you! I've always wanted to drive a Lamborghini and it certainly didn't disappoint! David was extremely kind, helpful, and knowledgeable about the car which was great.  Will most definitely be returning to rent the Ferrari! Thanks again David for making my birthday very memorable!
5	I bought the rental for my boyfriend's birthday as a surprise.  He was surprised!  Absolutely loved it!  He couldn't believe that we got to take a Lambo out on the town by ourselves.  David was extremely helpful in setting up my surprise and went over very thoroughly over how to drive the car.  Amazing experience!  Definitely will be back.
