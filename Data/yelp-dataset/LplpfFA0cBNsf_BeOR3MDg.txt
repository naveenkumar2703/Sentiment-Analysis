1	eh.. this isnt such a bad hotel, but it can use some improvements. there hall way stinks like smoke and wet carpet. i dont know why they have smoking and non smoker room after every other room. its so retarded... but oh well.. you get what you pay for.. the up side is FREE BREAKFAST!
1	Stayed here with a friend for a few nights just passing through. I managed to forget my laptop charger in the room. It is an Apple laptop charger which run about $80 per. I immediately called as soon as I realized and was on the road an hour away. So i asked that I could please be charged to mail it to California. The first girl I spoke to laughed at me on the phone but did say she found it. I had 3 different people tell me they had it in their hands. I gave all my info and everything and now they said it was never found. Call me paranoid but it sounds like somebody got themselves a brand new charger.
