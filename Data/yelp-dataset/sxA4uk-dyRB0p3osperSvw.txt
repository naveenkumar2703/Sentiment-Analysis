4	The office is very clean and tidy. The office staff is polite & friendly too.
5	I came here for a medical evaluation for a job I am applying to. I am not a person who gets nervous about anything medical, but it is nice to have any nervousness assuaged by good staff and a clean property.I had to be tested for my hearing, eyesight, and for drugs. Ya, I know most of you know what that means. Anyway, the girl who worked with me was really nice and knew what she was doing. I felt as though I was in good hands.The exam room was clean and sterile and the doctor was quick and efficient. I don't think there's much more you can ask for in an exam room and wellness center.
1	This place is horrible if you're sent here by your employer for a work injury, just go to the emergency room or your own doctor.  The staff here is rude,  you literally wait for hours to he seen.  Dr.  Klausner will delay getting you xrays, mris and anything that costs extra just to save money,  and he will try to send you back to work while your still in pain or still injured.  Avoid pain and aggravation,  go somewhere else.
1	I arrived fifteen minutes early. I was not seen until an hour and a half after my appt time. I walked in after a lady. She left I still was not seen until twenty minutes after she left. The office was clean, service in my opinion was poor.
