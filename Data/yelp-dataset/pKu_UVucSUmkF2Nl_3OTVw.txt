5	The wifey and I hit Vegas for a quick weekend getaway. We decided that we wanted to check out some awesome shops in the new City Centre as well as do a little bit of gambling and eat at some great restaurants.  Since I'm a huge watch freak, I had to pop into this place.  Wow! What an awesome selection of high end watches!! (ie: Richard Mille is just one brand) John was the person who helped us. Super nice.  Allowed me to try on a selection of timepieces I would never have seen elsewhere.  I highly recommend Radiance and make sure you ask for John.
3	I love high end watches.  Every time I'm in Aria, I walk into this shops since they have some nice ones.  Hublot and Breitling are two examples of the brand they carry.  But because you're in Vegas, many high end watch stores are available.  Their prices are on par with the other stores.  They will give discounts for M Life Rewards members (casino rewards program), but only if you are a high end gambler.  I'm not.  The have good selections of the brands they carry but don't have many other high end watches that you can find in other shops.  Nonetheless, I still like walking in and looking at them.
1	Have you ever been wrongly judged by a retail salesperson who is just standing around in the show room doing absolutely nothing other than waiting to take a turn in their up system rotation???This review is for Sean.I walked in to look at a Hublot watch and not only did Sean reluctantly take the watch out of the case (after sizing me up and wrongly determining that I was not able to buy a Hublot watch), but he had the audacity to ask me if I was really going to come back when I asked him for his card!!! Similarly to the Pretty Woman principle, I walked out of that store and thank God I got my Rolex elsewhere, O Yeah Sean, it's because I CAN afford a good watch.
