5	As a Massage therapist I really need to get worked on to make up for all the massages I give.  Kristi is my go-to massage therapist.   With over 20 years of experience in the healing arts she's got amazing strength and sensitivity.   AND--she's a great listener--it's kind of like getting a counselor and therapist all in one shot.  It's the best hour of my week!  "
5	Kristi is amazing when it comes to massage.  I went to see her for one of her aromatherapy relaxing massages and was in total bliss!  After a stressful day of running appointments for work and taking care of my three year old I can't imagine a better way to end my week!
5	I have enjoyed working with Kristi Dee Doden and The Mindful Way for about 10 years. I have had the benefit of her skills as both a massage therapist and a communications coach. While I always enjoy her body work, through Kristi's workshops, I have learned tools on how to relate compassionately to myself and ultimately to others. This has had the most impact on me. I appreciate her ability to hold a sense of safety for me when issues feel overwhelming. I trust that she can help me find a win-win result to particularly emotional situations. I experience great personal growth under Kristi's guidance and I find myself turning to her often for support and clarity. She is a very effective listener and I am glad that I have found her in my life.
