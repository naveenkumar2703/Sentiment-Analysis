4	Honestly, I was very surprised that Blockbuster Video stores still exist! Upon walking into the store a rush of memories rushed through my mind, reminding me of my childhood in California. My family used to frequent Blockbuster stores because they always had an amazing selection of movies (new and old) as well as video games! I immediately signed up for a new membership and began exploring the store. This particular store is on the medium side. While it does have a pretty large selection, it did not compare to the size of the Blockbuster I used to go to in California. The DVDs are organized alphabetically based off genre and the newer titles are lined against the walls, so it's pretty easy to find what you're looking for in the store. Sadly, they didn't have The Notebook, but I was able to easily find another movie to satisfy my "sappy, hopeless romantic" needs.I'll definitely be coming here when I have a random urge to watch a movie. This location is down the street from my apartment, so it definitely gets a star for convenience! If you need to rent a movie or feel like staying in and having a movie date, be sure to check out this location!
3	Like all Blockbuster locations, this one is closing and therefore everything must go. Unfortunately, nothing is really priced to sell yet. The videos are still a little on the expensive side and even the video games and fixtures were not impressively priced. I'm sure as the weeks go by they will lower the prices, but so far, they aren't there yet.
