4	I love this store they have an awesome stuff for interior decorating.and for any holiday occasions.
5	This staff are always so nice and so helpful.  I've been shopping at that store for the past 7 years. :) And even though the staff changes, but they're always very nice.
2	For a furniture store this place gets a score of zero stars as they don't have any.As a home decor store I give it a two, because at least they carry those items, atrocious as they may be to the senses. We walked in and right out, as the smell of something (candles? Potpourri? Formaldehyde?) was so overwhelming I had to get out of there ASAP. Maybe you'll have better luck or not as sensitive of nostrils. Regardless, definitely not a furniture shop.
5	Love this store! Great home decorating at very reasonable prices!
