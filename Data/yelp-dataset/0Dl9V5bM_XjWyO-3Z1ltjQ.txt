5	Great place! I loved the intimate atmosphere, not like your big salons on the strip but you get the same quality. Prices are reasonable. I had a shampoo and blow out from Misty and have already scheduled an appointment for color.
5	Misty Silverman [ (702) 927-7386 ] is awesome! Great cuts. Everything was even and healthy without taking off too much. She put in beautiful high and low lights all over they look fantastic! Very reasonably priced also!
1	The Saturday hours are wrong?! What are your hours? And why no answering machine when you call?
5	I love going to Lo to get my hair touched up when I'm in town.She does great cut and color at great prices and it's always a pleasure to chit chat with!
