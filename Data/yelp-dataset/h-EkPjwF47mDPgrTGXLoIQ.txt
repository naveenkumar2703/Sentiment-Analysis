3	I like to call this "My Basha's".    On the positive side, the selection of wine and beers is pretty extensive, the produce is fresh with quite a few organic choices.  The natural foods section has a number of pleasant surprises and they've added some new bulk dispensers there as well.  I've had mixed experiences getting help in the meat section but the checkout up front is always quick, much faster than some of the other grocery store chains out there.
4	For all my grocery needs, I choose this Basha's located on McQueen and Pecos in Chandler, AZ.  It's got decent prices on fresh bread and baked goods, especially those donuts, which I often pick up for work.  The vegetarian selection is average, and I can't complain about the selection, though I have seen better prices (at Trader Joe's.)  The seafood and deli departments are also great, and the customer service in each is also fantastic.  The store is kept clean and offers local products.  (I bought this great jack-o-lantern cactus at Halloween that was just perfect for an Arizona Halloween!)   The balloons and flowers also make for great last-minute gifts.  It's a convenient grocery store, with hours until after 10:00pm even on weekdays!  The prices are lower than Safeway and about equal to Fry's.
1	I used to have a Bashas next to my house which was great. They closed that location. I drove further just to find another Bashas rather than shop at Fryes. I was disappointed everytime I shopped at this Bashas. I know they were going through $$ issues but this place was horrible. I got chicken from the butcher area just to arrive home with rotten chicken that smelled really bad. The rest of the meat selection is also no good. They rarely had items in stock that I was used to buying. I now shop at Fryes.
