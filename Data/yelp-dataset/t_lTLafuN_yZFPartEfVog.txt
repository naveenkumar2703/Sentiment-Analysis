3	A big group of us went to Las Vegas for a film festival where a movie we made was screening, and were walking back to the hotel.  We thought we could pick up some beer or booze here, but it was not to be...  I did get an ice cream bar, though.Pretty much, this is a typical Walgreens.
3	There are always some characters in the parking lot here, but they staff extra security at this location to deal with any trouble makers. One of the security guards is actually Dog the Bounty Hunter. Wait. No. No it isn't. It's his nephew though. Wait, no... OK, fine. I have no clue who the guards are, but they do a good job. Ignoring the outside shenanigans, this is a solid Walgreens. Def bigger than the one on Fremont St and typically very quiet. They have a drive-thru pharmacy for those peeps who don't like looking another human in the eyes while picking up rx and typically 3 people staffing the inner pharmacy section. This helps with the wait time immensely. The rest of the store has everything you would find in a neighborhood convenience store. Bonus: There is a large liquor aisle for anyone that needs some liquid courage or a way to stop them shakes (I still love seeing liquor sold in non-liquor stores).
5	I don't like shopping at Walgreens due to the pharmacy issues. However, occasionally I stop at this one because it is by my office. There is a young female cashier that is always sooooo nice.   Next time I'll get her name so I can send her praises. She is the reason this walgreens gets five stars.
5	This Walgreens is in such a great location. Right when you're leaving Freemont street before you get back to the strip to your hotel, you can stop here are grab a bite. There's sooooo much parking. Finally! The staff & manager are so nice & friendly!! I went here a few times during my trip in Vegas. They definitely are good for a couple laughs. It's a very chill, relaxed vibe. I came here only at night though so I can't speak for the day employees. It's just great. ^,^
