1	I needed pants HEMMED for my grandfathers funeral and she wanted to charge me $32!!!! I said please these are just pants and she said that because they r wide hemmed that it'd be $32. Unless you have money to throw away I'd stay clear
1	Beware! This business does not honor any of the yelp deals listed! I purchased the $100 voucher for $75 and when I went to use it, the tailors there had no idea what it was, and said that the owner had never mentioned anything to them about it.  They also do not honor the 10% off check ins unless your alteration is over $100... Which is not notated as a requirement on the deal at all.  This horribly run business is misusing social media marketing, I am awaiting my refund from yelp and taking my business elsewhere.
1	$24 for a pair of pants, no discounts on multiple articles... RIP OFF, dont waste your time!!! I read bad press on Yelp but was at mall anyway so I stopped in. Thanks Yelpers for heads up.... stay far away from this joke of a business
