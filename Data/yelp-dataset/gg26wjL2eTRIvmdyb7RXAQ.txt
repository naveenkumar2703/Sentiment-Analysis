3	Outdated look, slow service, half star for gud customer service... I think ud get ur food faster going thru drive thru, which ill happily take next time I come here :)
5	I love this location.  The staff is always awesome and super friendly, especially at night :)  Out of the Taco Bell's I've been to in Phoenix, this is definitely my favorite for that very reason.
1	horrible service, in the drive thru the girl spills soda on me and instead of saying she is SORRY she says WELL HOW WAS I TO KNOW THERE WAS SODA ON THE LID? then she just walks off, doesn't offer me a napkin or say anything else, just left it for someone else to address... NEVER AGAIN!
