3	What?!?!? A clean Ross? Finally! No clothes on the floor, so white trash kids crawling all over me and no white trash mothers yelling at their white trash kids to get off of me. Glorious!I had a hell of a time finding what I came in for, which was a wallet. The Ross employee minions were no where to be found, so I was left to fend for myself. Why the three stars? Because I don't think a Ross can earn 5 stars, so this is my highest ranking.
4	Located inside of a larger shopping plaza this location is a great stop off for this chain. It is clean, well-organized and has a lot of options with a larger layout than some of the other stores in the area. The clothing section had a lot of options to look through, and as per usual for the chain.I really liked that this location was larger than the typical one and felt more spread out with room to walk between aisles and space to have two people pass one another without having to do that awkward turn sideways and smoosh up against the clothes thing.  Overall: A-We didn't end up getting anything here since I wasn't loving anything enough to buy, but we will for sure be back here!
4	Pretty standard as far as Ross stores go, but in a decent area and well kept. The staff was friendly and greeted us as soon as we walked through the door. I typically give Ross locations 3 stars, but because of the location and cleanliness this one gets a 4.
3	This Ross store itself is nice, not over crowded and clean.However, it's fairly empty of actual products.I was able to find a pair of shoes but that is rare for this location.They have some nice art  and furniture but not much.From the looks of the bare shelves, I don't see how they will stay open for too much longer. Conveniently located near many other shops on this happy valley & lake pleasant corner.
