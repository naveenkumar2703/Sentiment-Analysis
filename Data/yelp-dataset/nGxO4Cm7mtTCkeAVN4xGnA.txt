5	I love this store and I love this location! I shop during the week so it's never busy when I shop. And I like the personal attention I get from the staff.Love love love the sales!! Especially the scented candles and wallflowers.  I admit it, I spent a bunch a money. But I know it all gets used and our home smells lovely!
4	Great central location for the East Valley, but heavy sales tactics. Also, asked to have my gift items wrapped - even bought a gift bag. All the clerk did was put the items IN the gift bag. I could have done that! Over the top customer service would have been great, and would have balanced out the pushy sales clerk. Ah well, at least I like the gifts I chose.
