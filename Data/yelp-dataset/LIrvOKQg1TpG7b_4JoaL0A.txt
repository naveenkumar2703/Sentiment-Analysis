5	I like this supercuts as they are always friendly and professional.
5	I came into Phoenix from Los Angeles for my grandmothers birthday. I needed an affordable and good cut. I frequently use supercuts here in LA and am always happy. I called in ahead and when i walked in i was greeted by a stylist named April. April was very polite and listened to me as i explained what i wanted my hair to look like. I also got a deep condition, which i highly recommend because the dry heat in Arizona is harsh on the scalp. At least for me. April gave me a very relaxing shampoo, she cut my hair exactly how i wanted it and gave me a really good deep conditioning. My hair is very thick and curly. And any stylist that can work with thick and curly can work with any hair. If you are looking for a high end salon cut and deep condition for a price a middle class person like myself can afford, then i suggest you call supercuts at the Christown mall and make sure April cut's your hair. You will not be unhappy.
5	This is my second time using this Supercuts location, but the first time for myself. I had gotten my son's hair cut there previously and had a good experience. Today's experience was great! April was able to recreate the cut I wanted from pictures of two different cuts. She nailed it and it looks great. I am so happy. Love this Supercuts and will return again. The quality of a high end salon without the high price.
5	I absolutely  love this place! Mercedes has always treated me like we have known each other for years! I always feel so welcome and at home when I come to visit. I come to get my eyebrows done once a month and have now built friendships with alot of the associates in this store. Danielle is such a sweetie, gives me the latest gossip about the kardashians and Frank is such a lady killer! This staff is some of the best around! I definantly recommend this place not only for customer service but for there products! Keep up the good work!
